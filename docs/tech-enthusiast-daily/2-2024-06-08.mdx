The 2Africa undersea cable, the world's longest at 45,000 kilometers, has connected Cornwall, UK. This system is jointly owned by several telecom giants with the aim of enhancing internet connectivity across Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. Vodafone leads the UK access, ensuring the cable is safely buried and seamlessly integrated with terrestrial networks. The cable boasts a transmission capacity of up to 180 terabits per second, achieving the first full coverage of the African continent, connecting 33 countries. It is now partially operational and is expected to significantly improve regional internet performance.

High-profile tech CEOs, including Microsoft's Satya Nadella and Adobe's Shantanu Narayen, are investing nearly a billion dollars to popularize cricket in the U.S. through Major League Cricket. This league, featuring six professional teams, aims to mainstream cricket, targeting the large South Asian diaspora in America, known for their high incomes and passion for the sport. The Men's T20 Cricket World Cup, co-hosted by the U.S., has already witnessed a historic upset with the U.S. team defeating Pakistan.

### Guide to Taking Scrolling Screenshots on iPhone

Taking a screenshot on an iPhone is straightforward, involving a quick press of the volume up and side buttons. For longer captures, known as scrolling screenshots, the process is slightly more involved. These screenshots allow you to capture an entire webpage, document, or email in one go, rather than stitching together multiple images.

To create a scrolling screenshot:
1. Take a regular screenshot using the side and volume up buttons (or side/top and home buttons for Touch ID models).
2. Quickly tap the preview that appears in the bottom-left corner.
3. Select "Full Page" to see a preview of the entire capture.
4. Edit if necessary, then choose "Done."
5. Save as a PDF to Files or, if available, to Photos.

Long screenshots are typically saved as PDFs in the Files app, where they can be viewed, edited, and shared. If the screenshot fits within the screen's dimensions, it may also be saved directly to Photos.

This feature simplifies the capture of lengthy content, enhancing the iPhone's utility for documentation and sharing.

### China's Rapid Advance in Renewable Energy Sets Global Benchmark

China's rapid transition to renewable energy, known as the "Green Speed," has garnered worldwide attention. In 2023, while some countries scaled back their renewable energy goals, China advanced significantly, becoming the only nation where the share of electricity in energy consumption consistently increased. The country installed over half of the world's new solar capacity and over 60% of wind power, doubling its solar and wind installations within just three years.

China's electric vehicle market penetration exceeds 30%, starkly contrasting with under 10% in the U.S. This acceleration in green energy could potentially lead to China's carbon emissions peaking earlier than its 2030 pledge. Analysts and experts, including those from the Norwegian International Climate and Environment Center, are astounded by China's unprecedented pace in renewable energy, signaling a new era in global climate efforts.

This "Green Speed" is crucial for global carbon reduction, providing a model for developing countries to adopt green technologies at lower costs. The complexity of this transition, requiring significant investment and policy coordination, underscores China's leadership in energy innovation, supported by decades of focused policy on technology.

China's advancements in green energy are not only a national achievement but also a significant contribution to global climate action, signaling a transformative shift in the world's energy base.

### May 2024: The Hottest Ever, Climate Crisis Intensifies

  alt="May 2024: The Hottest Ever, Climate Crisis Intensifies"
/>

In May 2024, Earth experienced the hottest May on record. Data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) revealed that the global average temperature was 0.65°C higher than the 1991-2020 average and 1.52°C above pre-industrial levels.

This marked the 12th consecutive month where global temperatures set records for their respective months. Over the past 12 months, the global average temperature was 0.75°C higher than the 1991-2020 average and 1.63°C above the pre-industrial levels of 1850-1900.

Citing C3S data, the UN Secretary-General called for urgent action. The World Meteorological Organization warned that we are approaching the climate thresholds set by the Paris Agreement. It is projected that between 2024 and 2028, global average temperatures will be 1.1°C to 1.9°C higher than pre-industrial levels.

The rate of global warming has reached a historic high, increasing by 0.26°C per decade. The remaining carbon budget, which is the amount of CO2 that can be emitted before causing global warming of 1.5°C, is only about 200 gigatons, equivalent to five years of emissions.

Climate change data casts a clear and unforgiving shadow, much like the harsh sun. We stand at a historical turning point, with each degree of warming posing a challenge to our future. The time for action is now; otherwise, we will be unable to reverse this trend.

  alt="Taobao Tmall updates its rating system, strengthening the impact of store experience scores on search rankings."
/>

Summary:

Recently, Taobao Tmall has implemented a new scoring system, replacing the previous DSR evaluation system with "Store Experience Scores" and "Product Experience Index." This change directly impacts search rankings and store traffic. Stores with higher experience scores will appear higher in search results, attracting more traffic. Taobao Tmall emphasizes user experience and encourages merchants to enhance service quality. Merchants can view their experience scores through the "Qianniu Backend" and display relevant service indicators, such as shipping speed and customer service response time, on product detail pages, which directly influence consumer decisions.

Explanation:

- **DSR (Detailed Seller Ratings):** The previous seller service evaluation system on Taobao, which included ratings for product description accuracy, seller service attitude, and logistics service quality.
- **Store Experience Score:** Part of the new evaluation system, it comprehensively assesses store service quality and directly affects the store's visibility and traffic on the platform.
- **Product Experience Index:** A measure of product service quality, including factors like shipping speed and customer service responsiveness, which directly impact consumer purchasing decisions.
- **Qianniu Backend:** A management tool for Taobao merchants, where they can view and manage store data.

Insights:

This strategic adjustment by Taobao Tmall signifies a shift from mere price competition to competition based on service quality in the e-commerce platform. By enhancing user experience, merchants not only strengthen customer loyalty but also stand out in the fiercely competitive market. This transformation presents both challenges and opportunities for merchants, requiring them to re-evaluate and optimize their service processes to meet the growing expectations of consumers.
