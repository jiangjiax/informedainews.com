NASA's James Webb Telescope has revealed a galaxy, JADES-GS-z14-0, dating back to just 2.9 billion years after the Big Bang. This galaxy, with a redshift of 14.32, breaks previous records, suggesting an unexpectedly swift formation of galaxies in the universe's early stages.

The discovery, part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), employed the telescope's Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Spectrograph (NIRSpec) to capture and analyze the light from this distant galaxy. The high redshift indicates that the light has been stretched to longer, redder wavelengths due to the universe's expansion, enabling Webb's instruments to detect it.

This galaxy's luminosity and size—over 1600 light-years in diameter—imply a mass several hundred million times that of the Sun, challenging existing theories on early galaxy formation. Furthermore, the presence of oxygen suggests that multiple generations of massive stars had already formed and perished, enriching the galaxy with heavy elements.

These findings not only establish a new distance record but also underscore the complexity and rapid evolution of galaxies in the universe's early epochs. This discovery provides a fresh perspective on understanding the initial stages of cosmic structure formation.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is investigating small, potentially habitable exoplanets by analyzing their atmospheres using transmission spectroscopy. This task is intricate due to the faint signals and prolonged observation times needed. Exoplanets, abundant in our galaxy, orbit within habitable zones around stars, though not all are assured to harbor life.

JWST concentrates on transiting exoplanets, whose orbital alignments allow direct observation of their atmospheres. Identifying atmospheric components, particularly water vapor and biosignatures, is challenging due to the thin atmospheres of rocky planets and the obscuring effects of clouds or haze.

Recent research on exoplanet LHS 1140 b indicates that detecting biosignatures might necessitate up to 200 hours of observation under optimal conditions. The concept of ocean planets, featuring thin hydrogen atmospheres above extensive liquid water oceans, presents a novel approach for biosignature detection.

JWST's capabilities facilitate the sensitive detection of crucial life-indicating molecules. Although definitive evidence of habitability is still elusive, JWST's discoveries will guide future missions, such as the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, setting the stage for a dedicated observatory to search for life on Earth-like planets.

The quest for life beyond Earth is demanding, requiring ideal conditions and extensive observation. Nonetheless, this pursuit is vital, as each discovery brings us closer to comprehending our cosmic context.

Yesterday, I attended a livestream organized by @Amateur8888, aka Brother Pi. Surprisingly, Brother Pi didn't charge anything and generously shared his valuable experiences with us for free. Brother Pi recommended a tool for selecting directions: New Rank: https://www.newrank.cn/. I've also been researching WeChat Official Accounts, and the biggest challenge is the 'cold start' for new accounts. Without relying on one's own social circle, using algorithmic recommendations alone, there's hardly any audience.

We are launching the first-ever tech accelerator for individuals under 20. Inspired by the Thiel Fellowship and Y Combinator, we have developed an accelerator model that follows a "bootcamp-hackathon-incubator" approach, designed to accelerate the first entrepreneurial venture of young individuals. The Thiel Fellowship, established in 2014, notably discovered Vitalik, while YC has long been recognized as the most prestigious startup incubator in the industry. We are not a startup school, nor are we a mere replication of existing models.

Restoring a 10th generation Mac mini, specifically the 2009 2.26 Core Duo 2-based model, requires careful disassembly and attention to detail. This model, known for its polycarbonate and aluminum shell, differs from earlier minis with internal improvements that simplify refurbishment.

Tools needed include a spackling tool, screwdrivers, a spudger, scissors, compressed air, and a flashlight. The process begins by opening the case with the spackling tool, then removing the DVD-R drive and its associated components. Later models feature a lighter, quieter DVD drive, though with slower access times.

Next, remove the drive carrier by unscrewing it from the base. This step reveals the motherboard and other internal components, which require careful handling to avoid damage.

Refurbishing these older Mac minis can breathe new life into them, making them functional and efficient despite their age. However, the process demands precision and patience, suitable only for those confident in their technical abilities.

  alt="Strategic Board Game 'Trajan' Explained: A Historical and Strategic Challenge"
/>

In "圖拉真《Trajan》桌遊教學框架," the author outlines the strategic complexities of a board game inspired by the Roman Emperor Trajan. Players vie to become his favored successor by excelling in various domains: military, trade, construction, and political influence. The game spans four years, each divided into seasons, with strategic decisions affecting outcomes.

The setup involves selecting key game components and distributing resources. Each player's turn revolves around a "播棋" mechanism, determining actions based on where the pieces land. Actions include trading goods, mobilizing troops, influencing the senate, gathering intelligence, and constructing buildings.

Success hinges on balancing immediate gains with long-term strategies, as unused resources at game's end yield points. The detailed guide serves as a reusable framework for teaching the game, emphasizing the importance of understanding each action's implications.

This game not only entertains but also subtly teaches the dynamics of leadership and resource management, making it a cerebral pastime. The strategic depth and historical context enrich the gaming experience, offering more than mere diversion.

5. We often hear about legendary entrepreneurial stories where the protagonist, by solving their own problems, ultimately creates a product that is well-received. I believe many have experienced this: encountering a problem and wondering if it could be turned into a product, or facing a product that few users are interested in. If you feel these successes seem accidental and lack a systematic methodology to aid decision-making, you need to understand the 4U Framework. —— [北火](https://x.com/beihuo/status/1799955897307009272)
