/>

Scientists have determined that a seagrass in the Baltic Sea is 1402 years old, making it the oldest known marine plant. This finding was achieved through a novel genetic clock technique developed by a team from various universities. The method monitors the accumulation of somatic mutations, akin to cancer's evolution, enabling precise dating of clonal populations.

Detailed in "Nature Ecology & Evolution," this technique could revolutionize the study of clonal species, which reproduce asexually and can cover extensive areas, comparable to a football field. These species, including corals and certain algae, maintain genetic similarity among their clones but are not genetically identical due to these mutations.

This breakthrough not only offers a tool for accurately dating clonal organisms but also aids in understanding their resilience in changing environments. It paves the way for improved conservation strategies, particularly for endangered species like corals under extreme heat stress.

The team expects to discover even older seagrass clones, potentially ranking them as the oldest living organisms on Earth. This research highlights the effectiveness of interdisciplinary collaboration in advancing ecological and evolutionary science.

### Effective Strategies for Writing Clear and Actionable Meeting Minutes

To craft effective meeting minutes, start with a rough draft that captures all content and key points. Use tools like voice recorders to fully transcribe discussions, complemented by manual notes on critical details such as speakers, arguments, and resolutions.

A structured template helps maintain focus on essentials without falling behind the meeting's pace. This template, similar to a fill-in-the-blank exercise, ensures comprehensive coverage of key points.

The final draft, designed for colleagues, should succinctly convey the meeting's essence, including major viewpoints, decisions, and action items. Collaborative tools enhance transparency and follow-up, ensuring that the meeting's outcomes are not only documented but also acted upon.

Remember, the aim is clarity and actionability, making the meeting's outcomes accessible and actionable for all involved.
