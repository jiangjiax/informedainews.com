### UN Warns of Impending Climate Milestone: Temporary Breach of 1.5°C Threshold Likely

The UN weather agency warns: within five years, we'll likely breach 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels—a critical threshold. This temporary spike, once deemed improbable, now looms with an 80% chance. The Paris Agreement aimed to cap warming at this level, fearing escalating extreme weather beyond it.

Current warming, even below 1.5°C, spawns devastating heatwaves, floods, and droughts. UN Secretary-General António Guterres likens our course to Russian roulette, urging decisive action in the next 18 months.

The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) predicts annual temperatures 1.1°C to 1.9°C above the 1850-1900 baseline. A 50-50 chance exists that the average over the next five years will exceed 1.5°C. A new annual temperature record is likely, surpassing 2023's peak.

The WMO's alarm underscores our urgent need to curb greenhouse gas emissions, lest we face escalating economic, environmental, and human costs.

### Record-Breaking Temperatures Highlight Urgent Need for Climate Action

The Earth has experienced a relentless year of record-breaking temperatures, with each month setting new heat records. The global average temperature for the past 12 months has risen to 1.63°C above the pre-industrial average, a grim milestone reported by Copernicus, the European Union's climate monitoring service.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urges world leaders and corporations to urgently reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase climate finance, and regulate the fossil fuel industry within the next 18 months. The planet's distress signals are clear, yet our response remains inadequate.

Scientists attribute the accelerated warming to El Niño, a natural cycle in the Pacific Ocean that influences global weather patterns, and a reduction in shipping pollution, which normally reflects heat back into space. The World Meteorological Organization predicts an 80% chance of the annual average global temperature exceeding 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels in at least one of the next five years.

Despite these alarming trends, temporary temperature spikes do not signify permanent failure of the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C goal, which refers to long-term warming over decades. However, every fraction of a degree matters, as it amplifies the severity of climate impacts.

In the past year, extreme weather events—heat waves, droughts, floods, and wildfires—have become the norm, underscoring the urgent need for climate adaptation strategies. The stark reality is that climate change is no longer a distant threat but a present, relentless force.

  alt="Gene Therapy Restores Hearing in Deaf Children: A Medical Breakthrough"
/>

Gene therapy has restored hearing in five deaf children, aged one to eleven, in a groundbreaking trial. These children, born with a genetic condition called DFNB9, lacked a protein essential for hearing. The therapy, developed by researchers at Fudan University and Harvard's Massachusetts Eye and Ear, uses a harmless virus to deliver a functional gene, Otof, into the inner ear. This enables the production of the missing protein, otoferlin, crucial for auditory signals.

Within weeks of treatment, the children could locate sounds and understand speech, even in noisy environments. Video evidence showed a two-year-old boy responding to his name and dancing to music, activities he previously ignored. The oldest patient, an 11-year-old girl, progressed from no response to tones to participating in speech training.

This therapy not only offers hope for children with DFNB9 but also opens possibilities for treating other forms of deafness, whether genetic or not. However, larger trials are needed to fully assess the therapy's benefits and risks, particularly the immune response triggered by the viral delivery method.

The implications of this breakthrough are profound, potentially transforming the lives of millions affected by hearing loss. It marks a significant step towards personalized medicine, where treatments are tailored to the genetic makeup of individuals, offering a new era in the treatment of deafness.

### Cara: A New Social Platform for Artists Escaping Meta's AI Policies

Artists, frustrated by Meta's AI training on their work, have turned to Cara, a platform that respects copyright. In a week, Cara grew from 40,000 to 650,000 users.

Meta, owner of Instagram, uses public posts to train its AI, with only European users able to opt out due to GDPR—a regulation that protects personal data. This practice led artists to seek alternatives.

Jingna Zhang, a photographer and Cara's founder, experienced this firsthand, winning a copyright case against an artist who used her work without consent. Cara, blending Instagram and microblogging, allows artists to share without fear of AI exploitation.

Zhang is also fighting tech giants like Google and Stability AI for unauthorized use of artists' work in their AI systems. Cara partners with the University of Chicago's Glaze project to prevent AI scraping of artists' work.

Despite financial hurdles, including a recent $96,280 hosting bill, Zhang's commitment to a rights-respecting community remains strong. In an AI-dominated world, Cara offers artists a safe space to share their creations without exploitation.
