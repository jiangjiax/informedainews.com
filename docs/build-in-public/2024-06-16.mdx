# Announcement of New Publication Launch

Hello, I'm Jiang.

On June 5, 2024, Informed AI News was launched. Following this, on June 6, the Tech Enthusiast Weekly and AI Enthusiast Weekly (originally in daily format) were introduced. On June 7, Informed AI News conducted its first promotional campaign, successfully attracting 55 new users. To date, Informed AI News has been operational for 11 days, accumulating 2,189 new users and 24,032 page views, with users from China, the United States, Singapore, Japan, Canada, the UK, Australia, Germany, and more.

Throughout its development and maintenance, Informed AI News has been a solo project of mine. It is the first product that truly belongs to me; it was not developed for a company or to contribute surplus value to capitalists. Instead, it is entirely based on my personal interest and effort. Therefore, I am passionate about enhancing the quality of Informed AI News and am committed to continuous improvement to make it even better.

Today, I have launched a new publication, "Informed AI News Build-In-Public," aimed at further improving the quality of Informed AI News. I will update this publication periodically, openly sharing the update process of Informed AI News, allowing all users to participate. I also look forward to receiving your valuable feedback.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me. I will carefully read all emails and comments from readers and strive to continually improve Informed AI News.

Enjoy your reading!

From Jiang.

# Future Update Plans

As the sole developer of Informed AI News, I must focus my limited energy on the most popular features.

Future updates are expected to include the following features:

1. More powerful algorithm support, improving the scoring rules for selected information, increasing the quality and diversity of information.

2. Improved text summaries for easier readability.

3. Launch of a tool recommendation feature, aggregating and recommending internet tool information.

4. Image compression feature, compressing images displayed in articles to consume less data.

5. New daily or weekly publications in different fields (e.g., Stock Market Enthusiast Weekly).

6. Expansion of Japanese information sources and addition of Japanese language support.

7. Addition of RSS support.

If you have any specific feature needs or other suggestions, please leave a message or send an email to my inbox. I am very much looking forward to hearing your valuable opinions!
