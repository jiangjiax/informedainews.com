DJI Automotive, a spin-off from the drone giant DJI, is transforming the affordability of driver assistance technology in cars. Utilizing drone technology, they provide Level 2 autonomy at a mere 5,000 yuan per vehicle, making it feasible even for cars priced around 100,000 yuan. This starkly contrasts with competitors like Huawei, whose systems are usually integrated into more expensive models.

At least 20 new models this year will incorporate DJI's technology, which employs cameras and affordable semiconductors instead of expensive lidar and radar systems. This method, inspired by DJI's Phantom 4 drone technology, enables vehicles to adjust their direction and speed based on camera inputs.

The attraction of DJI Automotive's technology is its cost-effectiveness, which could expedite the adoption of driver assistance systems. China, emphasizing such technology, targets Level 2 and 3 vehicles to account for 70% of new sales by 2030, with Level 4 vehicles comprising 20%.

DJI Automotive intends to launch a more advanced system by the end of the year, capable of self-driving on regular roads, priced at 7,000 yuan per vehicle. This initiative could further democratize autonomous driving technology, making it accessible to a wider market.

Level 2 autonomy pertains to systems that can manage both steering and acceleration/deceleration under specific conditions, necessitating the driver to monitor the environment and be prepared to intervene. Level 4 autonomy allows the vehicle to handle all driving aspects in certain conditions without human intervention.

## AI News

### NVIDIA Surpasses Apple in Market Cap, Reaching $3 Trillion

Summary:
On June 5, NVIDIA, a leading tech company, surpassed Apple in market capitalization, reaching $3 trillion. This milestone positions NVIDIA as the second-largest U.S. company by market value. Analysts attribute this surge to NVIDIA's strong performance in the stock market and its strategic positioning in the rapidly growing field of artificial intelligence. In contrast, Apple's market performance has been relatively stagnant, partly due to its slower integration of AI technologies.

NVIDIA's upcoming stock split, converting one share into ten, is expected to make the stock more accessible to individual investors, potentially boosting its market presence further.

Explanation:
- Market Capitalization: The total value of all a company's shares of stock. It is calculated by multiplying the price of a stock by the total number of outstanding shares.
- Stock Split: A corporate action where a company divides its existing shares into multiple shares to boost the stock's liquidity. Although the number of shares increases by a specific multiple, the total dollar value of the shares remains the same compared to pre-split amounts, except for adjustments in the stock price to reflect the split.

Insights:
NVIDIA's meteoric rise underscores the market's appetite for companies at the forefront of technological innovation, particularly in AI. The stock split, by making shares more affordable, could democratize investment in such high-growth sectors, potentially influencing broader market dynamics and investor behavior.

Nvidia, a leading manufacturer of AI chips, has eclipsed Apple in market value, soaring to $3.012 trillion. This milestone elevates Nvidia to the second most valuable company worldwide, trailing only Microsoft, valued at $3.15 trillion.

The surge in Nvidia's fortunes is largely attributed to a dramatic increase in demand for its AI processors. This demand is being driven by major tech players such as Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet, who are rapidly enhancing their AI capabilities. Nvidia's stock has experienced an astonishing 147% growth in 2024 alone, a clear indication of robust investor confidence in the future of AI.

Conversely, Apple is grappling with issues including a downturn in iPhone sales and fierce competition in the Chinese market. There is a perception among some investors that Apple is lagging behind its competitors in integrating AI into its product offerings.

Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, has emerged as a key figure in the tech industry, recognized for steering the company through its AI-centric expansion. Despite its rapid ascent, Nvidia maintains a relatively modest price-to-earnings ratio, currently trading at 39 times expected earnings, a significant decrease from over 70 a year ago.

This change in market leadership highlights the increasing significance of AI in technology and reflects the evolving landscape of Silicon Valley's leading companies.

At Computex 2024, the tech industry's top executives, including Intel's Pat Gelsinger, AMD's Lisa Su, and Qualcomm's Cristiano Amon, proclaimed AI as the driving force behind a PC renaissance. This transformation is set to invigorate a previously stagnant market, with AI-optimized PCs ready to deliver advanced capabilities such as real-time translation and AI assistants, which were once reliant on cloud services.

Competition is fierce among Intel, AMD, and the emerging Qualcomm. Intel's Lunar Lake chipset is capable of 48 trillion operations per second (TOPS), while AMD's Ryzen AI 300 series boasts 50 TOPS, both crucial benchmarks for AI processing power. Qualcomm, traditionally known for smartphone chips, is making a significant move into the laptop market with its Snapdragon X Elite chip, which meets Microsoft's AI PC requirement of over 40 TOPS.

The industry is transitioning from the traditional X86 architecture, which is performance-oriented, to Arm-based processors, which are known for their energy efficiency. Qualcomm forecasts that half of PCs will adopt Arm architecture, a shift that is being expedited by Microsoft's AI platform, Copilot+. Apple's transition to Arm for MacBooks is a prime example of this trend, already holding 11% of the market.

As AI remodels the PC landscape, the race is heating up to determine who will lead in this new era of computing. The outcome will not only reshape the market leaders but also redefine the essence of personal computing.
