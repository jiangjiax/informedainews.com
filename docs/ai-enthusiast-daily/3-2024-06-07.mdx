# AI Enthusiast Weekly(2024-06-07) : Apple's WWDC 2024: Software Updates and Potential AI Enhancements

## Apple's WWDC 2024: Software Updates and Potential AI Enhancements

Apple's WWDC 2024 commences on June 10, focusing on software updates and developer tools. The keynote, scheduled for 10 a.m. ET, will unveil iOS 18, iPadOS, macOS 15, and more, with live streaming available on Apple's website and YouTube, though potential lag may occur on the latter platform.

Critics have consistently noted Apple's delay in adopting generative AI, a technology capable of creating content from existing data. CEO Tim Cook, hinting at transformation, may announce a speculated collaboration with OpenAI, famous for its GPT models that produce text akin to human writing.

Anticipation for AI improvements in iOS 18 is substantial, with potential integration into macOS 15. Hardware updates, typically unpredictable at this software-focused event, are unlikely this year, despite precedents such as Apple Silicon and the Vision Pro.

The event will also showcase significant design alterations to the iPhone's Calculator app, a small yet significant update. TechCrunch plans to provide live coverage from Apple Park, ensuring timely updates.

### Google's NotebookLM AI Tool Expands Globally, Enhancing Document Analysis

Google's NotebookLM, an AI note-taking assistant, now serves over 200 countries, including India and the UK. Initially based in the U.S. and previously known as Project Tailwind, it utilizes Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro AI to summarize documents and answer queries based on user-uploaded content. Unlike typical AI chatbots, NotebookLM strictly adheres to source materials, ensuring accuracy and relevance.

With support for 108 languages, it extracts information from various formats such as Google Slides, web URLs, PDFs, and text files. Features like inline citations enable users to verify AI responses against original sources. NotebookLM assists in creating documents like FAQs and study guides, and has been employed for tasks such as summarizing interview transcripts and drafting grant proposals.

Google ensures privacy, stating that user data is not used to train its algorithms, thereby protecting the confidentiality of documents. This free service positions NotebookLM as a formidable competitor in the AI-driven document summarization market, traditionally dominated by paid startup tools.

### Cara: A New Social Platform for Artists Escaping Meta's AI Policies

Artists, frustrated by Meta's AI training on their work, have turned to Cara, a platform that respects copyright. In a week, Cara grew from 40,000 to 650,000 users.

Meta, the owner of Instagram, utilizes public posts to train AI, with only European users able to opt out due to GDPR—a regulation safeguarding personal data. This practice prompted artists to explore alternatives. Jingna Zhang, Cara's founder and a photographer, personally experienced this issue, successfully winning a copyright case against an unauthorized user of her work.

Cara, which combines elements of Instagram and microblogging, ensures that artists can share their work without it being used for AI training. Zhang is also battling tech giants like Google and Stability AI over the unauthorized use of artists' work in their AI systems.

Cara collaborates with the University of Chicago's Glaze project to thwart AI scraping of artists' work. Despite facing financial challenges, including a recent $96,280 hosting bill, Zhang remains steadfast in her mission to protect artists' rights.

In an era where AI poses a threat to creative integrity, Cara serves as a sanctuary, enabling artists to share freely, without the fear of exploitation.

At the 360 AI launch, CEO Zhou Hongyi introduced 360 AI甄选, a platform dedicated to promoting AI tools. He openly discussed his live streaming venture as a strategic marketing approach for AI products.

360 AI甄选 operates by collecting recommendations from both developers and users, which are then evaluated by experts. Tools that receive approval gain increased visibility through influencer networks. Additionally, 360 offers a membership service, granting access to over 100 office tools for an annual fee of 216元.

Zhou acknowledged the challenge of integrating AI into daily life, emphasizing the versatility of AI models but their current lack of compelling applications. He praised the AI tool Kimi for its focused marketing strategy, suggesting it as a model for others to follow.

360's goal is not only to develop AI tools but also to cultivate a marketplace and community, bridging the gap between AI technology and user needs.

The article praises the virtues of a new model, KLING, developed by the tech company Kuaishou. This model excels in two primary areas: first, it generates videos from text, rivaling the capabilities of Sora; second, it creates videos from images with remarkable smoothness.

KLING, short for "可灵大模型" in Chinese, is a sophisticated AI tool designed to convert written descriptions into video content. This function competes directly with Sora, another leading platform in the field of text-to-video generation. The innovation here lies in the seamless translation of ideas from the page to the screen, a process that typically requires substantial human input.

Additionally, KLING impresses with its ability to transform static images into dynamic videos. The term "丝滑" (silk smooth) aptly describes the fluidity and quality of the video output, suggesting a level of sophistication and ease that is both rare and commendable in this technology.

For those unfamiliar, Kuaishou is a major Chinese social media and video sharing platform, akin to YouTube or TikTok. Their development of KLING underscores a significant advancement in the realm of AI-driven content creation, pushing boundaries in how we visualize and share stories.

This tool, with its dual capabilities, marks a notable stride in the evolution of digital storytelling and content creation.
