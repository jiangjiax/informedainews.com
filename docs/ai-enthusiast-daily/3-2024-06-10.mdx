### Revolutionary AI-Powered Glasses with Stereoscopic Display

At Stanford, a team led by Gordon Wetzstein has developed glasses that integrate effortlessly into daily attire, yet conceal a groundbreaking display technology. These glasses, appearing unremarkably ordinary, project AI-generated 3D images directly onto standard lenses. The key lies in a nanophotonic metasurface waveguide—a piece of glass embedded with microscopic optical elements that manipulate light.

Unlike current VR and AR headsets, which present a single image to both eyes, these glasses provide a stereoscopic view, closely replicating natural vision. Each eye receives a slightly different image, which significantly enhances the realism of the experience. This technology holds potential beyond immersive gaming; it could assist surgeons in navigating complex procedures or help mechanics with detailed repairs.

The prototype, although not yet tested on humans, weighs less than half of Apple's Vision Pro. Future developments aim for further miniaturization and enhanced power efficiency. This innovation could effectively merge the boundaries between virtual and actual reality, offering a perceptually authentic experience indistinguishable from the real world.

  alt="AI Demand Drives Memory Market Super Cycle, Supply Shortages Expected in 2025"
/>

Summary:
The memory market is on the brink of a "super cycle" driven by the escalating demand for AI and insufficient capital investments over the past two years. This supply-demand imbalance is projected to reach its zenith in 2025, with DRAM and HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) experiencing substantial shortages. HBM, a specialized DRAM variant tailored for high-performance computing, is anticipated to see its demand soar, possibly constituting 30% of total DRAM usage.

The absence of new manufacturing facilities and the decline in capital expenditure since 2022 have intensified the supply shortage. Memory product prices are expected to escalate dramatically, with HBM and server DRAM spearheading the price hike. Companies such as SK Hynix and Samsung, strategically positioned in the market, are likely to reap significant benefits, with their market shares and profitability poised for growth.

Insights:
This cycle diverges from historical trends due to the unique surge in demand from AI applications and the underinvestment in capacity expansion. The transition towards HBM, which demands more wafer capacity per bit and has lower production yields, further exacerbates the supply challenges. As customers prioritize securing supply over price, the fundamental dynamics of the memory market are shifting, favoring entities with strong production capabilities.

Explanations:
- **DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory):** A type of memory commonly used in computers and other devices for temporary data storage.
- **HBM (High Bandwidth Memory):** A high-performance variant of DRAM that utilizes stacked memory chips, primarily employed in advanced computing systems such as AI servers.
- **Capital Expenditure (CapEx):** The funds utilized by a company to acquire, upgrade, or maintain physical assets like factories, machinery, or equipment.
- **Wafer:** A thin slice of semiconductor material used in the production of integrated circuits.

### Fire Ants' Raft Formation Inspires Resilient Material Design

<img
  src="https://image.informedainews.com/2024/06/10/Ar-otG-1717983379-0.jpg"
  alt="Fire Ants' Raft Formation Inspires Resilient Material Design"
/>

Summary:
New research at Binghamton University investigates how fire ants form rafts to survive floods. By clinging together, these ants create a buoyant structure that floats on water. Led by Rob Wagner, the study uncovers a unique "catch-bond" behavior where ant bonds strengthen under stress, unlike typical materials that weaken. This adaptability could inspire new materials that self-reinforce under mechanical stress, potentially benefiting fields like biomedicine and robotics.

Explanation:
- Catch-bond behavior: This phenomenon describes how bonds between molecules or entities (in this case, ants) become stronger when subjected to pulling forces, contrary to most materials where bonds typically weaken under stress.
- Biomedical implants and soft robotics: These are fields where materials must withstand varying mechanical stresses. Biomedical implants are devices placed inside the body, and soft robotics involves creating robots from flexible, elastic materials.

Insights:
The resilience of fire ants in forming rafts under duress offers a profound lesson in adaptability and collective survival. Wagner's research not only highlights the potential of biomimicry in engineering but also underscores the complexity of natural systems, which often outperform engineered materials. This study could pave the way for smarter, more resilient materials that mimic the self-reinforcing mechanisms found in nature.

4. Thanks Ashok! Ashok was the first person to join the Tesla AI/Autopilot team and ultimately rose to lead all AI/Autopilot software. Without him and our awesome team, we would just be another car company looking for an autonomy supplier that doesn’t exist.

5. Mark Gurman: Power On: Apple's AI initiative is less about enhancing its current devices and more about paving the way for its next generation of hardware, ranging from AR glasses to AirPods equipped with cameras, and potentially even humanoid robots and beyond. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-09/apple-wwdc-ai-announcements-will-enable-home-robot-ar-glasses-camera-airpods-lx7jem9f —— [Ryan Morrison](https://x.com/RyanMorrisonJer/status/1799797709320360190)

6. This chart illustrates the metrics and framework for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) evaluation, divided into three main sections: Retrieval, Generation/Hallucination, and End-to-End. The evaluation metrics for the Retrieval section include Recall, Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and Mean Average Precision (MAP). The Generation/Hallucination section features three types of evaluation: n-gram-based assessments such as BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR. —— [Y11](https://x.com/seclink/status/1799676312388252128)

7. Adobe has updated its terms of service to allow the use of cloud-stored content for AI training by default. This has prompted some creators to start using Nightshade as a countermeasure. Nightshade is a defense mechanism specifically designed to combat unauthorized use of AI technology. Essentially, it involves embedding "poison" into your data; if someone uses this data without permission to train their AI model, the model will be misled and its performance will degrade.

Eduardo Valdés-Hevia 👁️: I don't use Adobe's Creative Cloud because I prefer keeping my files locally. However, given their stance on using any uploaded content for AI training, I'm filling my entire 20 GB storage with random Nightshade-poisoned images. I encourage others to do the same! —— [北火](https://x.com/beihuo/status/1799863218422337836)
