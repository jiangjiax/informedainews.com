  alt="AI-powered electron microscopy reveals battery failure mechanisms, aiding the development of new materials."
/>

Researcher Wang Chunyang from the Institute of Metal Research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences has developed a super-resolution transmission electron microscopy imaging technique by integrating deep learning with atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging. This technology has revealed the complex phase interface structures, phase transformation failure mechanisms, and mechanical instability mechanisms of layered oxide cathode materials in lithium-ion batteries. Wang Chunyang's research not only deepens the understanding of the failure mechanisms of layered oxides but also guides the development of next-generation battery cathode materials.

Layered oxides are key materials for lithium-ion batteries, but their phase transformation degradation and stress-induced failure issues limit battery performance. Wang Chunyang's research has revealed, at the atomic scale, the delithiation-induced lattice instability leading to the O3→O1 phase transformation in layered oxides, and found that this transformation is not entirely reversible. Additionally, he discovered a stress-induced phase transformation mechanism that challenges traditional understandings.

Based on these findings, Wang Chunyang designed new high-nickel cathode materials, which maintain a capacity retention rate of over 85% even after 1000 cycles, far exceeding existing materials. His research has shortened the development cycle of new materials and provided important theoretical support for enhancing the performance of electric vehicle batteries.

Wang Chunyang emphasizes that scientific research should not overly rely on equipment but should focus on the scientific issues themselves. His research achievements demonstrate this point, offering new perspectives and methods for the field of materials science.

  alt="AI Method Accelerates Material Thermal Property Predictions"
/>

MIT researchers have developed a new AI method to predict material thermal properties, specifically how heat moves via phonons, subatomic particles. This prediction is crucial for designing efficient power systems, as 70% of global energy ends up as waste heat.

The challenge lies in predicting the phonon dispersion relation, which maps the energy and momentum of phonons in a crystal structure. Traditional methods, whether AI or non-AI, are slow and computationally intensive.

The new method, a Virtual Node Graph Neural Network (VGNN), introduces flexible virtual nodes to represent phonons. This approach speeds up predictions by up to 1000 times compared to other AI methods and 100 million times versus traditional methods.

VGNN simplifies complex calculations by using virtual nodes, allowing quick estimation of phonon dispersion relations. It can predict these relations for thousands of materials in seconds on a personal computer.

This efficiency opens new possibilities for discovering materials with specific thermal properties, such as superior heat storage or superconductivity. The method also has potential applications in predicting other challenging properties like optics and magnetism.

Overall, VGNN represents a significant advancement in material science, leveraging AI to tackle complex physical properties more efficiently.

  alt="NASA's AI Rover Aims to Uncover Ancient Life on Mars"
/>

NASA's "Perseverance" rover on Mars employs AI to analyze rocks. The PIXL instrument, part of the rover, scans rock surfaces using X-rays to map mineral chemistry. This aids in identifying conditions that may have supported ancient microbial life.

AI within PIXL facilitates autonomous decision-making, minimizing the need for human intervention. It adjusts the instrument's position to within micrometers, compensating for mechanical changes induced by temperature. Once positioned, PIXL emits thousands of X-ray beams, forming a grid of mineral data points.

This technology enables real-time analysis, identifying minerals such as carbonates and phosphates. Carbonates suggest water's involvement in rock formation, while phosphates might indicate past microbial life.

The AI system also evolves and improves, focusing on a broader range of minerals over time. This adaptability is crucial as future missions will experience longer communication delays.

"Perseverance" is not alone; the "Curiosity" rover uses similar AI to target rocks with lasers, analyzing the resulting gas to understand rock chemistry. Both rovers benefit from reduced human oversight, allowing for more efficient data collection.

Overall, AI on Mars represents a significant advancement in smarter space exploration, capable of making decisions without constant human direction. This autonomy is essential for missions venturing deeper into the solar system.
