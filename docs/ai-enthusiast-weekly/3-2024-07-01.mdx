### AI Outperforms in Introductory Courses, Faces Challenges in Advanced Studies

Scarfe, at the University of Reading, tested AI's impact on exams. His team used ChatGPT-4 to generate answers for psychology modules. 63 AI-made submissions slipped into the system, 94% undetected. Nearly 84% scored better than human students.

The AI excelled in intro-level courses but faltered in advanced modules. Detectors flagged AI submissions not for being robotic, but for being too good.

Scarfe argues universities should adapt. AI is here to stay, and students should learn to use it. The future of education might blend human and AI skills.

### AI-Generated Game Characters Enhance Player Interaction and Research

  alt="AI-Generated Game Characters Enhance Player Interaction and Research"
/>

Game companies are utilizing large language models to generate characters that not only have detailed backgrounds but can also interact with players in multiple ways. This technology enables non-player characters (NPCs) in games to engage in continuous, unscripted, and non-repetitive dialogues.

Neuroscientists and psychologists have long used games as tools to study human psychology. For instance, the game "Ocean Hero Quest" helps research the loss of navigation abilities in early Alzheimer's patients by observing players' navigation behaviors in a virtual ocean.

The advantage of using games for research lies in people's willingness to participate without requiring payment, allowing researchers to conduct large-scale studies with smaller budgets. Professor Spiers has collected data from over 4 million people across 195 countries.

The integration of artificial intelligence allows researchers to create a rich, immersive world, aiding them in studying how the brain responds to various social environments and how humans interact with others. By observing interactions between players and AI characters, scientists can gain deeper insights into the nature of cooperation and competition.

Additionally, AI game characters can help us understand relationships with virtual companions, which are becoming increasingly common. Professor Spiers finds the study of these relationships inherently fascinating.

### Accelerated Testing Method for Autonomous Vehicles Promises Safer Deployment

<img

  alt="Accelerated Testing Method for Autonomous Vehicles Promises Safer Deployment"
/>

The dream of autonomous driving has been long-held, but the path to commercialization remains distant. The core challenge lies in the inefficiency of safety testing. A team led by Professor Feng Shuo of Tsinghua University and Professor Liu Xiang-Hong of the University of Michigan has proposed the theory of "equivalent acceleration testing for autonomous vehicles," which significantly increases testing speed by 1,000 to 100,000 times.

This method, based on dense reinforcement learning, generates intelligent test environments, overcoming the limitations of fragmented scene testing. Nature has praised this research as a "critical advancement in ensuring the safety of autonomous driving."

Autonomous vehicles need to accumulate over 10 billion kilometers of testing in natural environments to ensure safety. Currently, companies like Waymo are far from meeting this standard in both real-world and simulation testing.

Feng Shuo points out that the low tolerance for safety-critical systems is a key obstacle to the development of autonomous driving. They propose an "AI Against AI" testing method, which efficiently tests autonomous vehicles in virtual environments.

Additionally, the research team has addressed the "sparsity catastrophe" with three solutions: dense learning of safety-critical data, improving model generalization and inference capabilities, and reducing safety risks through vehicle-road collaboration.

Feng Shuo states that these technical routes complement each other and may collectively drive the large-scale commercialization of autonomous driving to levels above L4 in the future.
