U.S. trade curbs on chip exports to China hit Asian stocks hard. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world's largest chip supplier, saw shares drop 4.3% before recovering slightly. Suppliers like Tokyo Electron and Screen Holdings also suffered significant losses.

The Biden administration's potential clampdown on chipmaking equipment exports to China escalates tensions between the two superpowers. This move impacts global chip companies, crucial in our digitized world.

South Korean chip stocks, including Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, also tumbled. Despite short-term volatility, long-term investors see potential in AI advancements.

The Foreign Direct Product Rule (FDPR) allows U.S. control over foreign products using minimal American technology, affecting non-U.S. companies.

Wall Street's tech giants, like ASML and Nvidia, faced substantial losses. ASML, despite strong earnings, closed 12% lower.

Former U.S. President Trump criticized Taiwan, suggesting it should pay for U.S. defense and accusing it of monopolizing America's chip business.

  alt="Gaza Conflict Fuels Fears of IS and Al-Qaida Resurgence"
/>

The Gaza conflict fuels fears of IS and al-Qaida resurgence. Security experts warn of increased extremism due to ongoing violence.

Israel's attacks on Gaza, particularly the Maghazi refugee camp, have left widespread devastation. This chaos is seen as fertile ground for extremist groups like Islamic State (IS) and al-Qaida to rebuild and recruit.

Recent months have seen heightened activity from IS branches in Sinai and Syria, and thwarted plots in Jordan. Turkey has also arrested dozens linked to an IS affiliate. Al-Qaida in Yemen (AQAP) is actively targeting Western and Israeli interests.

The conflict in Gaza is a major factor, but economic crises and civil unrest also contribute. The UN reports that extremist groups are exploiting the situation to attract new recruits and incite lone actors globally.

Television and internet coverage of Gaza's suffering intensifies radicalization. Analysts note a new wave of extremism driven by public disillusionment and poor socio-economic conditions.

IS and al-Qaida are leveraging the anger and despair to mobilize followers and plan attacks. The threat is real and growing, with potential impacts far beyond the Middle East.

Xiaohongshu, known as the "little red book," began in 2013 as an app for shopping tips. Today, it has evolved into a lifestyle guide with over 300 million users, predominantly young women. Users depend on it for daily advice ranging from dining to travel.

The app's core strength is its community and sophisticated algorithm. It curates content tailored to individual interests, often impressing users with its accuracy. This personalization aids lesser-known brands in gaining visibility through targeted marketing.

Xiaohongshu's algorithm also promotes content from less prominent users, striving for a balanced community. More users are increasingly relying on its search function, with 70% conducting searches monthly.

Unlike Douyin, which has a global version (TikTok), Xiaohongshu remains unified, appealing to the global Chinese community. Its user base is primarily Chinese, though international usage is on the rise.

The app's success is rooted in its community-driven approach and advanced algorithm, making it an essential daily tool for many.

## Economy

### Impact of Rising U.S.-China Trade Tensions on Global Markets

U.S.-China trade tensions are escalating. The Biden administration is tightening regulations on chip exports to China and increasing tariffs on Chinese goods. If reelected, Trump plans to impose even higher tariffs.

JPMorgan views China's utilities sector as a potential beneficiary amid these tensions. Historically, during previous trade conflicts, utilities have outperformed the broader market by an average of 12.8%.

Europe could encounter challenges. Goldman Sachs forecasts that Trump's proposed 10% tariff could decrease the euro area's GDP by one percentage point, affecting European stocks' earnings-per-share by six to seven percentage points.

Defensive stocks, such as utilities and healthcare, might gain from rising trade risks. Cyclical stocks, including autos and industrials, could be adversely impacted.

Global chip stocks, including ASML, Nvidia, and TSMC, faced setbacks due to potential trade restrictions. This could hinder mega tech earnings growth, but any significant sell-off might offer buying opportunities.

Hollywood's love for de-aging technology is growing. Scorsese used it with De Niro in The Irishman, and Ford in Indiana Jones also employed it. Now, Zemeckis is tackling Tom Hanks and Robin Wright in Here.

Zemeckis, known for Back to the Future and Forrest Gump, utilizes AI from Metaphysic Live. This technology creates younger versions of Hanks and Wright, seamlessly and in real-time.

The trailer for Here shows Hanks looking youthful, reminiscent of his Big days. The film, set in a single house with a fixed camera, spans the characters' lives.

De-aging technology often falls into the "uncanny valley," appearing not quite human. Zemeckis aims to avoid this by meticulously blending technology with traditional makeup.

The AI models Hanks and Wright using decades of footage, overlaying younger versions onto the current actors based on their expressions. The result is a mirror through time.

Zemeckis is optimistic, believing the technology enhances storytelling by showing what is unseen in real life. If successful, Here could change how Hollywood uses de-aging technology.

The UK Covid inquiry, launched in June 2022 by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, aims to scrutinize government actions during the pandemic. Chaired by Baroness Hallett, the inquiry began public hearings in June 2023. It has the power to compel evidence but cannot assign guilt.

The first report, released recently, criticizes the UK's pandemic preparations, stating they were flawed, leading to unnecessary deaths and economic damage. The UK planned for a mild pandemic, not the severe one that unfolded. This miscalculation resulted in untested lockdown policies.

Baroness Hallett emphasized the need for urgent reforms in emergency planning. She aims to implement many changes within six months to a year. The inquiry will continue to explore various aspects of the pandemic response, from political decisions to vaccine distribution.

The inquiry's findings could reshape how the UK handles future national emergencies.

### Gut Protein's Potential Role in Protecting Brain Cells from Parkinson's

Gut protein, a new hero in the fight against Parkinson's disease, shows promise in shielding brain cells from damage. This protein, found in the intestines, might also play a crucial role in the brain, protecting neurons—the cells that control movement and coordination—from the ravages of Parkinson's.

Parkinson's disease, a neurological disorder, gradually steals motor skills and other functions as it destroys neurons in the brain. The discovery of this gut protein's potential protective role offers a fresh angle in the battle against this debilitating condition.

Research into this protein could lead to new treatments, possibly even preventative measures, for Parkinson's. The hope is that by bolstering this natural defense, we can slow or halt the disease's progression.

This discovery underscores the intricate connections between the gut and the brain, a relationship often dubbed the "gut-brain axis." Understanding these links could revolutionize how we approach neurological disorders, moving away from reactive treatments to proactive strategies.

The journey from this initial finding to practical applications in patient care will be long and complex. Yet, the potential benefits for millions of Parkinson's sufferers make this research a compelling frontier in medical science.

### Canadian HIV Research Network Expands to Combat Rising STIs

Syphilis rates in Canada have doubled. HIV diagnoses jumped 25% from 2021 to 2022. Congenital syphilis, passed from mother to child, surged 599% from 2018 to 2022.

Dr. Marina Klein, from McGill University Health Centre, calls this an "explosion" of infections. The COVID-19 pandemic reduced testing and treatment. Other factors include immigration and access barriers like stigma and sparse health services.

The Pan-Canadian HIV/AIDS Clinical Trials Network, funded with $25 million, expands its focus to all sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections. They aim to find new treatments and preventions, especially for marginalized groups like Indigenous people in western Canada.

Klein emphasizes the need for long-acting therapies that reduce frequent visits to health professionals. The network will support researchers across Canada, leveraging its extensive experience in HIV/AIDS studies to conduct more and better trials.

Infections can emerge suddenly, like mpox. Klein warns against complacency, stressing the need for ongoing vigilance and research.
