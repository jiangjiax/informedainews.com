Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and ex-Marine Paul Whelan, both unjustly imprisoned in Russia, were released in a multinational prisoner swap. Along with them, Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva and British-Russian activist Vladimir Kara-Murza also gained freedom.

President Biden declared all four had been unjustly imprisoned. The swap involved 24 prisoners, including five Germans and seven Russians, all flown to Turkey. Eight Russians, including spy Vadim Krasikov, were returned to Russia from various countries.

Biden praised the diplomatic feat, noting 16 people were released from Russia, including political prisoners. White House national security advisor Jake Sullivan called the exchange historic, highlighting its complexity and the number of countries involved.

Gershkovich and Whelan, both sentenced to 16 years on espionage charges, were greeted by Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris upon their return to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland.

## Politics

### Elon Musk's PAC Utilizes Voter Data to Support Trump in 2024 Election

Elon Musk's America PAC is using voter data to boost Trump's 2024 campaign against Harris. The PAC, backed by Musk's billions and social media influence, targets battleground states with digital ads. These ads entice voters with promises of registration assistance, but instead collect personal data.

In non-competitive states, users are directed to actual registration pages. In battleground states, they encounter detailed data collection forms, only to land on a "thank you" page, unregistered but with abundant data collected.

The PAC's strategy includes door-to-door canvassing, informed by the collected data. This tactic, considered a person-to-person exchange, allows legal coordination with the Trump campaign.

Since June, America PAC has spent over $21 million on various campaign activities. The group's recent leadership shake-up suggests potential strategy changes as November approaches.

Musk's involvement, combined with his tech empire, positions him as a significant player in this election. His PAC's tactics highlight a sophisticated mix of technology and traditional campaigning, aiming to influence the electoral landscape in Trump's favor.

Kamala Harris secured the Democratic nomination for president, making history as the first Black woman and South Asian to lead a major party ticket. Jaime Harrison, chair of the Democratic National Committee, confirmed her majority of delegate votes. Harris will officially accept the nomination at the party's convention in Chicago from August 19 to 22.

Joe Biden, who initially held the presumptive nomination, ended his bid following a poor debate performance. He endorsed Harris, calling her selection as his vice-president "one of the best decisions I’ve made."

Harris's campaign raised $310 million last month, with two-thirds from first-time donors. This surge was partly driven by women and young voters.

Republicans nominated Donald Trump for a third term, with JD Vance as his running mate. Harris is expected to announce her own running mate next week, after a rapid vetting process. Potential contenders include governors and senators from various states.

The speed at which the Democratic party rallied behind Harris was described as "unprecedented." The party aims to unite and demonstrate its strength at the upcoming convention.

Researchers at Washington University in St. Louis have developed a new antibiotic compound, GmPcides, effective against severe bacterial infections in mice, including those that cause "flesh-eating" diseases. This compound targets Gram-positive bacteria, known for causing drug-resistant infections and toxic shock syndrome.

The compound, based on a molecule called cyclo-2-pyridone, was initially designed to prevent bacterial adhesion to urinary catheters. However, it unexpectedly showed broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. GmPcides work by disrupting bacterial cell membranes, making them permeable and impairing their functions.

Tests on mice with necrotizing soft tissue infections, including necrotizing fasciitis, showed significant improvements in healing and reduced bacterial virulence. Importantly, GmPcides appear resistant to the development of bacterial resistance.

The inventors have patented the compound and licensed it to QureTech Bio, aiming for clinical trials and eventual market release. This interdisciplinary approach, combining microbiology, chemistry, and medicine, highlights a promising strategy to combat multi-drug resistant bacteria.

Scientists at the University of Bath have discovered a new method to observe hidden energy states in molecules by utilizing light particles. This groundbreaking development, as outlined in a recent study, has the potential to influence various sectors including pharmaceuticals, security, forensics, environmental science, art conservation, and medicine.

The method employs a phenomenon known as "hyper-Raman," wherein two light particles interact with a molecule and merge, altering their color. The resulting color change, when captured, discloses the molecule's energy state. Hyper-Raman outperforms conventional Raman scattering by penetrating deeper into tissues with reduced damage and enhanced image clarity.

A significant finding was the use of chiral light—light with a twist—to unveil the three-dimensional structure of molecules. This was accomplished by positioning molecules on minuscule gold nanospikes, which function as antennas, concentrating light onto the molecules and amplifying the hyper-Raman signal.

This technique could transform the way we analyze pharmaceutical ingredients, detect environmental contaminants, authenticate artwork, and even diagnose diseases by identifying molecular alterations. The research, spanning several decades, highlights the extensive process from theoretical concepts to practical scientific applications.

### Neglected Disease FGS Affects Millions of Women in Agony

Peninah Kitsao, a Kenyan farmer, endured a year of agony before learning she had female genital schistosomiasis (FGS). This affliction, caused by minuscule parasitic worms in water sources, impacts an estimated 56 million women across sub-Saharan Africa. FGS can lead to organ damage, infertility, and heightened risk of HIV.

Symptoms of FGS closely resemble those of sexually transmitted infections, often resulting in incorrect diagnoses. There is no standardized testing procedure, and only 15,000 women in areas prone to the disease have been tested. A new alliance, the FGS Integration Group (Fig), is working to incorporate FGS treatment into sexual and reproductive health initiatives.

Kitsao's diagnosis was made by a physician trained by LVCT Health, a Kenyan nonprofit organization dedicated to raising awareness about FGS. LVCT discovered that 11% of the women they screened were afflicted with FGS. Gynecologist Victoria Gamba is training medical teams to identify FGS, stressing the importance of precise information and diagnostic methods.

FGS can be treated with praziquantel, a medication that eradicates parasitic worms. However, its efficacy diminishes with delayed detection. The low demand for praziquantel reflects the low rate of diagnoses. Kitsao now collects water with caution, mindful of the potential dangers.

The article underscores the critical need for heightened awareness and standardized testing for FGS to mitigate long-term health consequences and enhance the quality of life for women in affected areas.

## Food

### Ultraprocessed Foods Linked to Increased Dementia Risk

Eating processed red meat, such as hot dogs and bacon, twice a week can increase the risk of dementia by 14%. This conclusion is drawn from a study that tracked 130,000 U.S. adults over 43 years. Unprocessed red meat, like steak, did not significantly raise the risk. However, consuming it daily resulted in greater self-reported cognitive decline.

Ultraprocessed foods, which are high in daily calories, are associated with faster cognitive decline, particularly in executive functions. A Brazilian study supports this, involving over 10,000 middle-aged adults.

Executive functioning refers to higher-order cognitive skills, such as planning and problem-solving.

Japan's food exports dipped 1.8% in the first half of 2024, totaling 701.3 billion yen. This marks the first decline in four years, largely due to a 43.8% drop in exports to China. China banned Japanese seafood imports in August 2023, reacting to the release of treated wastewater from Fukushima.

Exports to the U.S. surged 19.9%, reaching 115.6 billion yen, positioning it as the top export destination for the year. Meanwhile, shipments to Hong Kong fell 10.5%.

Despite the setback with China, exports to other regions, excluding China and Hong Kong, rose 14.3%. This growth was fueled by increased demand in the U.S. and Europe, and a favorable exchange rate.
