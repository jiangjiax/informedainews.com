Recent research shows significant drops in chlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), which are harmful to the ozone layer and climate. This progress, ahead of predictions, stems from the Montreal Protocol, agreed upon in 1987, which controls the production and use of ozone-depleting substances (ODS).

HCFCs, once common in refrigerators and aerosols, are being phased out globally, scheduled for full elimination by 2040. They're being replaced by ozone-safe compounds.

Measurements at Switzerland's Jungfraujoch research station confirm these reductions. The study, led by Bristol University and published in Nature Climate Change, marks a milestone in ozone protection efforts.

Stefan Reimann, an Empa scientist, highlights the success of international agreements and precise atmospheric measurements. These efforts not only protect the ozone layer but also mitigate global warming.

Luke Western, the study's lead author, emphasizes the importance of international treaties like the Montreal Protocol. This agreement not only addresses ozone depletion but also aids in combating climate change.

The research underscores the effectiveness of global cooperation and continuous monitoring in environmental protection. It's a clear victory for proactive environmental policies.

Trump's team seeks to leverage a recent Supreme Court ruling granting former presidents immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts. They petitioned Judge Aileen Cannon to dismiss charges related to Trump's handling of classified documents, arguing these acts are protected by immunity.

The Supreme Court's ruling categorizes presidential actions into three groups: those with absolute immunity, presumptive immunity, and no immunity. Trump's lawyers aim to apply this framework to his case, potentially delaying proceedings significantly.

Additionally, they challenge the appointment of Special Counsel Jack Smith, claiming improper authorization by Attorney General Merrick Garland. This dispute adds another layer to the legal complexities, with Justice Clarence Thomas suggesting lower courts should clarify the special counsel's appointment authority.

This maneuver by Trump's legal team underscores the strategic use of legal precedents to challenge and potentially dismantle ongoing prosecutions. The case highlights the intricate interplay between immunity, presidential actions, and the legal mechanisms governing high-level criminal investigations.

### China-Cuba Spy Base Expansion Raises U.S. Concerns

The Wall Street Journal reported on new findings from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a Washington-based think tank. CSIS analyzed satellite images showing Cuba's expansion of electronic eavesdropping stations. These stations are suspected to be linked to China, particularly a new construction site near the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay.

U.S. officials believe Cuba and China are jointly operating these stations, which could intercept sensitive electronic communications from American military bases and space-launch facilities. The CSIS report identifies four key sites: Bejucal, El Salao, Wajay, and Calabazar. These sites are active and their missions are evolving.

The facilities could monitor U.S. satellite communications and potentially intercept data. They might also track rocket launches from Cape Canaveral and NASA's Kennedy Space Center, including SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets. This information is valuable for China as it competes with U.S. space technology advancements.

**Explanation of Terms:**
- **Electronic eavesdropping stations:** Facilities designed to intercept and record electronic communications, often for intelligence purposes.
- **Satellite imagery:** Photographs taken from satellites orbiting the Earth, used for surveillance and analysis.
- **Space-tracking capabilities:** Technologies and systems used to monitor and analyze activities in space, such as satellite movements.

### AI Startups Attract Massive Funding Despite Market Downturn

Investors have funneled $27.1 billion into AI startups in the U.S. from April to June, representing nearly half of all startup funding during that period. Total U.S. startup funding reached $56 billion, a 57% increase from the previous year. AI startups are flourishing despite a broader startup slump that started in early 2022.

The downturn led to many unprofitable tech startups either cutting costs, selling off, or shutting down. Increasing interest rates steered investors towards safer investments. Startups trimmed their workforce and scaled down their ambitions. However, in late 2022, OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot ignited a new AI surge. Generative AI technology, capable of producing text, images, and videos, spurred the creation and funding of startups.

AI startups invest more in computing costs than non-AI software companies. Kruze Consulting revealed that AI startups allocated 22% of their expenses to computing in the first quarter of the year, more than double the 10% spent by non-AI companies.

Notable startups that received substantial funding include CoreWeave ($1.1 billion), ScaleAI ($1 billion), and Elon Musk's xAI ($6 billion). Investors are optimistic about AI's potential, forecasting that its market could exceed those of the smartphone, personal computer, social media, and the internet.

### AI Tool QDyeFinder Assists in Mapping the Brain Neuron Atlas

Kyushu University has developed QDyeFinder, an AI tool designed to map the neural circuitry of the brain. This tool uses seven colors to label neurons and employs machine learning to automatically identify and reconstruct neuron structures.

The brain is complex, consisting of hundreds of billions of neurons, each connected to others via axons and dendrites. These structures are extremely fine, measuring only one micrometer thick, which is a hundred times thinner than a human hair.

Traditional methods involve using fluorescent proteins to mark neurons and tracing colors to reconstruct neuron structures. However, these methods are limited by the number of colors available and require manual tracing, which is inefficient.

QDyeFinder addresses these issues. It automatically identifies segments of axons and dendrites, groups them using color information, and identifies parts of the same neuron. Results show that its accuracy is comparable to, or even better than, manual tracing.

The research team hopes that QDyeFinder will advance the mapping of brain connectivity and explore its applications in other cell types such as cancer cells and immune cells.

Professor Takeshi Imai concludes that this work is an important step towards understanding the complexity of the brain, although a complete understanding may still take time.

### Ransomware Attack Disrupts London Hospitals, Impacting Cancer Patient

Johanna Groothuizen, a 36-year-old cancer patient, faced a brutal choice after a ransomware attack on London hospitals. The attack disrupted Synnovis, a pathology services provider, leading to the cancellation of over 1,500 medical procedures.

Hanna, diagnosed with aggressive HER2-positive breast cancer, was scheduled for a skin-sparing mastectomy with immediate reconstruction. Due to the attack, she had to choose between a simple mastectomy or delaying surgery. With Synnovis unable to support blood transfusions, the hospital deemed reconstruction too risky.

Faced with this, Hanna opted for the simple mastectomy, losing her right breast. The attack also depleted blood reserves, necessitating urgent blood donations.

Five weeks on, services are still disrupted, with 4,913 acute outpatient appointments and 1,391 elective procedures postponed. Hanna's ordeal highlights the devastating impact of cyberattacks on healthcare.

COVID-19 can affect your mental clarity. About 10%-30% of people experience "brain fog"—difficulties with concentration and memory. Scientists have identified a protein, IL-1β, as a key factor in this issue. It's part of your immune response, but excessive amounts can be detrimental to your brain health.

Researchers, including Dr. Robyn Klein from Western University, investigated how this protein impacts the brain. They utilized rat models to observe the effects of COVID-19 infection. The findings revealed that high levels of IL-1β can impair the brain's ability to generate new neurons and lead to forgetfulness.

However, there is optimism. Vaccines appear to be beneficial. They reduce brain inflammation and lower IL-1β levels, potentially shielding vaccinated individuals from severe cognitive problems.

Klein emphasizes that further research is necessary. The vaccines tested in the study differ from those currently available. Nonetheless, the main message is clear: vaccines decrease inflammation, which could result in less persistent brain fog.

**IL-1β (Interleukin-1β):** A protein that helps regulate your immune system. In high amounts, it can cause inflammation, which is linked to cognitive problems.

Gardenias, a flower that used to cost three to five yuan per jin, has seen its price skyrocket to 35 or 37 yuan per jin this year. New-style tea brands like Nayuki, Tea King, and Ancient Tea have all launched gardenia-infused beverages, which have seen a rapid surge in sales. Gardenia tea drinks, with their unique cool fragrance and refreshing taste, have become a new favorite in the market.

The popularity of gardenias reflects the tea drink market's pursuit of the "chasing fragrance" trend. Floral tea brands utilize olfactory memory to help consumers form brand memories more quickly. The production of gardenia tea drinks employs the flower-infusion technique, where tea and flowers are combined, blending the floral aroma with the tea scent, thereby enhancing the product's added value.

The popularity of gardenia tea drinks has driven a surge in raw material prices and also promoted the upgrade of the entire industry. Tea brands have differentiated themselves through innovation, tapping into unique varieties and cultural potential, achieving cultural dissemination among the youth. The sudden popularity of gardenias is the result of innovation by new tea brands, signaling the continued vitality of the new tea market.
