Lebanon braces for heightened violence after a series of explosive attacks targeting Hezbollah's communication devices. At least 37 dead, 3,000 injured. Hezbollah blames Israel; Israel remains silent.

Lebanon's Economy Minister Amin Salam warns of a perilous 48 hours ahead. Hezbollah, already engaged in daily skirmishes with Israel, vows retaliation, raising fears of all-out war.

The attacks, initially seen as targeting Hezbollah, have unified Lebanon against a common threat. Salam notes a "massive reaction" even among those normally opposed to Hezbollah.

Health Minister Firas Abiad details the strain on hospitals, with 2,800 casualties and 12 fatalities. Lebanon's fragile infrastructure and economy face further strain.

U.S. officials seek a diplomatic solution. Israel moves troops north, signaling a shift in focus from Gaza. Lebanon's government remains committed to avoiding war, but the escalation complicates diplomatic efforts.

### China's arable land area has increased for three consecutive years, with a net increase of 17.58 million mu.

The Ministry of Natural Resources announced that the national arable land area has increased for three consecutive years, with a net increase of 17.58 million mu. By reforming the arable land occupation and compensation balance system and implementing protection responsibility mechanisms, the trend of continuous arable land reduction has been successfully reversed. Notably, in 2023, southern provinces saw a net increase of 7.39 million mu of arable land, altering the "south reduction, north increase" situation, which is crucial for alleviating the pressure of "north grain to south" transportation.

**Explanation:**
- **Arable land occupation and compensation balance system**: Refers to the requirement that when arable land is used for non-agricultural construction, an equivalent quantity and quality of arable land must be replenished.
- **North grain to south**: Refers to the phenomenon of grain from the north being transported to the south, typically due to reduced arable land in the south.

### California Enacts Eight AI Laws to Address Deepfakes and Election Integrity

California’s Governor Gavin Newsom has signed eight AI-related laws, addressing issues from deepfake nudes to AI-generated political ads.

Two laws, SB 926 and SB 981, target deepfake nudes. SB 926 makes it illegal to blackmail with AI-generated nude images, while SB 981 mandates social media platforms to report and remove such content.

SB 942 requires AI-generated content to be disclosed in metadata, aiding public identification.

Three laws focus on election integrity. AB 2655 demands large platforms remove or label election-related deepfakes. AB 2839 criminalizes posting deceptive AI content about elections. AB 2355 mandates disclosures for AI-generated political ads.

Two laws protect actors. AB 2602 requires studios to gain actors’ consent for AI replicas. AB 1836 prohibits digital replicas of deceased performers without estate consent.

Newsom still has 30 AI bills to consider, including the contentious SB 1047. He emphasizes balancing real and hypothetical AI risks.

**Insights:**
California’s proactive stance on AI regulation is crucial. Addressing deepfakes and AI replicas safeguards individuals and elections. However, balancing innovation and regulation is challenging. Newsom’s approach, focusing on solvable issues, is pragmatic.

  alt="FTC Report Exposes Extensive User Surveillance by Social Media and Online Video Firms"
/>

The FTC report reveals that major social media and online video firms—Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, Discord, Reddit, Amazon, Snap, TikTok, and Twitter/X—conduct extensive surveillance on users. Between January 2019 and December 2020, these companies collected vast amounts of personal data, including age, gender, income, and marital status. This information was shared with third parties for targeted advertising.

Users have limited control over data collection. Most firms feed personal information into automated systems for content and ad delivery. Few offer comprehensive opt-out options. Notably, none provided a full list of data recipients to the FTC.

The report criticizes data-minimization practices as inadequate. Some companies failed to delete data upon user request, even when required by law. The FTC recommends federal privacy regulations to address these issues.

Discord and Google disputed the findings. Discord claims its model differs, emphasizing user privacy controls. Google asserts strict privacy policies, prohibiting ad personalization for minors and "made for kids" content.

The FTC's report underscores the need for stronger privacy protections. It highlights the disconnect between corporate claims and actual data practices, urging legislative action to ensure user data is handled responsibly.

  alt="Potential Union Strike at New York/New Jersey Port Raises Concerns for Global Supply Chains"
/>

The Port of New York/New Jersey is preparing for a potential strike by the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA), the largest union in North America, representing over 85,000 longshoremen. A strike would halt five of the 10 busiest ports in North America and 36 ports along the East and Gulf Coasts, impacting 43%-49% of U.S. imports and billions in trade monthly. Cruise operations would continue.

Talks between the ILA and the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX) broke down over the summer, with no clear progress. The ILA recently voted unanimously to authorize a strike, and USMX believes the union has already decided to strike.

Port director Beth Rooney announced that ocean carriers and terminal operators are ramping down operations to avoid container pile-ups. Some carriers have embargoed export cargo from the Midwest to the East Coast. If a strike occurs, vessels will either wait offshore or slow steam to delay arrival. The Coast Guard will manage vessel flow post-strike.

147 vessels, carrying 686,181 twenty-foot equivalent container units (TEUs) valued at $34.3 billion, are en route to East Coast and Gulf ports by October 1. The strike could disrupt supply chains globally, particularly in Europe, Oceania, Latin America, and Asia.

The Biden administration will not invoke the Taft-Hartley Act to force union members back to work, urging both parties to return to negotiations. ILA President Harold Daggett warned that forced return would lead to deliberate slowdown, exacerbating supply chain issues.

Other ports, like Houston and Georgia, have posted strike contingency plans, including extended gate hours and weekend operations. The stalemate between ILA and USMX centers on wages and automation, with talks suspended over an automated gate system in Mobile, Alabama.

Logistics experts report an exodus of cargo from the East to West Coast in anticipation of a strike. The Port of Long Beach, California, is prepared to handle increased cargo if the East and Gulf Coast ports shut down.

### EU Forces Apple to Open iOS Ecosystem to Third-Party Devices and Developers

The European Commission has initiated proceedings against Apple, aiming to force the tech giant to open up its iOS ecosystem to third-party devices and developers. This move is part of the Digital Markets Act (DMA), an EU regulation designed to promote competition and ensure fair access to Big Tech platforms.

The first proceeding targets iOS's connectivity with non-Apple wearables like smartwatches and headphones. The EU wants Apple to enhance interoperability, improving features such as notifications and device pairing.

The second proceeding focuses on Apple's restrictions on third-party developers. The Commission demands that Apple make its request process for integrating features like Siri and Apple Pay more transparent and accessible.

Apple has six months to comply; failure could result in a 10 percent fine of its global annual revenue. This isn't the first time EU regulations have impacted Apple; the company was previously forced to allow third-party app stores and switch to USB-C charging cables.

While these changes initially affect EU users, broader implications for Apple's global operations are likely. The EU's push for openness and competition could set a precedent, influencing Apple's strategies worldwide.

### Beijing eliminates the distinction between ordinary and non-ordinary residential properties, optimizing real estate policies.

Beijing has optimized its real estate policies by eliminating the distinction between ordinary and non-ordinary residential properties. This move aims to streamline the home-buying process, provide more favorable policies, and meet residents' demand for quality housing. Additionally, the city is increasing the construction and supply of affordable housing to ensure that the rigid housing needs of the working class are met. The policy adjustments also include optimizing the rules for commercial residential land transactions, reforming the financing methods for real estate development, and revising the商品房预售制度 (pre-sale system for commercial housing).

**Explanation:**
- **Ordinary and Non-Ordinary Residential Properties**: Under the original policy, residential properties were classified as ordinary or non-ordinary based on factors such as size and price, with different policy treatments. The elimination of this distinction means that all residential properties will now be subject to the same policy framework.
- **Affordable Housing**: Government-provided housing options like economic适用房 (economically affordable housing) and廉租房 (low-rent housing) for low-income families, aimed at ensuring basic living needs are met.

Yang Tao, a graduate in experimental art, organized an anti-domestic violence social fire parade in a rural area of Guanzhong, Shaanxi Province. She invited villagers to act out scenes of domestic violence, recreating violent images from news reports. The parade was titled "Beaten Wives, Kneaded Dough," inspired by a local saying that suggests wives become more obedient with beating, just as dough becomes smoother with kneading.

Yang Tao used flower-shaped steamed buns and social fire performances to artistically present the issue of domestic violence. She selected seven news stories on domestic violence, recreated the scenes with flower-shaped steamed buns, and invited villagers to play the roles of "seven couples," applying "domestic violence makeup" for the parade. During the performance, villagers gathered to watch, creating a chaotic yet impactful scene.

Yang Tao's actions sparked heated discussions online, with many people sharing their own experiences of domestic violence. She hopes that through art, more people will pay attention to the issue of domestic violence.

**Flower-shaped Steamed Buns**: A traditional Shaanxi pastry often used in festive celebrations, characterized by diverse shapes and vibrant colors.

**Social Fire**: A traditional folk performance in Shaanxi, Gansu, and other regions, typically held during festivals or celebrations, featuring mythological stories or historical legends.

Yang Tao's initiative is not just artistic creation but also social intervention. She exposed the harsh reality of domestic violence in a direct and powerful manner, raising public awareness. This combination of art and social issues showcases the power and responsibility of art.

Extending breastfeeding beyond three months significantly reduces the risk of asthma in children. This protective effect is mediated through the maturation of the infant's gut and nasal microbiome, orchestrated by breast milk.

Breast milk contains complex sugars known as human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), which promote the growth of beneficial microbes. These microbes, in turn, help digest HMOs, creating a symbiotic relationship that supports immune and respiratory health.

Early weaning disrupts this microbial balance, leading to the premature introduction of bacteria like Ruminococcus gnavus. This bacterium is linked to increased asthma risk, as it influences immune responses.

The study, published in *Cell*, tracked infants from birth to one year, analyzing their microbiome dynamics and breastfeeding patterns. It found that prolonged breastfeeding, even when accounting for other environmental factors, was a crucial determinant of microbial health.

Machine learning models trained on this data can predict asthma years in advance, highlighting the profound impact of breastfeeding on long-term health.

This research underscores the importance of breastfeeding in shaping a child's microbiome and immune system. It provides a scientific basis for public health guidelines, aiming to protect infants from asthma through optimal breastfeeding practices.

A new blood test, which analyzes lipids, could identify children at risk of type two diabetes, liver, and heart disease. Researchers at King’s College London believe this test could serve as an early warning system.

Traditionally, lipids were viewed as simply good or bad cholesterol. Now, scientists believe there are thousands of lipid types, each with unique functions. This test employs mass spectrometry to evaluate these diverse lipids.

In a study involving 1,300 obese children, 200 underwent a year-long lifestyle intervention. Despite minimal changes in BMI, lipid levels associated with diabetes risk, insulin resistance, and blood pressure decreased.

Dr. Cristina Legido-Quigley, the lead researcher, states that this test could revolutionize disease risk assessment. Future research will investigate genetic influences on lipids and how to modify them for improved health.

**Key Terms:**
- **Lipids:** Fatty substances in the body.
- **Mass Spectrometry:** A technique to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of ions, used here to identify different lipids.
- **BMI (Body Mass Index):** A measure of body fat based on height and weight.

NIST researchers have developed a new infrared microscopy technique that can image biological molecules within living cells. This advancement overcomes the previous challenge posed by water, which strongly absorbs infrared radiation, obscuring other cellular components.

The method, called Solvent Absorption Compensation (SAC), uses optical elements to counteract water's absorption effects. This allows for the clear imaging of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids over a 12-hour period. SAC-IR is faster and more convenient than traditional methods, which often require large synchrotron facilities.

SAC-IR is also label-free, meaning it doesn't require dyes or fluorescent markers that can harm cells and yield inconsistent results across labs. This technique can measure the absolute mass of key biomolecules, aiding in the standardization of cellular analysis methods.

Potential applications include evaluating the safety and efficacy of cell therapies, drug discovery, and understanding cellular responses to medications. Future developments aim to enhance the precision of measuring DNA, RNA, and other critical biomolecules, potentially improving cell preservation techniques.

**Key Terms:**
- Synchrotron: A type of particle accelerator used for high-intensity X-ray experiments.
- Label-free: A method that doesn't require additional markers or dyes to visualize samples.

The U.S. health system ranks last among 10 wealthy nations, despite high costs. A Commonwealth Fund report highlights poor performance in equity, access, and outcomes. Dr. Joseph Betancourt, president of the Commonwealth Fund, sees daily human tolls: patients unable to afford medications, older patients sicker due to lack of insurance.

Healthcare costs dominate voter concerns, yet major reforms are absent from political agendas. Democratic and Republican nominees offer little change. Voters prioritize cost issues: drugs, doctors, and insurance. Americans spend over $13,000 per person annually on healthcare.

The report, part of the "Mirror, Mirror" series, compares the U.S. to Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the UK, Sweden, and Switzerland. The U.S. ranks poorly across all sectors except care process.

Reginald D. Williams II, vice-president of the fund, notes that other nations address social issues better, reducing strain on health systems. Recommendations include expanding insurance, reducing patient expenses, simplifying insurance plans, strengthening primary care, and investing in social well-being.

Dr. David Blumenthal, past president of the fund, acknowledges the challenge of changing the social contract. The upcoming election will shape the direction of U.S. healthcare.

### WNBA Stars' Modest Salaries Amidst Growing Popularity

The WNBA is booming, driven by stars like Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. Attendance, viewership, and merchandise sales are breaking records. Yet, top players earn modest salaries—Clark and Reese make around $76,000 and $74,000, respectively.

Valuations of the three most valuable teams—Las Vegas Aces, Seattle Storm, and New York Liberty—have soared 13 to 70 times their recent sale prices. A new 11-year, $2.2 billion media rights deal with Disney, Amazon Prime, and NBCUniversal kicks in 2026.

Despite this growth, WNBA players still earn far less than NBA counterparts. Brionna Jones, a seven-year veteran, makes $212,000, close to MVP winners A'ja Wilson and Breanna Stewart. Many players, like Jones, play overseas to supplement income.

The current collective bargaining agreement (CBA) runs through 2027, with an opt-out option in November. The league and players' union could renegotiate in 2025. WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert aims to boost player salaries, despite projected losses of $50 million this year.

The league has already invested $75 million from investors, adding charter flights and increasing playoff bonuses. While WNBA salaries lag behind men's sports, many believe it's just a matter of time before they catch up.

### Global Seafood Trade Poised for Record Growth in 2023

The global seafood trade is set to break records this year, potentially surpassing the $195 billion mark set in 2022. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) predicts a rebound driven by new supply chains and increased consumption in major markets like China.

One key factor in this growth is the reduction of production losses—currently around 30% due to improper storage and processing. The FAO aims to halve these losses by 2030, which could feed tens of millions more people with essential protein.

Technological advancements, such as economical freezing and rapid processing, are crucial. They not only reduce waste but also cut inefficient costs, boosting market development.

Illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing (IUU) has also declined, thanks to strengthened regional controls. This reduction in illegal fishing helps preserve bio-resources and supports sustainable growth.

In summary, the seafood trade is poised for a significant upswing, driven by technological improvements, reduced waste, and better regulation. These factors collectively ensure a more secure and efficient global food supply.

Since Brexit, the UK has allowed higher levels of pesticide residues on over 100 food items, from potatoes to avocados. Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs) for pesticides like chlorantraniliprole and boscalid in tea have surged by 4,000 times. Glyphosate, deemed a "probable human carcinogen" by the World Health Organization, now has a 7.5 times higher MRL for beans.

MRLs are meant to safeguard public health and the environment. Critics argue that the new, weaker MRLs expose consumers to reproductive toxins and carcinogens. Northern Ireland retains the stricter EU standards.

The changes occurred between 2022 and 2024 under the previous Conservative government, replacing EU-derived regulations. The EU has not weakened its MRLs; in some cases, they've tightened.

Pesticides Action Network UK (Pan UK) analyzed data from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), revealing that MRLs for 49 pesticides were weakened, including 15 on a list of "highly hazardous pesticides." For instance, MRLs for avocados and pomegranates for the insecticide bifenthrin, a hormone disruptor, were raised 50 times.

Pan UK's Nick Mole stated, "Safety limits have been undermined for a worrying list of pesticides." The HSE maintains that decisions are based on scientific risk assessments, ensuring safety.

The UK adopted weaker MRLs from the Codex Alimentarius, a UN-backed set of international food standards often criticized for being less stringent than EU counterparts due to corporate lobbying. The UK only adopted Codex standards that offered lower protection.

Mole urged the new government to reverse these changes, emphasizing the need for a precautionary approach prioritizing health and environment. The HSE and Defra assert that MRL decisions are rigorously assessed for public safety.
