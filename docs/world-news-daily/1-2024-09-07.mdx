# World News Daily(2024-09-07) : OpenAI CEO Leads Multi-Billion Dollar AI Infrastructure Initiative

## OpenAI CEO Leads Multi-Billion Dollar AI Infrastructure Initiative

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is spearheading a multi-billion dollar initiative to bolster AI infrastructure across the U.S. and allied nations. The plan involves constructing data centers, enhancing energy production and transmission, and expanding semiconductor manufacturing. Altman argues that physical infrastructure, from data centers to power plants, is crucial for AI's growth.

OpenAI is courting global investors, including those from Canada, Korea, Japan, and the UAE. Microsoft, a key investor, is also potentially involved. The project aims to attract foreign capital to the U.S., countering concerns about national security. OpenAI is engaging with the U.S. National Security Council to navigate these issues.

Altman is also considering a new company to focus on green energy for AI chip manufacturing. Potential partners include chipmakers like TSMC, Intel, and Samsung. OpenAI is eyeing TSMC's advanced 1.6-nanometer process for AI chip production, aligning with the U.S.’s CHIPS and Science Act, which provides $390 billion for semiconductor manufacturing.

This initiative underscores the AI industry's need for robust infrastructure and America's strategic role in global AI competition.

### Judge Postpones Trump Hush-Money Sentencing Until After Election

A New York judge, Juan Merchan, postponed Donald Trump’s sentencing on hush-money charges until November 26. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, requested the delay to avoid sentencing before the election. His lawyers argued there was insufficient time for appeals, citing a recent Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity.

Merchan recognized the complexities, noting that the election and the ruling made a timely sentencing challenging. Prosecutors did not object to the delay, seeing it as a sign of support. Trump faces up to four years in prison but could receive a lesser sentence or probation.

The trial was contentious. Trump’s attacks on Merchan and others led to a gag order. The delay means voters won’t see the sentence before casting their ballots. Democrats would use it to highlight Trump’s unfitness; Republicans would portray it as political persecution.

Legal analyst Katie Phang criticized the delay, suggesting it fuels doubts about the case’s integrity.

### U.S. Charges Russian Military Hackers for Cyberattacks on Ukraine and NATO

The U.S. Department of Justice indicted five Russian GRU officers and a civilian for cyberattacks on Ukraine, a U.S. agency in Maryland, and 26 NATO countries. The accused, led by GRU colonel Yuriy Denisov, allegedly orchestrated the WhisperGate attack, disguised as ransomware but intended to destroy data.

The group met at Cafe Shokoladnitsa in Moscow, planning their operations. The U.S. government claims significant access to their infrastructure, sending a clear message to the GRU: "We are onto you."

Targets included Ukraine's Ministry of Internal Affairs, State Treasury, and railways, as well as a Central European country's transportation network. The U.S. declined to name the Maryland-based agency hit.

The FBI, CISA, and international partners issued a cybersecurity advisory and offered $10 million rewards for information leading to the hackers' arrest. The U.S. government referred to the hackers as having "baby faces," a stark contrast to their destructive actions.

**Explanation:**
- **GRU:** Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate, a military intelligence agency.
- **WhisperGate:** A cyberattack designed to look like ransomware but aimed at destroying data.
- **CISA:** Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, a U.S. government agency focused on cybersecurity.

  alt="Economic crime suspect Xiang Mouhua has been repatriated to China, with the amount involved exceeding 20 billion yuan."

Xiang Mouhua, an economic crime suspect, colluded with others to defraud over 20 billion yuan through illegal fundraising and went on the run for four years, traveling through multiple countries. Recently, with the efforts of the "Fox Hunt" task force, Xiang Mouhua was extradited back to China from abroad. This marks the capture of the last major suspect in a significant illegal fundraising case in Dalian.

In 2021, the Dalian Municipal Public Security Bureau received a report alleging that a technology group had defrauded tens of millions of yuan. An investigation revealed that from 2015 to 2021, Xiang Mouhua and Wang某某 fabricated investment projects, defrauding over 36,000 people nationwide with an involved amount exceeding 20 billion yuan. Wang某某 has been sentenced to life imprisonment, while Xiang Mouhua fled overseas in 2020.

Under the command of the Ministry of Public Security's "Fox Hunt Office," the Liaoning public security economic investigation department established a task force to pursue the fugitive abroad. Over the past four years, Xiang Mouhua repeatedly evaded capture before finally being apprehended and extradited to China. At the extradition site, Xiang Mouhua stated, "The days in a foreign land were extremely difficult, and upon returning home, I will actively cooperate with the investigation."

This operation is another successful example of deepened law enforcement cooperation between China and relevant countries, demonstrating the Chinese police's determination to pursue economic crime suspects who have fled abroad. As of now, the "Fox Hunt 2024" special operation has captured nearly 800 overseas economic crime suspects from over 50 countries.

### The 2024 China-Africa Cooperation Forum Summit concludes: China-Africa relations elevated to a new era of all-weather community with a shared future.

The 2024 China-Africa Cooperation Forum Summit concluded in Beijing after a three-day session, with leaders from over 50 African countries in attendance. Chinese and African leaders unanimously agreed to elevate China-Africa relations to a "new era of all-weather China-Africa community with a shared future." Since the establishment of the forum in 1999, China-Africa relations have evolved from a "new type of partnership" to a "comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership."

President Xi Jinping emphasized at the opening ceremony that China-Africa relations are at their best historical moment. UN Secretary-General António Guterres hailed China-Africa relations as a driver of South-South cooperation, highlighting the vitality of African economies and the potential of Chinese support.

The summit adopted two important documents: the "Beijing Declaration on Building a New Era of All-Weather China-Africa Community with a Shared Future" and the "Beijing Action Plan for China-Africa Cooperation Forum (2025-2027)." President Xi announced that China will provide 360 billion RMB in support for China-Africa cooperation over the next three years, including 210 billion RMB in credit and 80 billion RMB in various forms of aid.

During the summit, President Xi held bilateral talks with several African leaders, elevating bilateral relations with multiple countries to strategic partnership or comprehensive strategic partnership levels.

Four high-level meetings focused on the four topics of "governance," "industrialization and agricultural modernization," "peace and security," and "high-quality joint construction of the Belt and Road," reflecting the common concerns of China and Africa regarding modernization.

China-Africa cooperation has achieved significant results in agriculture, peace, and security. Hybrid rice technology has helped increase rice production in several African countries, alleviating food shortages. China and Africa are jointly advancing the modernization of peace and security, contributing to world peace and development.

The summit yielded abundant results, and the prospects for China-Africa cooperation are vast.

### Microsoft Partners with StopNCII to Combat Deepfake Porn on Bing

Microsoft has partnered with StopNCII to combat deepfake porn on Bing. StopNCII allows victims to create a digital fingerprint, or "hash," of explicit images. This hash is then used to scrub the images from partner platforms. Bing joins Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and others in this effort.

Microsoft’s pilot removed 268,000 explicit images from Bing search results. Previously, user reporting was insufficient. Google, however, faces criticism for not partnering with StopNCII. In South Korea, Google users reported 170,000 links of unwanted sexual content since 2020.

Deepfake porn is widespread, affecting even minors. StopNCII’s tools are limited to adults. The U.S. lacks a federal law on AI deepfake porn, relying on state laws instead. San Francisco sued 16 "undressing" sites in August. Twenty-three states have passed laws against nonconsensual deepfakes, while nine have rejected proposals.

  alt="Alibaba's Hong Kong Listing Upgrade to Attract Mainland Investments"
/>

Alibaba's upgrade to a primary listing in Hong Kong is expected to attract billions from mainland China. The move makes Alibaba eligible for Stock Connect, a program that allows cross-border trading between Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Shenzhen.

Morgan Stanley estimates that $12 billion could flow into Alibaba within six months, boosting its market capitalization by 6%. This comes as Alibaba seeks new investors after SoftBank, its former top shareholder, significantly reduced its stake.

Mainland investors are flocking to Hong Kong due to poor performance in the mainland market and a weakening yuan. Stock Connect saw a record $59.2 billion in net purchases from January to August, double the previous year.

International investors are pulling out of mainland China, selling a net $945 million worth of equities this year. This marks the first time in history that annual net outflows might occur.

The Shanghai Composite Index is at a seven-month low, trading below 2,800, down 10% since May. Meanwhile, Hong Kong's market has declined by just over 3%.

The Hang Seng Stock Connect China AH Premium Index shows that Hong Kong stocks are nearly 50% undervalued compared to their mainland counterparts. This disparity attracts mainland investors.

Chinese authorities are concerned about capital outflows, withholding some transaction data and promoting optimistic economic views. This has led to suspicions of hidden bad news, delaying market recovery.

Funds leaving China are finding homes in Japan and India. Alibaba's inclusion in Stock Connect could further drive mainland investment into these markets, potentially freeing up $3.2 billion for international investments.

South Korea is tightening electric vehicle (EV) battery safety standards following recent fires that have sparked public concern. A Mercedes-Benz EV battery exploded in a Seoul garage in August, forcing hundreds to evacuate. In June, a fire at a lithium battery plant killed 23 workers.

Bang Ki-sun, the government's policy coordinator, announced new measures to prevent such incidents. EV manufacturers must now disclose battery suppliers and materials. A certification system for battery safety will begin in October.

The government is urging EV manufacturers to install battery monitoring systems. It is also promoting the use of solid-state batteries, which are considered safer than lithium-ion cells. To prevent overcharging fires, South Korea aims to increase the number of digital-controlled chargers from 20,000 in 2024 to 91,000 by 2025.

Firefighting efforts are also being enhanced. Parking garages will receive more sprinklers, fire alarms, and fire-retardant covers. The government plans to develop driverless fire trucks using military technology.

South Korea, home to EV giants like Hyundai and LG Energy, views the industry as crucial for economic growth. These new regulations aim to protect both the industry and public safety.

Touts are scalping Oasis reunion tour tickets, listing over 4,500 on resale sites like Viagogo, StubHub, and Gigsberg. These tickets, originally bought in breach of gig rules, are now priced in the thousands. The band has threatened to cancel any tickets bought through such platforms.

Dynamic pricing by Ticketmaster, which hiked ticket prices by hundreds of pounds, has sparked outrage and a competition watchdog investigation. Touts are holding back more tickets, waiting for the Ticketmaster controversy to fade before selling.

Resale isn't illegal, but using unlawful methods—like speculative selling, where tickets are advertised without being owned—can land touts in jail. The Competition and Markets Authority forces resale platforms to reveal traders selling 100+ tickets annually.

Some touts, like Ricardo Junior from Brazil, claim to have dozens of tickets for major shows. Others, like Rojan Rana, admit to speculative selling. Younger touts, known as "sneaker kids," started by cornering the trainer market before moving into tickets.

The government is considering banning ticket resale for profit, mirroring Ireland's approach. The murky world of secondary ticketing, where savvy traders can make thousands per show, raises concerns about illegal practices and exploitation of fans.

Tokyo Gendai, Japan’s nascent international art fair, saw a surge in interest this year. Pace Gallery, a major U.S. player, sold most of its Robert Longo pieces on the first day, surprising CEO Marc Glimcher. Buyers were mainly Japanese, a shift from the past.

The fair showcased works by Yoshitomo Nara, Ai Weiwei, and Hiroshi Senju, among others. It also included children’s workshops, fostering creativity.

Japan’s art market has long been small, accounting for just 1% of the global market. However, leading galleries like Pace, Ceysson and Benetiere, and Perrotin are now setting up in Tokyo, seeing potential.

Pace’s Tokyo gallery, its third in Asia, opened in September. Ceysson and Benetiere will follow in Ginza. Perrotin, with a Tokyo presence since 2017, aims to deepen engagement.

These moves reflect a change in Japan’s art scene. Decades of deflation stifled engagement with the global art world. Now, there’s a renewed interest, driven by young collectors and international galleries.

Glimcher notes the shift: “Artists want to have a show here.” Tokyo’s emergence as an art hub is promising, signaling a vibrant future for Japan’s art market.

### Health Canada Orders Destruction of Old COVID-19 Vaccines Ahead of New Formulations

Health Canada has ordered provinces to destroy existing COVID-19 vaccines targeting the XBB form of Omicron by September 1, 2024. These vaccines, based on a strain discovered in late 2021, are being phased out as new formulations targeting more recent Omicron subvariants, such as JN.1 or KP.2, are expected to be approved soon.

Ontario and other provinces plan to receive the new vaccines in October. British Columbia, however, will keep the old vaccines available until the new ones are approved, especially for those needing immediate vaccination, such as travelers or those visiting immunocompromised relatives.

Doctors and experts agree that while the old XBB vaccines aren't perfect, they still offer some protection. Health officials recommend updated boosters due to the virus's ongoing mutations and waning immunity over time.

Pharmacists in Ontario and Alberta report that the XBB vaccine is no longer available. Some, like Fady Salama in Toronto, were initially skeptical of the directive to discard the vaccines, questioning the logic of getting rid of something still useful.

COVID-19 activity remains high in some regions, with cases, hospitalizations, and deaths continuing to rise, though not at pandemic-peak levels. Dr. Donald Vinh from McGill University Health Centre notes that people are still getting sick, requiring medical attention and delaying other treatments.

Health Canada is expediting reviews of new vaccine submissions from Pfizer, Moderna, and Novavax for the fall campaign. The withdrawal of the old vaccines is part of standard practice, similar to annual influenza vaccines. A federal reserve of XBB vaccines will be maintained for unexpected public health needs.

Marie-Andree Lajoie, an Ottawa resident planning an overseas trip, had her booster appointment canceled, highlighting the transition period's impact on public access to vaccines.

### DRC Receives First Batch of Mpox Vaccines to Combat Outbreak

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has received its first batch of 100,000 mpox vaccines, part of an EU donation. Another 100,000 doses are expected soon. The mpox outbreak, formerly known as monkeypox, is spreading rapidly across Africa, with nearly 25,000 cases reported this year. The DRC accounts for most of these, but cases are rising elsewhere.

Dr. Jean Kaseya, director general of Africa CDC, warns that swift action is needed to halt the spread. He’s particularly concerned about a case in a seven-year-old child in Guinea, possibly the first detection of the new clade Ib variant in west Africa. Clade Ib, a mutated form of the virus, was first detected in eastern DRC and appears to be spreading through close contact.

The WHO and African health officials have declared the outbreak a public health emergency. A response plan is estimated to cost nearly $600 million over six months. While 380,000 doses have been pledged by western partners, officials say 3 million doses are needed to end the outbreak.

Vaccination programs will focus on contacts of suspected cases and healthcare workers. However, the program won’t start until October at the earliest, as local workers are being trained. Most cases in the DRC are among children, and regulators are assessing whether to authorize the vaccine for 12 to 17-year-olds.

Concerns about vaccine affordability persist, with the WHO estimating a cost of $50 to $75 per dose. Dr. Andrew Hill of Liverpool University suggests Bavarian Nordic should lower prices or allow generic production. Bavarian Nordic, however, hasn’t discussed prices with relevant organizations.

The presence of clade Ib in Kinshasa, with its international connections, underscores the need for improved surveillance to control the disease’s spread.

  alt="NFL Team Valuations Surge: Massive Returns for Owners"
/>

NFL teams are now worth an average of $6.5 billion each. Owners have seen returns far exceeding those of traditional stocks. For instance, the Houston Texans, bought for $600 million in 1999, are now valued at $6.35 billion.

The surge in team values is driven by massive media deals. The NFL's current TV agreements, worth $9.2 billion annually, are 85% higher than previous contracts. Streaming deals with YouTube and Amazon Prime add another $3.2 billion yearly.

Revenue sharing ensures all teams benefit equally from national media deals, sponsorships, and gate receipts. This helps small-market teams like the Green Bay Packers and Buffalo Bills compete with larger markets.

However, stadium revenue—from luxury suites, on-site sales, and non-NFL events—remains unshared. This creates a disparity in team values. For example, Taylor Swift's Eras Tour generated $4 million per show for hosting stadiums.

Overall, the NFL's revenue-sharing and salary-cap agreements make it highly profitable. The league's total revenue in 2023 was $20.47 billion, with $13.68 billion shared equally among teams.

### 4,600+ Accounts Penalized for Insulting National Athletes During Paris Olympics

In August 2024, Beijing's network watchdog processed over 1.5 million reports of illegal and harmful online content, a 4% increase from the previous month. During the Paris Olympics, the focus shifted to "sports fandom" issues, where fans' behavior became toxic. Over 4,600 accounts were penalized for attacking and insulting national athletes, with 301,000 harmful posts removed.

One case involved a user inciting hatred and spreading false information about athletes. The platform responded by deleting 92 posts, disbanding three groups, and banning four accounts. Another case saw an elderly person's request for help misrepresented online, leading to personal attacks. The platform swiftly removed the offending content. A third case highlighted a fake app mimicking a legitimate one, aiming to defraud users. The platform acted promptly to clear the misleading information.

The watchdog emphasizes the importance of providing clear evidence when reporting online misconduct. They encourage the public to use their platform to maintain a clean digital environment.

**Key Terms:**
- **"Sports fandom" issues:** Problematic behavior by sports fans, often involving excessive, negative, or obsessive behavior online.
- **"Harmful posts":** Content that violates community standards, such as hate speech, misinformation, or harassment.

### AI-Generated Pizza Recipe Becomes a Hit in Dubai

The AI-generated recipe caters to Dubai's diverse population, including Indians, Pakistanis, Filipinos, Arabs, and Europeans. Despite initial skepticism, the pizza has become a hit. ChatGPT also suggested unconventional combinations like strawberries with pasta and blueberries with cereal, but these were not adopted. The success highlights AI's potential in culinary innovation, even if it challenges traditional chef instincts.

Japan's market for Korean food products has surged 50% over five years, driven by the popularity of Korean pop culture. CJ Foods Japan, a subsidiary of South Korean food maker CJ Cheiljedang, leads with its Bibigo brand, selling mandu dumplings, kimchi, and seasonings. The company introduced seven new frozen products in March, aiming to make Korean cuisine more accessible.

Daesang Japan, another South Korean food giant, entered the market with frozen kimbap in 2021. Sales have grown steadily, prompting plans to expand its product line. The company attributes this success to the exposure of Korean cuisine in dramas, making healthy dishes familiar to Japanese consumers.

The Korean food market in Japan reached 29 billion yen in fiscal 2023, according to Ajinomoto, a Japanese food processor. Ajinomoto itself has revamped its Cook Do Korea seasonings, focusing on authentic flavors that enhance rice dishes. NH Foods, known as Nippon Ham, launched K-Kitchen, a ready-to-eat Korean cuisine brand, in 2023.

South Korea’s government aims to nearly double the global market for Korean food by 2027. With domestic growth limited by falling birthrates, Korean food processors are aggressively expanding internationally.
