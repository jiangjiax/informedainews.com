Jammu and Kashmir, India’s northern region, held its first assembly election in a decade on September 18, 2024. The polls follow the 2019 repeal of the area’s special status by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). This status, unique to Jammu and Kashmir, allowed only local residents to buy property and secure jobs. The region, long a flashpoint between India and Pakistan, saw its autonomy revoked and was split into two federally governed territories: Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.

The election aims to form a local government pressing for regional development and security. Some parties seek restoration of statehood. With 90 seats up for grabs and 8.7 million registered voters, the polls are crucial. The second and third phases of voting are set for September 25 and October 1, with results due on October 8.

Modi, addressing a rally, vowed a “secure and prosperous” Jammu and Kashmir, criticizing past governments for neglecting the people’s needs. The BJP’s popularity in the region has waned since the autonomy repeal, with some observers noting its weak presence in Kashmir.

The election is significant, reflecting ongoing tensions and the complex dynamics of a region central to India’s identity and security.

  alt="Russian Disinformation Group Fabricates Fake Kamala Harris Story"

Russian disinformation group Storm-1516 fabricated a fake hit-and-run story involving Kamala Harris. They created a video, hired an actor, and spread the lie through a bogus San Francisco news site, KBSF-TV.

Microsoft identified Storm-1516 as a Kremlin-aligned troll farm. The false claim, alleging Harris left a 13-year-old girl paralyzed, went viral on social media, viewed over 2.7 million times.

This operation signals Russia's intensified efforts to influence the upcoming US presidential election. Microsoft notes Storm-1516's shift from targeting Biden to Harris after his withdrawal from the race.

Storm-1516 specializes in producing misleading videos featuring actors posing as whistleblowers or journalists. The KBSF-TV website was registered just before publishing the false story.

The US Justice Department recently charged two RT employees with money laundering for hiring an American company to produce election-influencing content.

Russia aims to deepen US political divisions and undermine support for military aid to Ukraine. Harris pledges continued support for Ukraine if elected.

  alt="Israeli Intelligence Operation Targets Hezbollah with Explosive Pagers"
/>

Israel's Mossad planted explosives in 5,000 pagers imported by Hezbollah, leading to a massive explosion that killed nine and wounded nearly 3,000. The pagers, sourced from Taiwan-based Gold Apollo, were actually manufactured by BAC Consulting in Budapest. Gold Apollo denied responsibility, stating BAC had a license to use their brand.

The operation was months in the making, following a series of assassinations of Hezbollah and Hamas leaders. Hezbollah, using pagers to avoid Israeli tracking, unknowingly activated the explosives via a coded message. The Mossad modified the devices at the production level, embedding a board with explosive material.

Hezbollah vowed retaliation, marking this as their biggest security breach since the Gaza conflict. The group had already lost 170 fighters to Israeli strikes. Nasrallah, Hezbollah's leader, warned supporters to secure their phones, highlighting the vulnerability of modern communication.

This incident underscores the high stakes of espionage and the constant evolution of warfare tactics. Hezbollah's reliance on low-tech communication failed to protect them from sophisticated Israeli intelligence operations. The fallout will likely escalate tensions, pushing both sides closer to all-out conflict.

### China's Gradual Retirement Age Increase: A Balanced Approach

  alt="China's Gradual Retirement Age Increase: A Balanced Approach"
/>

China’s recent decision to raise the retirement age is not a knee-jerk reaction but a calculated move. Men will retire at 63, women at 58. These changes roll out gradually over 15 years, affecting those born after specific years.

The strategy is clever. Men born in 1968, a high-birth-year, will work nearly an extra year. Women, especially blue-collar workers who faced hardships, get a longer retirement to enjoy time with family.

This isn’t just about numbers. It’s about balancing economic needs with social equity. The changes benefit those who started working post-Mao, during Deng Xiaoping’s reforms. It acknowledges the struggles of older generations while setting a path for younger, better-educated workers.

For younger generations, a later retirement isn’t a burden but an opportunity. Many, especially educated urban women, might prefer to work longer.

In essence, this policy is a blend of pragmatism and compassion. It extends working lives to sustain economic growth while ensuring older workers get more time to enjoy their later years.

### China's Urban Public Transport Sees Rapid Growth and Green Transition

By 2023, over 80% of China's urban public buses will operate on clean energy. Fifty-four cities will have metro systems, totaling more than 10,000 kilometers in length, serving nearly 200 million daily commuters.

Transportation Deputy Li Yang emphasizes the importance of green transit and prioritizing public transportation for urban modernization. Cities must focus on making transportation more efficient, eco-friendly, and user-friendly.

Recent data shows significant mobility:
- September 16: 190 million cross-region trips
- September 15: 210 million cross-region trips
- September 14: 190 million cross-region trips

These figures highlight the rapid growth and integration of China's urban transit networks.

In Maiduguri, Nigeria, over 200 inmates escaped from a flooded prison. The flood, the worst in two decades, followed the collapse of a dam on September 9. 37 people died, and 200,000 were displaced. The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) reported submerged buildings and widespread chaos.

The Nigerian Correctional Service (NCS) stated that 281 inmates fled during transfer to a safer facility. Seven were recaptured, leaving 274 at large. The flood destroyed prison walls and staff quarters. A joint search with other security agencies is underway.

Wildlife from the Sanda Kyarimi Park zoo, including reptiles and lions, was also displaced into residential areas. Temporary shelters in six camps house the displaced. Maiduguri, once a hub for Boko Haram’s insurgency, saw previous IDP camps closed in recent years.

The United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) warns of acute food insecurity for 31.8 million Nigerians. Aid workers fear worsening conditions and potential disease outbreaks like cholera in crowded camps.

In April, the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency predicted floods across 36 states. The actual impact exceeded forecasts due to climate change. 29 states are affected, with 1.3 million hectares (3.2 million acres) submerged, half of which is cropland.

Vice-President Kashim Shettima acknowledged the severity of the flood, vowing to find lasting solutions. However, infrastructure struggles to cope. Suwaiba Dankabo of Action Aid Nigeria highlighted destroyed road networks complicating aid delivery.

The situation mirrors flooding in Cameroon’s Far North region, where dykes broke, collapsing 3,700 houses. The Benue River, shared by Cameroon and Nigeria, hosts the Lagdo dam, a yearly source of flooding. States like Adamawa, adjacent to Borno, face imminent risk from expected dam discharges.

Microsoft and BlackRock, along with Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) and MGX, have formed the Global Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Investment Partnership (GAIIP). Their goal: raise up to $100 billion to build AI data centers and the energy infrastructure needed to power them.

The initiative aims to gather $30 billion initially, with plans to reach $100 billion through debt financing. This move comes as tech giants scramble to construct data centers equipped with Nvidia GPUs, crucial for running AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT. These GPUs demand significant power, creating a bottleneck for new facilities.

Microsoft's Azure cloud service, which supports OpenAI and other AI clients, requires substantial capital expenditure. In the last quarter, Microsoft's capital spending, including finance leases, totaled $19 billion.

BlackRock's acquisition of GIP, expected to close in October, involves $3 billion in cash and 12 million shares of BlackRock stock. MGX, launched by Abu Dhabi's Mubadala and AI firm G42, is also part of the partnership.

This collaboration underscores the urgent need for robust infrastructure to sustain the explosive growth of AI technologies. The financial commitment reflects a strategic push to ensure AI's widespread integration across various sectors, driving innovation and economic growth.

### Chinese enterprises break the monopoly of core OLED screen technology, driving industrial upgrading.

China's OLED industry, after a decade of pursuit, surpassed South Korea in the first quarter of 2024 to become the global leader in production. OLED technology, with its advantages of high contrast, ultra-thinness, and flexibility, has become the next-generation display technology. However, the core material FMM (Fine Metal Mask) has long been monopolized by Japan's DNP, restricting the development of China's OLED industry.

Xu Huawei's company, Zhongling Technology, has focused on the localization of FMM. After four years of research and development, it has overcome the bottleneck of Invar alloy material and achieved mass production of FMM. In 2023, Zhongling Technology's FMM products passed customer verification, breaking DNP's monopoly and reducing domestic panel manufacturers' reliance on a single supplier.

FMM is a critical mold in OLED production, directly affecting panel quality. DNP implements quality differences for different customers, limiting the high-end product manufacturing capabilities of Chinese panel manufacturers. Zhongling Technology has improved FMM quality through independent research and development of Invar alloy and has applied it to mid-to-high-end products of various terminal brands.

In the future, with the rise of companies like Zhongling Technology, China's OLED industry will break free from technological blockade and embrace broader development opportunities.

QR payments are booming in Southeast Asia, especially in Malaysia and Cambodia. These countries lead the way due to low bank account ownership and limited ATM access, coupled with affordable smartphones.

In Cambodia, QR payments surged 29% in 2023 to 601 million transactions. The National Bank of Cambodia launched Bakong Tourists, a mobile payment system for travelers, promoting the use of the Cambodian riel. With 3.3 million QR payment locations, even small vendors accept QR codes.

Malaysia's DuitNow QR, launched in 2019, saw 1.5 billion transactions in the first half of 2024, totaling 1.37 billion ringgit. It interoperates with other ASEAN systems, making cross-border payments seamless.

Singapore's PayNow, launched in 2017, processed 437 million transactions worth 157 billion Singapore dollars in 2023. It linked with Thailand's PromptPay in 2021, the first international instant payment system linkage. PayNow now supports startups and fintech, with 27 participating banks and companies.

The Bank of Thailand is expanding PromptPay's reach across ASEAN. QR payments are becoming essential infrastructure, facilitating commerce and tourism.

### NASA Awards Intuitive Machines $4.8B Contract for Lunar Communications Infrastructure

NASA aims to establish a permanent human presence on the moon. Currently, astronauts can only communicate with Earth when in direct line of sight. To overcome this, NASA is developing the Near Space Network and has awarded Intuitive Machines a contract worth up to $4.82 billion to build a satellite constellation for lunar communications.

Intuitive Machines, based in Houston, is known for its private moon landing in February, despite a rocky landing. The company offers a rideshare service to the moon but faces limitations in data transmission due to the need for direct line of sight with Earth.

The contract, with a guaranteed $150 million, could extend for ten years. This infrastructure is crucial for NASA's plans to land humans on the moon's south pole by the end of the decade, where direct communication with Earth is limited. Beyond crewed missions, the relay system will enhance uncrewed missions, enabling remote operation of rovers and improved data transmission.

This infrastructure will benefit not only NASA but also private industry, including Intuitive Machines. The company, which went public last year, relies heavily on government contracts and saw a 130% increase in revenue in the second quarter of this year, reaching $41.4 million.

  alt="Douyin's Strategic Shift in Long-Form Content Challenges Bilibili's Dominance"
/>

In late August, a shake-up hit the creators on Xigua Video as ByteDance phased out its "Medium Video Partner Program" after three years, replacing it with Douyin's "Creator Partner Program." This shift unified earnings distribution under Douyin, leading to a reported drop in creator revenue.

The program's inception in 2020 aimed to rival Bilibili by attracting mid-tier creators with revenue shares. By 2021, Xigua was integrated into Douyin's ecosystem, marking a decline in its prominence. Despite initial plans to merge Xigua into Douyin, ByteDance later clarified its commitment to Xigua.

Douyin's ecosystem now hosts long-form content beyond Xigua, evident with the launch of Qingtao (later renamed Douyin Select) and the inclusion of long-form channels within the main app. Notably, Douyin has seen success with ultra-long videos, such as a 7.5-hour video by @Mi Sanhan, positioning itself against Bilibili.

Douyin's strategy focuses on creating content benchmarks to attract more creators and users. While Xigua's role diminishes, Douyin remains committed to long-form content, leveraging its strengths in advertising to support this shift.

The battle for mid-tier creators between Douyin and Bilibili continues, with Douyin's recent initiatives drawing Bilibili's top creators to its platform. This move poses a significant challenge to Bilibili's user growth and content ecosystem.

In summary, Douyin's consolidation of long-form content under its brand signifies a strategic shift, leveraging its advertising prowess to support a new era of long-form video content, directly challenging Bilibili's dominance in this space.

In 2023, a duo on Xiaohongshu, @肚肚小盆友 and @爱肚肚的皮皮, garnered over 2 million followers by playing with "slime"—a gooey, stress-relieving toy. Their videos, featuring large, colorful slimes being stretched and squished, captivated audiences with their satisfying sounds and visuals.

The secret to their success? Engaging content that taps into the growing "stress-relief economy." Videos blend sensory stimulation—sight, sound, and touch—with interactive elements, like fulfilling viewer requests. This creates a loyal fan base eager to see their favorite slimes manipulated in new ways.

The trend extends beyond these two. "Nienie" toys—soft, moldable figures—have also surged in popularity, with millions of views on related Xiaohongshu posts. Influencers like @宋黛cony and @陈胖快乐日记 have capitalized on this, sharing unboxing and crafting videos that resonate with stressed-out viewers.

Is this a lucrative business? Absolutely. Slime and nienie toys are cheap to produce but sell for premium prices, especially when customized. Some sellers report margins as high as 60%, with limited-edition items fetching thousands.

However, the market is crowded with small-scale, often unregulated sellers. Quality varies, and safety concerns linger. Yet, for those adept at social media marketing, the rewards are substantial.

In essence, this niche thrives on creativity, community engagement, and a universal need for relief from modern pressures. It's a testament to how digital platforms can turn simple, soothing pastimes into thriving enterprises.

### BRCA Gene Mutations Linked to Increased Multiple Myeloma Risk

Inherited changes in BRCA genes linked to increased risk of multiple myeloma.

BRCA genes, known for their association with breast and ovarian cancer risk, now show connections to multiple myeloma. This blood cancer develops in the bone marrow and affects plasma cells.

Research suggests that mutations in BRCA genes can increase the risk of myeloma. These mutations, which can be inherited, alter the DNA repair mechanisms. Faulty repair mechanisms can significantly increase the likelihood of cancer development.

Insight:
Understanding the broader impact of BRCA genes enhances cancer awareness. Early detection, which is crucial for myeloma, becomes even more urgent. Genetic counseling and screenings emerge as essential tools in managing this risk.

This connection highlights the complex interplay between genetics and disease. Each discovery brings us closer to personalized treatments and preventive strategies.

Rice is Japan’s soul, as essential as wine to France. Over 500 varieties, each unique, are grown. To older Japanese, a meal without rice isn’t a meal. Rice lore is rich, from family heirlooms to rituals.

Chef Jiro Ono insists perfect sushi starts with perfect rice. At Narita Airport, Chinese tourists smuggle 30-kg bags of Koshihikari, the king of rice. But climate change threatens this staple. Heat and pests strain crops, prompting research for heat-resistant varieties.

Neighborhood rice shops fade as online and supermarket sales rise. Yet, storage capacity is at a 30-year low. This summer, Tokyo supermarkets rationed rice. Historically, rice was currency. Post-WWII, it traded for luxury items.

Today, population decline and hotter summers shrink output. Typhoons empty shelves. Rice imports are minimal, mainly for restaurants. Japanese prefer their own rice.

Experts suggest robots and computers could boost production. But rice’s emotional value complicates this. Digitizing its production might do more harm than good.
