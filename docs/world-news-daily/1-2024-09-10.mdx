The EU’s top court will decide if Apple owes €13bn in back taxes. This case began in 2016 when Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition chief, claimed Apple received unfair tax benefits from Ireland. Due to these benefits, Apple paid a tax rate of 0.005% in 2014. Vestager ordered Ireland to collect the money.

In 2020, a lower EU court sided with Apple, stating that the EU failed to prove Apple gained an unfair advantage. Vestager appealed, and now the highest EU court will make the final ruling.

Vestager’s firm stance on tax agreements made her a pivotal figure in EU competition policy. She is stepping down from her position this year. Not all her decisions have been upheld in court—cases involving Fiat and Amazon were overturned.

A senior court lawyer suggested the 2020 Apple ruling was flawed and should be reconsidered. The final decision could impact how EU countries offer tax deals to multinational corporations.

Fiona Scott Morton, an economist, argues that EU countries should compete on public services rather than tax breaks. She believes if the EU loses this case, new laws to prevent tax competition may be introduced.

  alt="Australian Government Plans to Set Minimum Age for Social Media Access"

The Albanese government plans to set a minimum age for social media and gaming access, with legislation to be introduced before the next election. The exact age remains unspecified, pending the conclusion of an age-verification trial.

Prime Minister Albanese emphasized the rapid pace of technology, acknowledging the government's limitations in protecting children from all threats. He highlighted parental concerns, noting that no previous generation faced this challenge.

A report by former High Court Chief Justice Robert French outlines a legislative framework for a minimum age, with South Australian Premier Peter Malinauskas favoring 14. The federal age could be higher. The draft bill requires parental consent for children aged 14 or 15 and imposes obligations on platforms to prevent underage access.

Malinauskas compared early social media access to harmful products like cigarettes and alcohol, urging government action. Victorian Premier Jacinta Allen also plans to restrict children's access, targeting tech companies for accountability.

National cabinet discussed these issues, with uncertainty over state legislation. An age-verification trial, aimed at preventing underage access to pornography and social media, enters its final phase. Communications Minister Michelle Rowland stressed the importance of platforms contributing to age-appropriate internet use.

Albanese reassured parents, promising action. Opposition leader Peter Dutton supports a 16-year minimum age, pledging implementation within 100 days if elected.

### Pacific Islands Propose Recognizing Ecocide as a Crime at International Criminal Court

Vanuatu, Fiji, and Samoa have proposed to the International Criminal Court (ICC) that ecocide—severe environmental damage—be recognized as a crime. If approved, ecocide would join genocide and war crimes as prosecutable offenses. The proposal defines ecocide as "unlawful or wanton acts" causing substantial, widespread, or long-term environmental harm.

The move faces years of debate and likely opposition, though much will be behind closed doors. Philippe Sands KC, an international lawyer, is confident ecocide will be recognized, though the timing remains uncertain. Belgium has already criminalized ecocide, and other nations are considering similar laws.

Stop Ecocide International has campaigned since 2017 for this change. Vanuatu first called for ecocide recognition in 2019. Even if approved, it could take a decade before any charges are filed. Still, the proposal is crucial for broader acceptance of ecocide as a crime.

**Insights:**
The proposal marks a significant shift in how we value and protect our environment. By elevating environmental harm to a criminal offense, it underscores the gravity of ecological destruction. The journey to recognition will be long and contentious, but the momentum is building. As nations like Belgium take steps to criminalize ecocide, the global consensus on environmental responsibility grows. This proposal is not just about legal recognition; it's about changing the moral and ethical framework within which we operate. It signals a new era where the health of our planet is no longer a secondary concern but a primary one, deserving of the same legal protections as human rights.

### Ocean Cleanup Project Aims to Eradicate Great Pacific Garbage Patch Within a Decade

The Ocean Cleanup, after six years, claims it can eradicate the Great Pacific Garbage Patch within a decade. The patch, twice Texas' size, holds 79,000 metric tons of plastic. A $7.5 billion effort would take ten years; a $4 billion push could halve that time. The group's U-shaped barriers have already removed over a million pounds of trash. Next year, they plan a hiatus to map high-plastic zones for more effective cleanup. The message: ocean cleanup is feasible, affordable, and urgent.

### Draghi Calls for Radical EU Reform to Boost Competitiveness and Climate Goals

Mario Draghi, former Italian Prime Minister and European Central Bank President, calls for radical EU reform. He estimates the bloc needs an extra 800 billion euros annually to meet goals like competitiveness and climate targets.

The EU faces threats from weak economic growth and productivity compared to the U.S. and China. Draghi's report highlights the need for reduced energy prices, boosted competitiveness, and stronger defense investment.

The EU's reliance on external suppliers for critical minerals and other resources is a vulnerability. Draghi suggests developing a "foreign economic policy" to secure supply chains and reduce dependencies.

Full implementation of the single market and reforms in competition policy, especially in tech, are crucial. The EU must also address an "innovation deficit" through reforms.

To mobilize private finance, Draghi recommends transforming the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) into a single regulator, similar to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Overall, the EU needs to increase its investment-to-GDP rate by 5 percentage points annually to meet defense, digitalization, and decarbonization targets. This would require an additional 750 to 800 billion euros yearly.

The report, commissioned by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, aims to trigger a crucial debate. However, political fragmentation among member states makes swift action unlikely.

### Apple Unveils iPhone 16 with Enhanced AI Capabilities

Apple's iPhone 16 represents a significant leap into AI, promising a smarter Siri and dynamic emojis. CEO Tim Cook heralds it as the beginning of a new era. Since Steve Jobs' debut in 2007, iPhones have generated $3 trillion in shareholder wealth, but recent minor upgrades have led to sales declines.

The iPhone 16, designed with AI in mind, aims to reignite consumer excitement. Analysts view it as a pivotal moment, potentially positioning Apple as the gatekeeper of consumer AI. A preview three months ago has already built anticipation.

Apple is partnering with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT, starting with U.S. English next month and expanding to other languages in 2024. The iPhone 16 features the A18 chip, an aluminum back, and a customizable button. Prices range from $1,129 for the base model to $1,749 for the Pro Max.

The Apple Watch Series 10 debuts with a thinner design and larger screen, focusing on health and sports. The rugged Watch Ultra 2 starts at $1,099. New AirPods 4 boast an improved design and acoustics, with hearing aid features pending U.S. approval.

China, a crucial market for Apple, is eager for AI features but faces regulatory challenges. OpenAI's ChatGPT is blocked in China, complicating Siri's AI integration. Apple must navigate these challenges to maintain its dominance.

Competitors like Google are also pushing AI, intensifying competition in the high-end smartphone market. Apple's success hinges on compelling software and overcoming regulatory obstacles in key markets.

The Polaris Dawn mission, funded by billionaire Jared Isaacman, launched on September 10, 2024, from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. A Falcon 9 rocket carried four astronauts into orbit, marking the first commercial spacewalk.

Isaacman, a seasoned pilot, leads the crew, which includes a retired military fighter pilot and two SpaceX employees. The mission aims to reach an altitude of 1,400 km, testing Starlink-laser communications and conducting microgravity research.

Spacewalks, or EVAs (extravehicular activities), have historically been the domain of government agencies. Polaris Dawn's spacewalk, planned for the third day at 435 miles, will be a significant milestone. The Crew Dragon craft lacks an airlock, so the entire cabin will be depressurized, and all four astronauts will wear SpaceX-designed spacesuits.

Elon Musk's SpaceX plans to colonize Mars and has been developing Starship, the largest rocket ever built. Polaris Dawn will also study the effects of space radiation on the crew, crucial for future deep space missions.

Private companies like SpaceX are increasingly leading space exploration, as governments focus on other expenditures. NASA has contracted SpaceX to land astronauts on the moon, including the first woman, by the end of this decade.

Chongqing, China, faced an unusual weather event on September 2, 2024. After a heatwave, authorities used cloud-seeding missiles to induce rain. Instead, a sudden windstorm hit, gusting up to 76mph. The storm scattered laundry from high-rise balconies, creating an "underwear crisis."

Videos of flying pants and bras flooded Douyin and Weibo. Residents joked about emotional damage and romantic encounters. One man, losing his underwear, laughed but vowed to become a lifelong introvert.

Authorities denied the storm was linked to cloud seeding. Zhang Yixuan, Chongqing Weather Modification Office deputy director, called it natural convection. Despite this, the incident cemented a humorous association between bad weather and flying underwear in Chongqing.

Residents now warn each other to secure laundry. A lingerie store employee noted people weren't rushing to replace lost items but expected sales to rise due to the season.

The "underwear crisis" became a viral sensation, with millions viewing and commenting on related hashtags. The event showcased the resilience and humor of Chongqing's residents, turning a bizarre weather incident into a shared, lighthearted memory.

Apollo Quiboloy, a pastor in the Philippines, claimed to be the “appointed son of God.” He led the Kingdom of Jesus Christ (KOJC) church, which boasts millions of members. In 2021, the US Department of Justice charged him with sex trafficking of girls and women aged 12 to 25. These “pastorals” were allegedly forced into sexual relations with him.

Quiboloy went into hiding after a Philippine court ordered his arrest on similar charges. The police launched a two-week manhunt, culminating in his surrender after a 24-hour ultimatum. He was flown to the capital and detained in a heavily guarded facility.

The pastor denies the allegations, blaming critics and former members for fabricating the claims. He faces additional charges of cash smuggling and visa fraud, which allegedly brought church members to the US under false pretenses.

During his flight from justice, Quiboloy demanded a guarantee against “extraordinary rendition”—a US practice of transferring detainees to other countries for interrogation.

Despite the serious allegations, some followers of KOJC have shown support, embracing police officers after Quiboloy’s arrest.

**Extraordinary Rendition**: A controversial practice where a country transfers a detainee to another nation for interrogation, often without legal oversight.

The Chinese Football Association (CFA) has banned 38 players and five club officials for life, following a two-year investigation into match-fixing and gambling. The probe uncovered 120 fixed matches involving 41 clubs. Notable names among the banned include former China internationals Jin Jingdao and Gu Chao, and South Korean midfielder Son Jun-ho.

Son’s agent called the accusations “ridiculous” and plans a press conference to address the matter. Despite the CFA ruling, Son’s current club, Suwon, intends to continue using him unless ordered otherwise.

The investigation led to criminal penalties for 44 individuals, including bribery, gambling, and illegal casino operations. The CFA president, Song Kai, announced life bans for 43 individuals and five-year bans for 17 others.

This crackdown reflects ongoing efforts to cleanse Chinese football of corruption, a problem long blamed for the national team’s underperformance. Recent high-profile cases include a former CFA vice-president sentenced to 11 years for bribery and a former competition department director sentenced to seven years for the same offense.

HANOI — Vietnam’s instant noodle market is booming, led by Japanese producer Acecook. Last year, Acecook sold 3.3 billion servings, capturing 40% of the market. This volume is nearly 60% of Japan’s annual consumption.

Inflation has made instant noodles a popular, affordable meal. Acecook’s Hao Hao brand, priced at around 18 cents per pack, dominates. Higher-priced options, with more ingredients, are also gaining traction.

Acecook plans to expand its production capacity with two new factories by 2027. The company predicts Vietnam’s consumption will hit 10 billion servings by 2030.

Global instant noodle consumption rose 13% from 2019 to 120.2 billion servings in 2023. Southeast Asia accounts for 30% of this, with Vietnam leading at 83 servings per capita.

Masan Consumer, Acecook’s rival, focuses on premium products. Its Omachi brand offers self-boiling hot pots, priced over $4. Masan aims to shift the perception of instant noodles from unhealthy to a “pleasant and delicious” meal.

Southeast Asia drives the global market. Noodle packets are lighter, encouraging more consumption. Local brands like Mama in Thailand and Lucky Me in the Philippines are strong.

Indonesia, the largest market, consumes 14.5 billion servings annually. Indofood, with its Indomie brand, leads. The rural market is expanding as instant noodles become a convenient, cheap meal.

Companies like Acecook and Indofood are accelerating overseas expansion to meet global demand. Vietnam is set to become Acecook’s export hub.
