Blinken, US Secretary of State, concluded his Middle East tour. A ceasefire with Hamas remains elusive. A bridging proposal is on the table, accepted by Israel. Hamas is not directly negotiating and views the proposal as too Israeli-centric.

The proposal includes a six-week ceasefire, the initial release of female, elderly, and sick Israeli hostages, and the possibility of indefinite extension. The second stage involves exchanges of soldiers, Israeli troop withdrawal, and the return of Palestinians.

The key issue is that Hamas demands a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, which Israel rejects. Blinken clarified the US stance against long-term Israeli occupation. Netanyahu hinted at keeping troops in strategic Gaza corridors, but the White House denied this.

Egypt and Qatar are mediating. There is a fear of a wider regional conflict if the truce fails. Recent attacks in Tehran and Beirut, linked to Israel, have prompted Hezbollah and Iran to vow retaliation.

Casualties continue in Gaza. An Israeli airstrike hit a school, killing 10. Israel recovered six hostage bodies in Gaza, with details of their deaths unclear.

*Bridging proposal: A temporary solution aimed at resolving immediate issues while broader negotiations continue.
*Philadelphi corridor: A strategic strip along the Gaza-Egypt border, key to controlling smuggling and movement.

Criminals sell sextortion guides online on platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Telegram. These guides teach how to trick teens into sending intimate photos and then demand money, threatening to share the photos.

A National Crime Agency manager, Adam Priestley, noted that YouTube guides detail every step, from creating fake accounts to targeting victims and profiting. Some guides even instruct targeting secondary schools.

A cybersecurity firm found an 80-page guide on Telegram, offering detailed advice on creating fake profiles, manipulating victims, and choosing the best countries for extortion. The author claims to have exploited 5,000 victims over seven years.

YouTube, TikTok, and Telegram all claim to take strict measures against such content, but the guides remain accessible. This indicates a growing, professionalized crime, with potential for significant profit.

Heat-related deaths in Europe could triple by 2100, with southern countries like Italy, Greece, and Spain bearing the brunt. Currently, cold kills more people, but heat-related deaths are rising faster as populations age.

If global warming reaches 3°C or 4°C, heat-related deaths could surpass those from cold. This could strain public health systems, particularly during heatwaves.

Currently, 44,000 people die from heat each year. This number could jump to 129,000 at 3°C above pre-industrial levels. Even if warming remains at 1.5°C, total deaths from heat and cold could rise from 407,000 to 450,000 by 2100.

The study challenges the notion that fewer cold deaths balance out more heat deaths. It warns of indirect impacts such as crop failures, wildfires, and economic losses.

Heat will increase deaths across Europe, but southern regions will suffer the most. At 3°C warming, an additional 55,000 could die, mostly those over 85.

Predicting temperature-related deaths is complex. Improvements in healthcare and infrastructure might mitigate impacts. However, adapting to rising heat is crucial.

Governments should invest in hospitals, develop action plans, and insulate buildings. Addressing greenhouse gas emissions is key to avoiding worst-case scenarios.

Adaptation efforts should focus on regions with high unemployment, poverty, and aging populations. These areas are more vulnerable to climate impacts.

  alt="Shein Considers Public-First IPO in London"

Shein, a Chinese fast-fashion giant, is considering a London IPO at a valuation of 500 billion pounds. They are contemplating a direct stock sale to the British public, a rare move. Typically, IPOs allocate shares to banks and funds initially, with individuals purchasing later.

Shein's advisors—JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley—are reviewing this public-first strategy. The plan is still in its early stages. Shein filed with the UK's FCA and Chinese regulators in June.

The company is also considering establishing its first UK warehouse, aiming to address tax complaints related to shipping from China. If successful, Shein's IPO would be London's largest, surpassing Glencore's 2011 debut.

Shein's current valuation stands at 660 billion dollars, following a 20 billion dollar fundraising in May. Investors include major funds like General Atlantic, Tiger Global, Sequoia China, and Mubadala.

Direct IPOs to the public have become less common. The UK government's aborted NatWest stock sale highlighted issues with discounted taxpayer-funded deals. However, platforms like Peel Hunt's RetailBook and PrimaryBid have eased the process for retail investors to participate in IPOs.

Shein and its advisors have yet to comment.

Mpox outbreak alarms health experts. A new strain spreads rapidly and is more lethal. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a global emergency. Cases have emerged in unexpected locations such as Sweden, Pakistan, and Thailand. The virus is transmitted through close contact, causing flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions. While typically mild, it can be fatal.

Dr. Hans Kluge of the WHO emphasizes that it is not a new Covid, and can be halted through cooperation. However, experts caution about unknowns, particularly with a new subvariant, clade 1b, which spreads more aggressively, particularly affecting young people and moving through sexual networks. More data is needed to understand and control it.

Clade 1 affects children, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals severely. The outbreak is worsening in countries with poor health systems, high HIV rates, and ongoing conflicts. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) reports over 15,000 cases and 537 deaths. Experts note inadequate controls and unlearned lessons from the previous outbreak.

Bavarian Nordic, the manufacturer of an approved mpox vaccine, may increase production. They are seeking EU approval to use it on teenagers. CEO Paul Chaplin highlights its importance for the current outbreak, with over 70% of cases in Africa occurring in individuals under 18.

### Manitoba Researchers Develop Diabetes-Fighting Vegetables

Researchers at the University of Manitoba, in partnership with the Opaskwayak Cree Nation (OCN), are developing vegetables with enhanced nutritional benefits to combat diabetes. The project utilizes a vertical 'smart farm' established in 2016, which grows plants hydroponically under controlled conditions with LED lights and artificial intelligence.

Initially, the farm provided free vegetables to OCN families through local health programs, aiming to promote healthier diets. Currently, the focus is on research. The team has discovered methods to increase antioxidant compounds in vegetables such as cabbage, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts, which could aid in managing obesity, blood glucose, inflammation, and heart function.

These vegetables are being tested on diabetic and obese rats, with early results indicating higher levels of beneficial compounds compared to store-bought produce. The challenge now is to encourage community members to incorporate these vegetables into their diets, especially since fresh produce is not a regular part of their diet.

To address this, the team is collaborating with chefs at Red River College Polytechnic's Prairie Research Kitchen to develop culturally-sensitive recipes that make the vegetables more accessible and appealing.
