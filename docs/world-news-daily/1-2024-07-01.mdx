US agents, under Trump, campaigned in Germany against Nord Stream 2, a gas pipeline from Russia. Testimonies in a German state parliament session revealed US secret service involvement, aiming to sway environmental groups.

Thomas Krüger, a state parliament chairman, cited witnesses who faced direct approaches from US intelligence, all in the name of "US interests."

The pipeline, completed in 2021, faced hurdles including US sanctions and German certification halts due to political tensions. In 2022, explosions damaged the pipeline, prompting terrorism investigations in both Russia and Germany.

Nord Stream 2, despite its completion, remains a point of contention, entangled in geopolitical struggles and security concerns.

## Politics

### Far-Right National Rally Poised to Dominate French Politics

The far-right National Rally (RN) is on track to become France's largest party in the National Assembly. This surge marks a significant shift in French politics, with RN now the dominant force. The upcoming second round of voting on July 7th will determine if RN secures an outright majority, giving them a free hand in government, or if they face constraints due to a split Assembly.

Current projections suggest RN could win between 260 and 310 seats, with 289 needed for a majority. To counter this, President Emmanuel Macron’s centrists and the left-wing New Popular Front are urging tactical voting. However, the effectiveness of such strategies is uncertain, as public adherence to party orders diminishes.

The high voter turnout has led to many "triangular votes"—constituencies with three candidates from the center, far-right, and left. This complicates efforts to consolidate anti-RN votes. The nation seems resigned to a far-right victory, a shift that has left many in urban areas, particularly Paris, disheartened.

Sudan teeters on the brink of a famine "beyond imagination," warns Martin Griffiths, outgoing UN aid chief. Over 750,000 Sudanese face imminent starvation, with conditions poised to worsen.

Griffiths compares Sudan's plight to the historic Ethiopian famine, which claimed 1 million lives from 1983 to 1985. He notes Sudan's crisis lacks the global attention and funding that Ethiopia received. The 2024 Sudan humanitarian plan, seeking $2.7 billion, is less than 17% funded.

In Gaza, 495,000 face catastrophic conditions, though numbers have halved since March. Griffiths highlights the effectiveness of aid, yet warns improvements may be fleeting.

Sudan's civil war leaders, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, obstruct aid access. The Darfur region, central to the famine, is blocked from receiving aid via Chad. Diplomatic efforts to resolve this stalemate are ongoing but urgent.

Griffiths emphasizes the critical need for aid to avert the looming disaster. Time is short, and the world's response remains inadequate.

### France's Snap Election: A Shift in Political Landscape

France is on the brink of a snap election, triggered by President Macron's party's defeat to the far-right National Rally in the recent European Parliament votes. The initial round is scheduled for June 30, followed by a second round on July 7. Polls indicate that National Rally, led by Jordan Bardella and Marine Le Pen, is likely to take the lead with approximately 35% support, while Macron's centrist Together alliance is trailing at 19%.

Macron's decision to call for early elections is aimed at defining France's political trajectory and securing a stable majority. Nonetheless, analysts view this as a high-stakes gamble, relying on public apprehension of a far-right administration to sway votes away from National Rally.

Should National Rally achieve a robust result, Macron might be compelled to appoint a prime minister from the party, potentially Bardella. This situation could lead to a cohabitation period, merging conflicting ideologies and possibly resulting in a contentious government.

Financial markets have responded negatively to the election's uncertainty, with French stocks underperforming and bond yields fluctuating. Political analysts anticipate a difficult negotiation phase following the election, as parties seek coalitions to establish a majority government.

In essence, France is confronting a critical election that could dramatically alter its political scenery, with economic and political stability at stake.

MIT researchers have developed a model to predict ice flow based on microscopic flaws in ice. This model reveals how these tiny defects influence glacier movement and, consequently, sea level rise.

Traditionally, ice sheets were seen as monolithic. However, this new model shows they respond variably to warming. It focuses on two microscopic mechanisms: "dislocation creep" and "grain boundary sliding." These mechanisms determine how ice deforms under stress.

The model uses data like environmental temperature and ice crystal size to estimate which mechanism dominates in different areas. This helps predict where ice is more likely to flow and melt into the sea.

Comparing the model's predictions with actual ice flow data from Antarctica shows good agreement. This suggests the model can accurately forecast future ice movement and sea level rise.

This research is crucial as it provides a more nuanced understanding of how ice sheets respond to climate change. It helps refine predictions of catastrophic sea level rise, aiding in preparedness and mitigation efforts.

### Green Hydrogen: A New Hope for Heavy Vehicle Fuel

In Corpus Christi, Texas, a plant converts water into "green" hydrogen using renewable energy. This hydrogen is then chemically transformed into diesel for heavy vehicles. This development is significant—it could revolutionize how planes, ships, trains, and trucks obtain their fuel.

Batteries are too heavy for aircraft and too bulky for ships. Long-haul trucks and certain rail lines face challenges with electrification. These vehicles account for about half of transportation emissions.

Infinium, the owner of the plant, produces hydrogen-based fuels aiming for net zero emissions. While this is a promising start, these fuels are currently expensive and scarce. Billions of dollars are being invested in this technology by the U.S. government, businesses, and philanthropists such as Bill Gates.

The critical factor is dedicated renewable energy. Without it, hydrogen fuels could generate more pollution than regular diesel. Texas's energy grid is only 40% renewable, with the remainder coming from natural gas and coal. This mix powers the Infinium plant.

Infinium creates chemical replicas of existing fuels by combining captured carbon with green hydrogen. A truck operating on this diesel would produce 89% fewer greenhouse gases than one using petroleum diesel.

The future may see heavy vehicles transition to pure hydrogen fuel cells, which emit only water vapor. However, for now, we need these chemical replicas to gradually reduce our dependence on oil.

### Global Undersea Cable Project to Transfer Renewable Energy

Entrepreneurs are planning a massive undersea cable project. Six cables, each over 2,000 miles long, would span the Atlantic, connecting Europe and North America with the aim of transmitting 6 gigawatts of renewable energy. This is equivalent to the power output of six nuclear plants, moving energy at the speed of light.

The concept is to harness the sun's daily cycle. When Europe is sunny and has excess power, it would send this energy west to the U.S. Later, when the sun is over America, Europe would receive the energy back. It's a simple exchange.

This is not just a fantasy. Similar projects are emerging globally. Europe already connects with its neighbors via sea cables. The UK links with Belgium, Norway, the Netherlands, and Denmark. They are also considering a solar and wind link with Morocco.

Australia plans to send solar power to Singapore. India and Saudi Arabia aim to connect via the Arabian Sea. These cables are not just about energy; they are reshaping geopolitics, shifting power struggles to the ocean depths.

### U.S. Utilities Warn of Impending Power Crisis Due to Surging Data Center Demand

U.S. utilities warn of a looming power crisis. Electricity demand, stagnant for over a decade, is set to surge by 2030. Driven by AI, chip manufacturing, and electric vehicles, this spike threatens economic stability.

Data centers alone will add 290 terawatt hours to U.S. power needs. This is equivalent to Turkey's entire electricity consumption. Tech giants like Amazon and Google are racing to secure power for new data centers, some requiring as much as a gigawatt—the output of a nuclear reactor.

NextEra Energy, the nation's largest renewable power company, forecasts a 38% rise in U.S. power demand by 2040. They plan to meet this with renewables and battery storage. Southern Company, another major utility, also sees historic demand growth, driven by data centers and population expansion.

Both companies emphasize the need for a balanced energy mix. While renewables are crucial, nuclear and natural gas will play key roles in ensuring reliability. The message is clear: to sustain economic growth, the U.S. must get its energy strategy right.

Epic Games has submitted its store and an updated Fortnite app to Apple for notarization. This move follows the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which compels Apple to relax its restrictions on third-party developers. Apple maintains the authority to ensure that these applications meet its stringent security and privacy standards.

Epic, along with other companies such as Spotify, has been critical of Apple's strict requirements. The EU is currently investigating Apple's policies regarding alternative app stores and its Core Technology Fee (CTF). The CTF imposes a charge of 0.5 Euros per installation after the initial million, with no exemptions granted for free apps. Third-party app stores are also subject to this fee for every download, with no exceptions for the first million units.

Apple contends that the CTF is necessary to cover the expenses associated with utilizing its technology and notarization services, which are essential for validating apps for Apple platforms. Developers and owners of alternative app stores, such as Riley Testut's AltStore, have voiced their opposition to this fee to the EU.

Eisai, a Japanese pharmaceutical company, is developing a new Alzheimer's drug that targets tau proteins, which are associated with brain cell damage. Although the trials are currently small, they show promising results. Developing drugs that target tau proteins is challenging, but they have the potential to significantly alter the treatment landscape for Alzheimer's disease.

Alzheimer's disease begins with the accumulation of amyloid proteins in the brain, followed by tau proteins, which lead to neuron breakdown. The role of tau proteins is direct, impacting cognitive functions. While removing tau proteins is complex, recent research has illuminated how they spread, prompting new efforts in drug development.

Eisai's drug aims to trap tau proteins before they spread. Successful animal tests have been conducted, and now human trials are underway. The competition is intense, with major U.S. companies like Biogen and Johnson & Johnson also vying for a breakthrough.

Eisai already has lecanemab, an approved Alzheimer's treatment that targets amyloid proteins. They plan to combine it with the new tau drug for enhanced efficacy. Lecanemab has received fast-track approval in both the U.S. and Japan.

Haruo Naito, CEO of Eisai, is optimistic about the potential of a tau drug, stating, "A tau drug could be the next step towards a cure." Alzheimer's affects over 55 million people worldwide, and Eisai is aiming for substantial sales with lecanemab and its new tau drug.

Gilead Sciences recently announced that its HIV drug lenacapavir, in phase III trials, demonstrated 100% efficacy among 2,134 cisgender women with no cases of infection. Lenacapavir is an injectable capsid inhibitor designed to impede the assembly of the virus's protein shell and has been approved in the United States for HIV treatment, requiring combination with other antiviral drugs.

The drug has shown excellent performance in preventing HIV infection, with Gilead's CEO calling it a new tool for HIV prevention. However, lenacapavir faces multiple challenges in ending HIV transmission: a large global population of HIV-infected individuals, high costs of preventive medications, and the virus's strong mutation capabilities.

Despite these challenges, lenacapavir's long-acting properties (requiring only two injections per year) bring hope to HIV patients, potentially alleviating the psychological burden of daily medication, improving mental health, and reducing HIV transmission.

Gilead has a long history in antiviral research, having previously launched a hepatitis C drug that increased cure rates to nearly 100% and contributed to a shrinking market size. The success of lenacapavir not only boosted Gilead's stock price but also added another achievement to its efforts in HIV prevention and treatment.

Overall, while lenacapavir brings new hope to HIV prevention and treatment, completely ending the HIV epidemic will require further research and efforts.
