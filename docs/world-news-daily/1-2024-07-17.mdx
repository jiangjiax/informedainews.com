55 years ago, NASA launched Apollo 11, marking the first manned moon landing. On July 16, 1969, at 9:32 AM, the mission blasted off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The crew, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins, spent eight days in space. Armstrong and Aldrin walked on the moon, while Collins orbited above.

The mission used a Saturn V rocket, a three-stage behemoth. After launch, the first two stages detached, and the third propelled the craft into Earth's orbit. Half an hour later, the lunar module separated, beginning its journey to the moon.

Armstrong, the mission commander, became the first man on the moon. Initially, there was debate within NASA about who would step onto the lunar surface first. Armstrong's role as commander sealed the decision.

Following Apollo 11, NASA conducted five more successful lunar missions. Apollo 13 faced a near disaster but recovered. The program concluded in 1972.

Today, NASA and Boeing are developing the Space Launch System (SLS), aiming to return humans to the moon. The SLS, along with the Orion spacecraft and SpaceX's Starship, represents the next chapter in lunar exploration. The SLS has already completed its maiden flight in 2022, demonstrating its capability.

Trump, the former U.S. president, secured the Republican nomination for the 2024 presidential race. He selected J.D. Vance, an Ohio senator and former Marine, as his running mate. The Republican National Convention, held in Milwaukee, finalized these nominations. Vance, a writer and venture capitalist, contributes military and political experience to the ticket. The convention also ratified the party's campaign platform.

### Asia's Dominance in Chip Production and Western Efforts to Diversify

  alt="Asia's Dominance in Chip Production and Western Efforts to Diversify"
/>

Asia's hold on chip production is strengthening as the West grapples with reducing its dependency. Once tech leaders, the U.S. and Europe now account for less than 10% of global chip production. Geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions are prompting governments to enhance local semiconductor manufacturing. The U.S. is offering $39 billion in grants, and the EU has its own initiatives.

However, transitioning chip production is intricate. Asia's dominance is entrenched, with Taiwan and South Korea spearheading high-end semiconductors. U.S. efforts, such as TSMC's Arizona factory, encounter delays and depend on Asian materials and European machinery. Chips produced in the West will still require Asian assembly and testing.

What lies ahead? A partial shift away from Asia, but not a complete one. New Western factories aim to diversify and bolster supply chains, albeit at increased costs. Isolation strategies, like restricting tech exports to China, could rebound, spurring China to innovate more. The chip war is underway, with no clear victor yet.

### Elon Musk Moves SpaceX and X to Texas Over California's Transgender Law

Elon Musk announced that SpaceX and X will move their headquarters from California to Texas. This decision follows California's new law preventing schools from notifying parents about a child's gender identity change. Musk criticized the law, calling it the "final straw" for his companies.

Musk's move reflects broader concerns about California's policies affecting families and businesses. His daughter's recent legal name and gender change, dropping the Musk surname, further underscores his stance.

Musk's endorsement of Trump and plans to fund a pro-Trump political action committee suggest alignment with potential rollback of transgender rights. Trump's proposals include halting Medicare and Medicaid funding for gender-affirming care and penalizing teachers for affirming students' gender identities.

Major medical organizations support access to necessary healthcare for transgender adolescents. Musk's relocation of Tesla's headquarters to Austin in 2021 signals a trend away from California's policies.

### El Salvador's Gang Crackdown Targets Thousands of Children

  alt="El Salvador's Gang Crackdown Targets Thousands of Children"

El Salvador's crackdown on gangs has detained over 3,000 children, some as young as 12. Human Rights Watch reports instances of arbitrary detentions and torture. Since 2022, more than 80,000 arrests have been made, significantly transforming the country from one of the most violent to one of the safest. Homicide rates have dropped dramatically from 103 to 2.4 per 100,000.

However, many of the arrested children have no connections to gangs. They are subjected to overcrowded and poor conditions in prison, often denied legal representation and family contact. Some were initially held with adults before being transferred to juvenile facilities described as "dangerous and dehumanizing."

Over 1,000 children have been convicted, with sentences ranging from two to 12 years, often based on vague charges. Confessions are frequently coerced.

Human Rights Watch is urging for reviews of these cases, particularly those involving children. They are also calling on foreign governments to withhold loans that benefit agencies involved in these abuses.

Despite these abuses, President Bukele remains popular. His re-election, despite constitutional bans, was facilitated by appointed judges. His victory in February's election has further pushed the country towards a one-party state.

### Gold Prices Surge Amidst Fed Rate Cut Expectations

Gold prices surged, nearing a record high. Investors bet on a Federal Reserve rate cut in September. Spot gold rose 0.7% to $2,438.83 per ounce. Futures climbed 0.6% to $2,443.80.

The Fed's potential rate cuts and softer inflation data boosted gold's appeal. The dollar's weakness also helped. Market expectations include three quarter-point rate cuts this year.

Central banks' gold purchases hit a 50-year high. Geopolitical risks and doubts about USD and EUR safety drive this demand. However, Chinese gold demand remains weak.

Gold mining stocks rallied. The VanEck Gold Miners ETF gained 1.2%. Harmony Gold and Gold Fields shares rose 6% and 4% respectively. DRDGold shares jumped over 5%.

Investors see gold as a safe haven. The market's quick rally on soft U.S. data and dovish Fed expectations reflects this sentiment. UBS strategist Joni Teves sees upside risks for gold prices.

  alt="New Framework to Enhance Research Integrity in Clinical Guidelines"

In 2023, over 10,000 scientific papers were retracted—a record. Many remained unchallenged, their flaws hidden. Monash University developed the RIGID framework to combat this. It assesses research integrity in clinical guidelines, aiming to prevent untrustworthy studies from influencing patient care.

At least 25% of clinical trials informing guidelines may be unreliable, says Professor Ben Mol, a co-lead author. The RIGID framework was first applied to guidelines for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), downloaded over 35,000 times. It uses a six-step process to evaluate research integrity, ensuring only trustworthy studies inform guidelines.

The framework emphasizes transparency. Studies flagged for integrity issues are documented, and authors are contacted for clarification. If no response, the research is excluded from guideline development.

In the PCOS guidelines, RIGID identified 45% of Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) as having moderate or high risk of integrity concerns. This ensures only reliable evidence guides clinical practice.

RIGID is now being applied to other international guidelines, aiming to clean up the scientific literature and protect patient care.

### Ultrahuman's Smart Ring Adds FDA-Approved AFib Detection

Ultrahuman's smart ring, the Ring Air, now detects AFib—a heart rhythm issue. This feature costs $4.90 monthly. It uses a method called photoplethysmography (PPG), which measures heart rhythm by shining light on the skin and tracking blood volume changes. This method is FDA-approved.

The ring competes with smart watches, especially Apple's, which also detects AFib but uses ECG technology. Ultrahuman aims to expand its market by offering customizable features through "PowerPlugs," allowing third-party developers to create apps based on the ring's health data.

Currently, the AFib detection feature is available in several countries, including Australia and the EU, with plans to launch in the U.S. and India soon. Ultrahuman's CEO, Mohit Kumar, emphasizes the ring's accuracy and the company's cautious approach to avoid false positives and negatives.

The ring's core features remain subscription-free, differentiating it from competitors like Oura. Ultrahuman plans to keep most new "PowerPlugs" free, with only a few premium services requiring additional costs. Privacy is maintained by sharing only anonymized data with third-party developers.

Ultrahuman's strategy focuses on customization and innovation, aiming to make the smart ring a versatile health tool without the need for a subscription.

More than 133,000 men die prematurely each year in the UK, which amounts to 15 every hour. Two out of five men pass away before the age of 75, frequently due to preventable conditions.

Men tend to delay seeking medical attention. Sixty-four percent wait over a week before seeing a doctor, and 48% avoid routine check-ups altogether. Less than 40% participate in NHS health checks.

The health of men in the UK falls short compared to that in other affluent nations. A boy born in 2021 is expected to live 78.7 years, which is four years less than a girl.

Major causes of death such as lung cancer and heart disease could be averted through lifestyle modifications and regular health screenings.

Suicide ranks as the leading cause of death among men aged 20 to 34 in England and Wales. Men are more prone to smoking, excessive drinking, and having high cholesterol and blood pressure levels.

A focused men’s health strategy could save lives and £9.4 billion annually. Movember advocates for the appointment of a national director for men’s health in England and a minister for men’s health in Scotland.

Significant change is imperative. Education and healthcare system reform are vital. A dedicated men’s health strategy is crucial.

### Rugby Concussions Linked to Neurodegenerative Proteins

Multiple concussions in rugby players have been linked to higher levels of proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Concussions, which are common in rugby, can result in repeated head trauma. This study indicates that these injuries lead to an increase in certain proteins in the blood, proteins that are often found in elevated amounts in individuals with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.

The findings suggest a potential risk for long-term brain health in rugby players, emphasizing the need for improved concussion management and prevention strategies in sports. Neurodegenerative diseases are conditions that gradually damage the brain's nerve cells, causing memory loss, cognitive decline, and other neurological issues.

The franchise, with three TV series and three films, contrasts the usual dark themes of Japanese school life with nostalgic, heartwarming scenes.

Kyushoku began in 1947, post-WWII, with American-supplied wheat bread and milk. It aimed to nourish starving Japanese children. By the 1960s, whole milk was standard, and today, options cater to various dietary needs. The typical tray includes milk, bread, a vegetable dish, and an entrée, all for about 255 yen ($1.58).

Whale meat, once a staple, faced controversy but has reappeared less frequently. Modern preferences lean towards pan-fried vegetables and fried chicken. The slice of white bread often gives way to a croissant, and a small dessert marks a privileged era.

Kyushoku's focus has never been solely on taste but on providing essential nutrients at a low cost. It has sustained generations, adapting yet retaining its core elements.
