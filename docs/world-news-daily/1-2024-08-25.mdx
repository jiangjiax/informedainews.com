Tuíre Kayapó, a Kayapo leader, died at 57, fighting for her tribe's rights in Brazil's Amazon. In 1989, at 19, she rallied 600 indigenous people against a dam on the Xingu River, vital for her tribe's survival and spirituality. Kayapó confronted the project head with a machete, declaring, "White man, you have no forest." This act made her a global symbol of indigenous resistance.

Her efforts delayed the dam's construction for 20 years, earning her the title of the woman who "postponed the end of the world." Kayapó's fight highlights the ongoing impact of Western colonialism and genocide, threatening indigenous lives worldwide. Her legacy challenges us to reconsider our relationship with the Earth and each other, advocating for harmony and respect.

The U.S. Department of Commerce has added 123 entities to its "Entity List," including 42 Chinese enterprises and institutions. This move aims to restrict exports to these entities, particularly in the field of electronic components for chips and semiconductors. Chinese entities included on the list range from Fuman Microelectronics Group to Hytera.

The U.S. government's action is partly targeting Russia's drone programs and military industrial complex as part of its sanctions against Russia. Entities on the list require U.S. companies to obtain a license before exporting technology and products to them. The U.S. Department of Commerce applies a "presumption of denial" policy to Chinese entities, meaning licenses are generally denied.

Additionally, the U.S. Treasury Department and State Department have imposed sanctions on approximately 400 entities under the "Specially Designated Nationals" (SDN) list, including 42 Chinese entities and individuals. The sanctions target Chinese companies involved in machine tools and microelectronics, as well as entities assisting Russia in procuring ammunition and evading sanctions.

To date, over 1,300 Chinese entities have been placed on the U.S. "Entity List," covering cutting-edge technology sectors such as AI, chips, and quantum computing. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has emphasized that despite disagreements, dialogue between China and the U.S. is necessary to ensure mutual understanding while protecting investments, progress, and opportunities brought by trade.

  alt="Expanding the Search for Human Fossils: Beyond the Rift Valley"
/>

Early human fossils primarily come from a small region of Africa—the East African Rift Valley. This area, which constitutes just 1% of the continent, has preserved numerous fossils, aiding scientists in reconstructing human evolution. However, this focus may overlook essential details.

A recent study by Andrew Barr and Bernard Wood at George Washington University underscores this bias. They compared the habitats of modern mammals in the Rift with those across Africa. They found that the Rift is home to only a fraction of the species.

Using modern primate skulls, they also demonstrated that the Rift's samples represent less than half of Africa's total variation. This indicates that our understanding of ancient humans is skewed.

Barr and Wood advocate for more extensive archaeological research. They encourage looking beyond the Rift to discover new fossil sites. This could help fill in the gaps in our knowledge of where and how early humans lived.

In essence, our understanding of human evolution is incomplete. By broadening our search, we might uncover a more detailed narrative of our past.

SHANGHAI — China's taxi drivers are grappling with intense competition from ride-hailing apps, autonomous vehicles, and even flying cars. Didi, the leading platform, holds a commanding 70% market share. The number of ride-hailing licenses issued has surged to over 7.1 million, doubling within just three years.

Drivers such as Xu rely on multiple smartphones to juggle various apps. Smartphones are crucial for securing customers. Xu operates WeChat on one device and Didi on three others.

While ride-hailing services provide flexibility, they also heighten competition. Drivers are drawn to cities with higher fare rates, like Shanghai. Zhang, a Didi driver, now works longer hours compared to when he first started.

The market is becoming saturated in certain regions. Authorities in cities like Chongqing, Suzhou, and Jingdezhen are cautioning prospective drivers about the risks of over-competition. Average daily earnings for drivers in Guangzhou have fallen by 12% compared to the previous year.

Robotaxis, which have been in testing since 2019, present a significant challenge to human drivers. Baidu's Level 4 autonomous taxis function without any human oversight. The emergence of flying taxis, such as AutoFlight's recent demonstration, introduces yet another competitive element.

Drivers contend that human presence provides essential security and interaction. Amidst ongoing technological advancements, the future of driving jobs remains uncertain.

New research presented at the Kansas City Fed’s annual conference in Wyoming challenges the idea that US Treasuries are a “safe haven.” The COVID-19 pandemic exposed weaknesses, showing that Treasury behavior was akin to that of other countries' debt. Instead of hoarding Treasuries, investors marked them down similarly to other bonds. Central banks' purchases of large quantities of these securities temporarily prop up prices but disadvantage taxpayers and favor bondholders. This move towards a risky debt model complicates the valuation of Treasuries and the functioning of the market.

A new US government report links high fluoride levels in drinking water to lower IQ in children. The National Toxicology Program found that water with more than 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter consistently lowers kids' IQs.

Fluoride, known for strengthening teeth, has been added to drinking water for decades. The current recommended limit is 0.7 milligrams per liter. The World Health Organization sets a safe limit at 1.5 milligrams.

About 1.9 million Americans drink water with naturally high fluoride levels. The report calls for more research and protection measures for these populations.

The American Dental Association, a longtime supporter of water fluoridation, is reviewing the report. Fluoride is naturally present in water and soil, and its benefits for dental health were discovered about 80 years ago.

The report raises questions about fluoride's impact on brain development, especially in children. It suggests pregnant women might need to reduce their fluoride intake from water and certain teas.

The West Nile virus outbreak has spread to multiple regions worldwide, with cases reported in Israel, Canada, the United States, and Spain. This summer alone, Israel has seen 858 infections and at least 62 deaths. The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and can cause symptoms such as fever and encephalitis, which can be fatal in severe cases. Currently, there are no specific drugs or vaccines available, and preventive measures include eliminating mosquitoes and preventing them from entering indoor spaces.

The West Nile virus was first identified in 1937 in Uganda, Africa, and is commonly found in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and West Asia. The virus has a complex pathogenic mechanism, making vaccine development challenging. Professor Zhao Wei from Southern Medical University notes that China has a wide distribution of Culex mosquitoes, posing an importation risk. He advises residents to avoid traveling to affected areas and to take mosquito-repellent measures when necessary.

It is important to note that many vector-borne diseases, such as dengue virus and Japanese encephalitis virus, lack specific treatments and can only be managed symptomatically. Professor Zhao Wei reminds that the West Nile virus is primarily transmitted by Culex mosquitoes, which are most active during dawn and dusk. Therefore, it is advisable to avoid going outdoors during these times.

Takeda Pharmaceutical, a Japanese drugmaker, plans to seek U.S. approval for its dengue vaccine. CEO Christophe Weber disclosed this move, aiming to break into the American vaccine market dominated by U.S. and European companies.

Dengue, a mosquito-borne virus, infects nearly 400 million people annually. Its spread is exacerbated by global warming. Takeda’s vaccine is notable as it is safe for children aged four and up, with minimal serious side effects. The World Health Organization endorses its use.

Takeda already sells the vaccine in Southeast Asia and Europe. They previously sought U.S. approval but withdrew. Now, they anticipate global sales reaching $2 billion annually.

Vaccines are crucial for medical economic security. During COVID-19, the U.S. boosted domestic vaccine production using the Defense Production Act, which grants the president emergency control over industries. Europe also restricted vaccine exports at one point.

Takeda focuses on developing vaccines for various infections, aiming to make vaccines a profit center alongside prescription drugs. Wider vaccine use could boost profits, funding further vaccine development and enhancing Japan’s competitiveness in the global vaccine market.

Tamarei, or flash-frozen scallops, are a favorite in sushi and tempura. Prices at Toyosu Market rose by 30% year-on-year. Tokyo fish shops now sell sashimi at rates approaching pre-ban levels.

Japan's scallop exports fell by 37% in the first half of 2024, but new markets helped offset losses. JETRO is focused on integrating scallops into global cuisines to cultivate long-term demand.

Hokkaido's scallop season began robustly, but shortages are anticipated due to escalating overseas demand. High prices are impacting their use in processed foods. Local businesses are adapting, though costs are straining them.

Diversification is crucial for Japan's fisheries. The goal is to reach 1.2 trillion yen in marine exports by 2030, with scallops playing a leading role.

Industrial farming prioritizes high yields, often at the expense of environmental adaptability. Researchers from Vermont University argue that small-scale farmers, with their diverse, locally-adapted crops, are crucial for future food security. They call for policies that integrate traditional seeds and farming methods for sustainable agriculture.

Yolanda Chen, a University of California evolutionary biologist, highlights the importance of small farmers in a changing climate. Since World War II, industrial farming has reshaped seed systems to meet population demands. However, Virginia University research suggests that small farmers will be key in maintaining seed diversity in the face of climate change.

Chen and colleagues discuss how professional crop breeders have disrupted the evolutionary process, creating a gap between "formal" and "informal" seed systems. The former dominates global seed sales, while the latter consists of farmers who select and breed diverse, locally-adapted varieties.

Small farmers provide essential ecosystem services, such as crop resilience to droughts and pests. As climate pressures increase, these services are vital for sustainability. Modern seed systems focus on high yields, often ignoring environmental conditions. This approach may fail in extreme climates.

Chen proposes that solutions lie in the diverse seeds kept by small farmers worldwide. These seeds, grown in various ecosystems, likely possess traits necessary for survival under climate change. She advocates for policies that value and support the diversity of seeds created by small farmers, ensuring their contributions are recognized and utilized in mainstream agriculture.

This shift from a yield-centric mindset to one centered on evolution and biodiversity is essential for sustainable agriculture.
