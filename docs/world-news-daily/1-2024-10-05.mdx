The European Union (EU) has voted to impose tariffs of up to 45% on Chinese electric vehicle (EV) imports. The decision follows a year-long anti-subsidy investigation, which the EU claims reveals unfair Chinese subsidies.

In a recent vote, 10 EU members supported the tariffs, while five opposed and 12 abstained. Germany, the bloc’s largest economy and a major car producer, voted against the measure.

Critics, including BMW’s CEO Oliver Zipse, argue the tariffs could escalate into a trade conflict. Volkswagen echoed this sentiment, calling the tariffs “the wrong approach.”

China, viewed by the EU as both a partner and a competitor, has not yet responded to the decision. In potential retaliation, Beijing has launched probes into EU imports of brandy, dairy, and pork.

The EU’s move is partly driven by China’s surplus EV production capacity, estimated at three million vehicles annually—twice the size of the EU market. With the U.S. and Canada already imposing 100% tariffs, Europe becomes the most viable export destination.

Despite the vote, the EU remains open to negotiations with China, potentially exploring alternative solutions to tariffs.

The US Supreme Court will decide on a $10 billion lawsuit filed by Mexico against US gun manufacturers. Mexico claims these companies' negligent practices fuel violence by supplying drug cartels. The lawsuit names Smith & Wesson, Barrett Firearms, Beretta, Colt, Glock, and Interstate Arms.

Mexico asserts that 70% of trafficked weapons come from the US, contributing to 17,000 homicides in 2019. The damage, they say, equals 1.7-2% of Mexico’s GDP. The firearms industry denies these claims, arguing Mexico’s crime is its own responsibility.

The case has faced multiple court rulings. Initially dismissed, it was revived by a US appeals court. Now, the Supreme Court will review the gunmakers' appeal, who argue their practices are lawful.

Mexico’s lawyers defend their case, stating US gunmakers knowingly sell to “straw buyers” who supply cartels. Smith & Wesson counters that Mexico seeks to bankrupt the US firearms industry with a “novel and far-fetched” claim.

This isn’t the first time US guns have been blamed for destabilizing foreign nations. A UN report estimates half a million weapons have flooded into Haiti since 2020. The US plans a new policing unit to address this issue.

### EU Court Rules Against Meta Using Sexual Orientation for Targeted Ads

The EU's highest court ruled that Meta cannot use a user's sexual orientation for targeted ads, even if the user is openly queer. This decision follows a case brought by Max Schrems, an Austrian privacy activist. Schrems argued that Meta violated EU privacy laws by collecting data on his sexual orientation from various online activities, using it to target LGBTQ-specific ads. Meta denies this practice, claiming it treats sexual orientation data as sensitive and does not indiscriminately use it for advertising.

Initially, an Austrian court allowed Meta to target Schrems based on his public statements about being gay. However, the EU court overruled this, stating that public statements do not permit tech companies to target sensitive ads. The court also supported Schrems' claim that Meta gathers data from beyond its social media platforms.

Meta asserts it takes privacy seriously and offers user settings to control data usage. Schrems' lawyer, Katharina Raabe-Stuppnig, emphasized the ruling's impact on Meta's extensive data pool, limiting its use for advertising despite user consent.

The ruling is significant, especially for LGBTQ+ individuals in countries where homosexuality is illegal. Targeted ads could out them, posing safety risks. While tech companies may profit from deducing sexual orientation, they cannot jeopardize users' safety for financial gain.

  alt="Haitian Gang Massacre Leaves 70 Dead and 6,000 Fleeing"
/>

In the early hours of November 3, the Gran Grif gang, led by Luckson Elan, launched a brutal attack on Pont-Sonde, a rural area in Haiti's Artibonite region. The assault resulted in at least 70 deaths and forced over 6,000 residents to flee their homes. The gang claimed the massacre was retaliation for local passivity during police and militia operations that killed their members.

The United Nations migration agency reported that most displaced individuals sought refuge in nearby towns like Saint-Marc, while others found temporary shelter in makeshift camps. The Haitian government confirmed that the gang not only killed indiscriminately but also set fire to numerous homes and vehicles, marking one of the worst attacks in recent years.

Prime Minister Garry Conille condemned the violence, calling it an attack on the entire Haitian people. Security forces have since bolstered defenses in the area. The National Police replaced the local police chief and deployed additional forces to stabilize the situation.

Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, and its surrounding areas are largely controlled by armed gangs, leading to widespread hunger and homelessness. Despite international pledges, aid remains insufficient. Neighboring countries like the Dominican Republic and the United States continue to repatriate migrants, exacerbating the crisis.

Witnesses described the gang's methodical rampage, shooting residents and setting fires as they moved through the community. The RNDDH human rights organization warned that the death toll could be higher, as some families were entirely wiped out.

Pont-Sonde has long been a hotspot for violence, with residents pleading for enhanced protection. The Gran Grif gang, known for kidnappings, rapes, murders, and forced evictions, has frequently terrorized the area. Elan was recently added to the UN sanctions list.

The UN refugee agency cautioned that gang activity is obstructing humanitarian aid, leading to potential catastrophic shortages of food and medical supplies. Haiti has received only a fraction of the promised international support, with just over 400 officers deployed.

OpenAI secures $66 billion in fresh funding, valuing the AI giant at $1570 billion. Thrive Capital leads the round, with Microsoft, Nvidia, and others joining in. The infusion aims to bolster OpenAI's research and expand its user base, which now exceeds 2.5 billion weekly.

The funding comes with conditions: conversion to equity hinges on OpenAI transitioning to a for-profit entity, shedding its non-profit board's control. This shift could also grant CEO Sam Altman equity for the first time. Current investors face a 100x profit cap, but this may change.

Thrive Capital gains a unique deal: if OpenAI meets revenue targets, Thrive can invest an additional $10 billion next year at the same valuation.

OpenAI reportedly pressures investors to shun competitors like Anthropic, xAI, and SSI. Elon Musk criticizes this move on Twitter.

OpenAI's recent exodus of key personnel, including CTO Mira Murati, fuels speculation about internal turmoil. Despite this, Altman insists the departures are unrelated to the restructuring.

In essence, OpenAI's bold moves reflect the high stakes and rapid evolution in the AI sector. The company's trajectory will be closely watched as it navigates these complex waters.

/>

The team led by Professor Jia Fumin at Fudan University has developed a new generation of implantable brain-spine interface devices, offering hope for spinal cord injury patients to regain the ability to walk. The device establishes a "neural bypass" by implanting electrode chips in both the brain and spinal cord, enabling paralyzed patients to autonomously control their muscles and restore lower limb function.

The key to this technology lies in precisely stimulating the spinal nerve roots to reconstruct the walking gait. The team utilized a 3T MRI scanner to construct personalized spinal nerve root models and open-sourced the relevant data to support neurorehabilitation research. Additionally, the team employed multimodal technology to monitor gait in real-time, ensuring the optimization of stimulation parameters.

The Jia Fumin team also proposed a "three-in-one" system design, integrating brain signal acquisition with spinal stimulation devices, reducing incisions, enhancing signal acquisition stability and decoding speed, and making patients' walking more natural and fluid.

Professor Jia Fumin, who has been involved in the development of China's first generation of implantable neurostimulation equipment, understands the challenges of transforming research into clinical applications. He anticipates that it will take a decade for brain-spine interface technology to transition from research to clinical use and is prepared for the long haul.

The technology is expected to begin its first clinical trial by the end of the year. If successful, it will bring revolutionary changes to spinal cord injury patients.

### New COVID-19 Vaccines Target Omicron KP.2 Subvariant

New COVID-19 vaccines, targeting the Omicron KP.2 subvariant, are rolling out at pharmacies. These mRNA vaccines, from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, aim to reduce infection risk and severity. While they won't stop transmission entirely, they are crucial for high-risk groups: seniors, immunocompromised individuals, and those with limited healthcare access.

Vaccine fatigue and misinformation have hindered uptake. Yet, all adults should consider the updated shot, especially given the virus's persistent spread. The vaccines are available to everyone six months and older, including those previously vaccinated or unvaccinated.

COVID-19 remains a concern, with indicators stable but elevated. Health officials emphasize staying home when sick, masking, and covering coughs. The virus is endemic, meaning annual shots for COVID and flu are likely.

Experts stress the importance of tailored messaging to address vaccine hesitancy and protect vulnerable populations. The goal is to prevent transmission to high-risk individuals and preserve healthcare capacity.

In summary, the new vaccines offer enhanced protection against current variants. Uptake is vital, especially for those at higher risk. The virus isn't going away; our future involves adapting to its presence.

Doctors are celebrating a new drug combo that slows lung cancer progression by 40% longer than standard treatment. Lung cancer kills 1.8 million people yearly. Advanced cases fare worse.

In a global trial, patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and an EGFR mutation—common in women and light smokers—lived 23.7 months without disease progression on amivantamab and lazertinib. Standard treatment, osimertinib, offered 16.6 months.

Amivantamab is a monoclonal antibody; lazertinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Both target cancer cells. Combining them improved survival rates. The FDA approved the combo in August. UK availability hinges on NHS endorsement.

Side effects included rashes, infections, and blood clots. Precision medicine, tailoring treatments to genetic profiles, drives these advances.

Paula Chadwick of the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation calls new treatments "rocket fuel for hope." Anna Kinsella of Cancer Research UK sees a "golden age" of cancer research, improving lives and reducing fear.
