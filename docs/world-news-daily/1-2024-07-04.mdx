# World News Daily(2024-07-04) : Japanese Government Ordered to Pay Damages for Forced Sterilizations

## Japanese Government Ordered to Pay Damages for Forced Sterilizations

Japan's Supreme Court has ordered the government to pay damages to 39 plaintiffs, victims of forced sterilizations under a 1948 eugenics law. This law, which remained in effect until 1996, permitted doctors to sterilize individuals to prevent "poor quality descendants." The government has acknowledged 16,500 forced sterilizations, including some on children as young as nine years old.

The court deemed the eugenics law unconstitutional, violating the right to equality and bodily autonomy. The government contended that the statute of limitations had expired, but the court disagreed.

These compensation claims followed a 2018 lawsuit by a woman who was sterilized at the age of 15 due to an intellectual disability. In 2019, the government issued an apology and offered lump-sum payments of ¥3.2 million per victim, but survivors sought additional compensation. High courts have awarded higher damages, ruling the statute of limitations unjust.

Similar measures in Germany and Sweden have resulted in apologies and compensation. This ruling underscores Japan's past mistreatment of individuals with disabilities and chronic illnesses.

### UK Supreme Court Ruling Could Lead to Increased Lawsuits Against Water Companies Over Sewage Discharges

Water companies in the UK may face a surge of lawsuits over sewage discharges, following a Supreme Court ruling. The court allowed the Manchester Ship Canal Company to sue United Utilities for raw sewage release into the canal. This decision opens the door for adjacent waterway owners and the public to sue other utility companies.

Environmental groups welcomed the ruling, highlighting the financial and regulatory pressures on water companies for unauthorized waste discharges. The judges noted that better infrastructure investments could prevent such incidents.

United Utilities has about 100 outfalls along the canal, where treated waste is released. Raw sewage is also dumped during system overloads. The company argued that only regulators could act on spills, but the court disagreed.

Lawyers predict a wave of claims from affected parties, including swimmers, fishermen, and environmental organizations. The ruling could impact water companies' financial stability, potentially affecting consumer bills.

The Environmental Law Foundation praised the ruling as a victory for environmental justice. However, the ruling adds to the challenges faced by utility companies, already burdened with significant debt.

  alt="New Antarctic Ice Melt Discovery Alters Sea Level Rise Predictions"

Scientists have discovered a new mechanism by which ice melts under Antarctica. Warm ocean water infiltrates beneath the ice, causing it to melt more rapidly. This phenomenon was not accounted for in previous models, leading to incorrect predictions about the rate of sea-level rise.

The critical area where the ice meets the sea, known as the grounding zone, is particularly vulnerable. The warm water melts this region, expediting the movement of ice into the sea. Even minor increases in ocean temperature can significantly accelerate this melting process.

The existing models overlooked this factor, which is why the ice is melting more quickly than anticipated. Incorporating this new information into the models will improve predictions of how rapidly sea levels will rise.

This new insight could alter our future planning strategies. Understanding the true rate of ice melt is essential for preparing for higher sea levels.

### TikTok's Enduring Influence on American Trends

TikTok, originating from China's Douyin, has revolutionized American trends within just six years. Its influence extends across fashion, cosmetics, and food, igniting fast-paced fads such as "latte makeup" and "smash burger" tacos. Despite debates over national security that could lead to bans, TikTok's impact remains strong.

The platform's algorithm, though mysterious, serves as its "secret sauce," customizing content based on interests rather than just social connections. This change has democratized content creation, prioritizing authenticity over polished posts.

TikTok's influence also shapes personal styles and purchasing decisions, often marked with #tiktokmademebuyit. Despite criticisms of fostering addictive behaviors and superficial trends, its cultural impact is undeniable.

For many, TikTok is not merely a trendsetter; it is a liberator, enabling individuals to explore and express their unique styles freely. Whether enduring or fleeting, TikTok's trends mirror a broader cultural shift towards personalization and immediacy in consumer behavior.

### Global Shift in Natural Gas Market and Its Implications

Natural gas is going global. Historically regional, it's now easier to ship worldwide due to liquefaction tech. This shift mirrors oil's global market.

Shehriyar Antia, from PGIM, notes smaller price differences between regions as shipping becomes simpler. Over a decade, liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade nearly doubled.

The U.S. leads in LNG exports, with Cheniere Energy a key player. Cheniere's capacity is massive, making it a top global exporter. Analysts see potential in its stock.

Demand for natural gas surges, especially in China and India, as they shift from coal. LNG is seen as a cleaner alternative, though its environmental impact is debated.

LNG's role in energy security is crucial, notably post-Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The U.S. has stepped in as a major LNG supplier to Europe.

In short, natural gas is evolving into a pivotal global energy source, bridging the gap between traditional fuels and renewables.

### Young Chess Prodigy Joins England Women's Team

Bodhana Sivanandan, aged nine, from Harrow, London, will join the England Women’s Team at the Chess Olympiad in Hungary. She is set to become the youngest England player ever in any sport, being almost 15 years younger than her next teammate, Lan Yao, aged 23.

### Celebrating 'Seven Samurai' at 70: Kurosawa's Timeless Epic

"Seven Samurai," Akira Kurosawa's 1954 epic, celebrates its 70th anniversary. Despite its age, the film remains vibrant, chronicling a village's decision to hire samurai to protect them from bandits. The film's rapid, dynamic action scenes reflect the intense battles led by its protagonist.

Kurosawa's masterpiece, a cornerstone of cinema, has profoundly influenced numerous filmmakers. Martin Scorsese and George Lucas hold it in high regard, while Alexander Payne considers it life-altering.

To mark its anniversary, a new restoration of the film is being showcased in theaters. While "Seven Samurai" isn't universally beloved, its influence is undeniable. It has inspired works ranging from "Star Wars" to "A Bug's Life."

Filmed over 148 days, it was the most expensive Japanese film of its time. Themes of sacrifice and community resonate deeply, set against the backdrop of postwar Japan. The film's tension is palpable not only in the battles but also in the interactions between the samurai and the villagers.

"Seven Samurai" continues to stand out. Its choreography, rain scenes, and the performance of Toshiro Mifune are particularly notable. However, the film's depth extends beyond these individual elements. Kurosawa's work, both hopeful and tragic, delves into universal truths about soldiers. Its quiet moments convey profound messages.

Indonesia is planning a nationwide school lunch program. President-elect Prabowo Subianto aims to provide free meals to 78.5 million students. The objective is to reduce malnutrition and stunted growth.

Currently, Indonesian schools rarely prepare meals. Students usually purchase food from canteens or street vendors, or bring lunch from home.

Japan is offering assistance through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). In September, JICA will host Indonesian officials in Tokyo and Nagasaki, sharing insights on Japan’s school lunch system and nutrition policies. Japan’s system started in 1889, focusing on nutrition and combating poverty. Lunches are designed by nutritionists, cooked on-site, and serve as educational tools for etiquette and healthy habits.

JICA is also considering sending experts to Indonesia’s new school meal organization. Discussions include support in areas such as hygiene standards and facility construction.

Indonesia is looking to Japan, China, and India for best practices. Prabowo visited a Beijing middle school in April. The Indian embassy noted Vice President-elect Gibran Rakabuming’s appreciation for India’s successful free school meals.

The program’s estimated annual cost is 450 trillion rupiah. The government plans to allocate 71 trillion rupiah for 2025.
