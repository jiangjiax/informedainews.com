Change Healthcare, a key player in U.S. healthcare data processing, experienced a significant ransomware attack in February. This incident caused widespread disruption in the American healthcare system, impacting numerous patients and leading to delays in medical services and prescriptions. The breach exposed a wide range of personal and medical information, including names, addresses, social security numbers, and comprehensive health records.

Initially, as part of UnitedHealth Group, Change Healthcare faced challenges in precisely identifying what data was compromised due to the breach's complexity and scale. They have since been working to notify affected individuals, beginning in late July. This event underscores the vulnerability of critical healthcare infrastructure to cyber threats and its profound impact on individual privacy and healthcare operations.

UnitedHealth Group encountered further complications when it became apparent that paying the initial ransom to the cybercriminal group ALPHV did not ensure the return of all stolen data. Another group, RansomHub, claimed to have acquired the data and demanded additional payment. This situation highlights the precarious nature of dealing with ransomware attackers and the potential for ongoing extortion.

The breach has had significant financial repercussions for UnitedHealth, with reported losses of about $8.7 billion in the first quarter of the year. The incident also raises concerns about cybersecurity practices within large corporations, particularly the absence of robust multi-factor authentication that could have potentially lessened the attack's impact.

### China issues guidelines for punishing 'diehard Taiwan separatists'

China issues guidelines for punishing 'diehard Taiwan separatists,' including death sentences for those causing grave harm to the state. The document targets Taiwan President Lai Ching-te's administration for not accepting the 'one-China' principle. Beijing aims to pressure Taipei by punishing acts promoting Taiwan's independence, such as organizing schemes to split the state or participating in international organizations as a sovereign state. Trials in absentia are possible, even for defendants outside the country. Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council rejects Beijing's jurisdiction over Taiwan and urges Taiwanese citizens to resist China's threats. The announcement highlights the contrast between China's authoritarian system and Taiwan's democratic one, impacting cross-strait relations and exchanges.

In Virginia, a new law shields residents from utility disconnections during extreme heat, commencing July 1. This legislation, opposed by utilities, bans cutoffs when temperatures surpass 92 degrees and on specific days to avert prolonged outages. State Senator Lashrecse Aird, a proponent, underscores the urgency due to rising global temperatures.

Across the U.S., utility disconnection protections vary significantly. Many states lack comprehensive safeguards, leaving millions at risk of power shutoffs, particularly during heatwaves. David Konisky, from Indiana University's Energy Justice Lab, emphasizes the critical need for improved policies, noting that current laws often fall short, focusing on regulated companies and lacking clear criteria.

The lab's "Disconnect Dashboard" exposes gaps in state protections, highlighting the dire need for more robust legislation. Konisky advocates for proactive measures such as affordable payment plans and energy assistance, prioritizing these over disconnections, which can be life-threatening in extreme heat.

As climate change escalates, the urgency to protect vulnerable populations from heat-related utility cutoffs intensifies. Virginia's law marks a step forward, but broader, more inclusive policies are essential nationwide.

In the era of fleeting short videos, long videos, with their profound storytelling and rich character development, have become a source of nationwide discussion. Unlike the fragmented nature of short videos, long videos can transcend age, gender, and occupation, uniting audiences from diverse backgrounds to create a shared cultural experience. High-quality long videos like "My Altay" not only spark a binge-watching craze but also ignite discussions on social media, driving related industries and showcasing significant commercial potential.

Long video platforms, through continuous investment and the addition of top talents, enhance content quality, attracting a vast and high-quality user base. The trend towards theaterization is strengthening, exemplified by iQIYI's Mist Theater focusing on suspense, solidifying its influence in the genre. Premium long videos create shared experiences, breaking through information silos, stimulating audience thought and discussion, conveying universal values, and establishing lasting cultural influence.

Brand marketing and long video platforms engage in a "mutual pursuit." Quality content leads to spillover influence, such as "The Queen's Gambit" boosting chess set sales and "My Altay" promoting local tourism. The centralization of IPs unleashes diverse commercial values, like "Fox Spirit Matchmaker: Moon Red Chapter" partnering with brands to offer immersive advertising experiences through innovative technology. Long videos not only offer "immediate" value through brand collaborations during broadcast but also hold long-term value as IPs.

Long videos are redefining the content and commercial ecosystem, crafting premium content, building centralized influence, attracting a vast high-quality user base, and collectively creating rich shared experiences. Platforms, based on a broad and precise audience, and driven by significant social influence, not only build a vibrant and valuable content ecosystem but also serve as a key prerequisite for leading the commercialization trend of long videos.
