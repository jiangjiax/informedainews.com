# World News Daily(2024-08-04) : U.S. Sues TikTok for Violating Children's Privacy

## U.S. Sues TikTok for Violating Children's Privacy

The U.S. Justice Department is suing TikTok and ByteDance, accusing them of failing to protect the privacy of children under 13, thereby violating the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). They are required to obtain parental consent for data collection. TikTok permitted underage users to create accounts, shared videos and messages with adults, and collected personal information without parental consent, affecting millions of American children.

The FTC is seeking penalties of up to $51,744 per violation per day. TikTok has been working with the FTC for over a year and is disappointed by the litigation. With 170 million U.S. users, TikTok faces potential divestiture or a ban and has already faced fines in the EU and U.K. over children's data.

A U.S. Senate bill proposes extending COPPA to cover those up to age 17, banning targeted ads to kids and teens, and allowing the deletion of information from social media. It requires House approval to become law.

### EU's Digital Regulations Impact on Big Tech

The EU's Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA) aim to curb Big Tech's dominance. Both laws, enacted in 2024, target platforms like Amazon, Apple, and Google, imposing hefty fines for violations.

The DSA focuses on consumer welfare and content moderation, setting high standards for handling illegal content and disinformation. It applies stricter rules to larger platforms, aiming to balance freedom of expression with safety.

The DMA, more aggressive, targets "gatekeepers" like Apple and Meta, limiting their control over platforms. It mandates openness, like allowing third-party app stores on iOS and interoperability in messaging services.

Both laws centralize enforcement, avoiding jurisdictional conflicts. The EU hopes these regulations will foster competition and innovation, ensuring a fair digital market.

Initial investigations show resistance from some tech giants, highlighting the challenges ahead. The success of these laws will unfold over time, shaping the future of digital markets in Europe.

Trump's spokesperson denies allegations of a $10m gift from Egypt's Sisi in 2016. The Washington Post reports a secret US investigation into the matter. Steven Cheung claims the probe found no wrongdoing and was closed.

The Post details a $10m withdrawal from Egypt's National Bank days before Trump's inauguration. US officials described the cash as heavy bags of $100 bills. Investigators discovered this in 2019, two years after initial CIA intelligence on Sisi's intent.

Such a foreign donation would break federal law. Trump's praise for Sisi raised eyebrows, given his authoritarian rule. The investigation faced scrutiny, notably from Attorney General William Barr, who appointed a prosecutor to close the case without charges.

The Post's report comes amid Trump's 2024 presidential bid and the bribery conviction of Senator Robert Menendez, who took Egyptian gold and cash. Menendez faces up to 222 years in prison.

The justice department and FBI declined to comment. The closing prosecutor, Michael Sherwin, stands by his decision. An anonymous source questions the justice department's handling of the case, suggesting a lack of thorough investigation.

### Climate Change Accelerates Greenland Ice Sheet Melting Research

Climate warming has a far greater impact on the Greenland ice sheet than climate cooling. Research reveals that the "sponginess" of the ice sheet—the ability of the firn layer to store meltwater—rapidly declines with warming and recovers slowly with cooling. The firn layer, which covers about 90% of the ice sheet at high altitudes, is crucial for buffering sea-level rise.

The study utilized the SNOWPACK model to comprehensively analyze for the first time the impact of temperature changes on the entire ice sheet's firn layer. The results show that the ice sheet loses mass faster during warming than it gains during cooling. This asymmetry means that even if geoengineering efforts are used to lower Arctic temperatures, the protective effects on the ice may be limited.

This research underscores the immense difficulty of reversing climate warming. Cooling would need to exceed warming to restore the normal state of firn and glaciers. In reality, reversing the changes that have already been caused is extremely difficult.

In South Korea, the birth rate has plummeted to 0.76, with just 60,000 births in the first quarter of 2024. This decline mirrors trends in Japan and Spain, where low fertility rates reflect a broader global shift in attitudes towards parenthood.

Young adults now approach childbirth with caution, influenced by economic pressures and societal changes. The concept of "birth consent" has emerged, suggesting that unborn children should have a say in their arrival. This idea challenges traditional views on the rights of parents versus the rights of the unborn.

The article explores the complexities of this debate through the fictional scenario of "birth consent" checks, where fetuses are asked if they wish to be born. This raises profound questions about autonomy and the nature of life itself.

Economic factors, including high housing costs and education expenses, contribute to the reluctance to have children. Social media and cultural shifts also play roles, with discussions about the hardships of parenting influencing public opinion.

The article concludes by questioning the authenticity of our choices in life, whether influenced by external factors or genuine free will. It suggests that the decision to have children, like many life choices, is complex and multifaceted.

### The virtual currency market experiences severe fluctuations: Bitcoin prices plummet, and miners face challenges.

The virtual currency market has recently experienced significant volatility, with Bitcoin's price briefly falling below $61,000. Other major cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Binance Coin, and Dogecoin also saw substantial declines. The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies dropped below $2.2 trillion, with over $880 billion in market value evaporating. In the past 24 hours, nearly 100,000 investors were liquidated, with a total liquidation amount reaching $330 million.

Bitcoin's price has fluctuated between $55,000 and $70,000 since July, and it is expected to continue within this range in the coming months. Global economic conditions and fluctuations in the dollar exchange rate significantly impact the market. The virtual currency market is influenced by supply and demand, regulatory policies, and global economic cycles, leading to high price volatility.

Bitcoin miners' revenues have sharply declined due to the halving of mining rewards, leading to sustained selling. The Bitcoin network's mining reward has been reduced from 6.25 Bitcoins to 3.125 Bitcoins, directly affecting miners' income. Miners' operating costs, such as electricity and equipment fees, have not decreased, leading to financial crises.

The mining machine production market is oversupplied, with an estimated 5 million mining machines expected to enter the market next year, increasing the total network hash rate by 1,300 EH/s. This will result in a significant decrease in miners' earnings and an extended payback period.

**Explanation:**
- **Liquidation:** Refers to investors being forced to close their positions due to an inability to meet margin requirements, resulting in a loss of funds.
- **Mining Reward:** The reward given by the Bitcoin network to miners who successfully validate transactions.
- **Hash Rate:** The processing power of mining machines, measured in EH/s (exahashes per second).

### AI Accelerates Nuclear Reactor Design and Licensing

A professor at Brigham Young University has discovered a method to expedite nuclear reactor design and licensing through the use of AI. Traditional processes require 20 years and $1 billion for licensing a design, followed by an additional five years and $5 to $30 billion for construction. AI has the potential to reduce this timeline by a decade, resulting in significant savings.

The design of nuclear reactors involves intricate physics, encompassing neutron movement, heat transfer, and materials. These elements are closely interrelated, rendering the process data-intensive and time-consuming. AI can alleviate this burden, facilitating quicker and more cost-effective designs.

Professor Memmott and his team have developed machine learning algorithms to forecast temperature profiles and optimize reactor parameters. Their AI model can geometrically optimize designs at a much faster pace than conventional methods. For instance, their AI took just two days to determine an optimal reactor shield design, a task that a real-world company took six months to complete.

Although human oversight remains crucial for final decisions and safety assurance, AI substantially cuts down on design time. With increasing energy demands, faster and more affordable nuclear reactor designs could be essential for meeting future power requirements without emissions.
