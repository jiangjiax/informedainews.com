Rivers dried up faster in 2023 than in three decades. This puts global water supply at risk. Over the past five years, river levels have been lower than average worldwide. Reservoirs are also low.

In 2023, more than half of global river catchment areas faced abnormal conditions. Most were in deficit. Severe drought and low river discharge affected large areas in North, Central, and South America. The Amazon and Mississippi rivers had record low water levels. In Asia and Oceania, the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Mekong rivers also struggled.

Climate change is altering water distribution. It causes extreme floods and droughts. 2023 was the hottest year on record. Rivers ran low, and countries faced droughts. Yet, devastating floods hit various parts of the globe.

The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) linked these extremes to the transition from La Niña to El Niño in mid-2023. These are natural weather patterns. El Niño brings warmer sea-surface temperatures. La Niña brings cooler temperatures. Climate change is making these patterns more intense and unpredictable.

Flooding occurred in East Africa, New Zealand, and the Philippines. In the UK, Ireland, Finland, and Sweden, rivers had above-normal discharge.

WMO Secretary General Celeste Saulo said, "Water is the canary in the coalmine of climate change." Extreme rainfall, floods, and droughts are signals of distress. Melting ice and glaciers threaten long-term water security. Yet, urgent action is lacking.

Rising temperatures accelerate the hydrological cycle. It becomes more erratic. We face either too much or too little water. A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, leading to heavy rainfall. Rapid evaporation and soil drying worsen droughts.

Currently, 3.6 billion people lack adequate water access for at least one month a year. This is expected to rise to over 5 billion by 2050. Glaciers lost more than 600 gigatonnes of water in 2023, the highest in 50 years. Western North America and the European Alps faced extreme melting. Switzerland's Alps lost about 10% of their volume in two years.

Saulo emphasized the need for better monitoring and data-sharing. We must manage what we measure. This report aims to improve cross-border collaboration and assessments. Urgent action is needed.

  alt="The National Development and Reform Commission announced that it will continue to issue ultra-long-term special treasury bonds next year, with a focus on supporting major infrastructure and livelihood projects."
/>

Director of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) Zheng Shanjie announced at a press conference on October 8 that the issuance of ultra-long-term special treasury bonds will continue next year, with a focus on supporting "two major" construction projects. This year, 700 billion yuan in central budgetary investment and 1 trillion yuan in ultra-long-term special treasury bonds have already been allocated for "two major and one new" projects.

The NDRC will advance the allocation of 100 billion yuan in central budgetary investment and 100 billion yuan in "two major" construction project lists for next year to support local governments in accelerating preliminary work. Additionally, the NDRC will study expanding the areas and proportions of special bonds that can be used as capital, and optimize the management of local government special bonds.

To address insufficient domestic effective demand, the NDRC will focus on benefiting people's livelihoods and promoting consumption. It will also intensify support for local governments to carry out debt swaps to resolve debt risks, and urge local governments to complete the issuance of approximately 290 billion yuan in local government special bonds by the end of October.

The NDRC will also standardize administrative law enforcement to prevent arbitrary fines and inspections, and study the extension of certain tax and fee support policies. A coordination mechanism to support small and micro enterprises' financing will be established to enhance the consistency of macroeconomic policy orientation.

Zhao Chenxin, Deputy Director of the NDRC, expressed confidence in achieving the annual economic and social development goals. Over the next five years, the total investment demand for urban gas and other sectors is expected to be around 4 trillion yuan, with priority given to urban renewal and underground pipeline network projects.

**Notes:**
- **"Two major" construction**: Refers to major infrastructure and major livelihood projects.
- **"Two major and one new"**: Refers to major infrastructure, major livelihood projects, and new infrastructure.
- **Special bonds**: Local government special bonds, used for financing specific projects.

### Taiwan's Billion-Dollar Inheritance Scam Targeting Lonely Deaths

  alt="Taiwan's Billion-Dollar Inheritance Scam Targeting Lonely Deaths"
/>

In Taiwan, a sophisticated scam targeting unclaimed inheritances has netted over NT$1.4 billion in a year. The "Ground Master" scheme, reminiscent of a 2017 Tokyo fraud, involves forged documents and fake identities. The ringleader, a land broker, recruited professionals like police, lawyers, and land agents to exploit the growing phenomenon of "lonely deaths"—elderly individuals dying alone without immediate heirs.

The scam operates by identifying unclaimed properties listed by local governments. These properties, often worth billions, are left unclaimed for over a year, making them prime targets. The criminals use fake wills to transfer ownership, exploiting the lack of immediate family to contest the claims.

One victim, a man living in the U.S., discovered his deceased mother's property had been fraudulently transferred. Despite initial success, the scam unraveled when suspicious bank staff halted a transaction. The man's subsequent legal action led to the arrest of over 40 individuals involved in similar schemes.

This case highlights the vulnerability of unclaimed assets in an aging society. It underscores the need for tighter regulations and public awareness to protect against such sophisticated frauds.

### Uber Expands EV Options and Launches AI Chatbot for Sustainable Mobility

Uber now allows users to default to fully electric vehicles in over 40 cities. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi announced this at Uber's Go Get Zero conference in London. The move aims to align with global zero-emission goals.

Uber Green, previously a mix of EVs and hybrids, now exclusively offers battery electric vehicles. The company also introduced an AI chatbot to guide drivers interested in switching to EVs.

Transportation accounts for 25% of global carbon emissions. Uber aims to be a zero-emissions platform by 2040.

For drivers, Uber launched an "EV Mentor" program and a partnership with Octopus Energy and BYD to fund 1,000 free home chargers in the U.K. This reduces charging costs and promotes EV adoption.

On the delivery side, Uber Eats adds farmers' market produce in NYC and LA. In Paris, Uber invests in sustainable packaging for restaurants.

France mandates reduced plastic waste, aligning with Uber's sustainability push.

**Insights:**
Uber's shift to EVs and sustainable practices is a significant step. The AI chatbot and EV Mentor program simplify the transition for drivers. Partnerships with energy suppliers and EV manufacturers further this goal.

The move addresses environmental concerns and regulatory pressures. It positions Uber as a leader in sustainable mobility. However, success hinges on broader policy support and infrastructure development.

### MIGA Model Enhances Stock Market Prediction with Mixture-of-Experts Approach

Stock market prediction is challenging. Current models employ a single large model for all stocks, but this approach is ineffective due to the variability among stocks. MIGA, a new model, utilizes "experts"—specialized models tailored to different types of stocks. It enhances performance by allowing these experts to share information. MIGA outperforms other models, particularly on Chinese indices like CSI300. It demonstrates a 24% annual return, which is 8% higher than previous models. This approach has the potential to revolutionize stock prediction.

  alt="World Bank Predicts Slowing Growth for China in 2025 Despite Stimulus"
/>

China's growth is expected to slow in 2025, despite recent stimulus measures. The World Bank forecasts a decline to 4.3% from 4.8% in 2024. While monetary stimulus boosted investor confidence initially, it failed to sustain it.

Aaditya Mattoo, the World Bank's chief economist for East Asia and the Pacific, points out that the stimulus lacks a clear fiscal component, complicating growth projections. Consumer concerns—including declining salaries, property incomes, and social fears—are weighing heavily.

James Sullivan, head of Asia-Pacific equity research at JPMorgan, questions whether the stimulus will boost consumer demand, not just supply and investment. Hui Shan, Goldman Sachs' chief China economist, sees 2025 growth as dependent on additional stimulus and the outcome of the U.S. election.

China's National Development and Reform Commission pledges more economic support but avoids major new plans. The World Bank advocates for deeper structural reforms, rather than just stimulus, to sustain long-term growth.

Growth in the East Asia and Pacific region is expected to rise to 4.9% next year, but as China's growth slows, the region must find new drivers of growth. For decades, China's growth has benefited its neighbors; now, that momentum is fading.

NASA's Europa Clipper, the largest spacecraft designed for planetary missions, has been moved to SpaceX's hangar at Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39A. The spacecraft, encapsulated in a payload fairing for protection, will be mounted on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket.

The fairing shields the spacecraft from aerodynamic pressures and heat during launch, eventually detaching and falling back to Earth. Soon, technicians will align the spacecraft with the rocket, prepare for launch, and then roll the rocket to the pad, elevating it vertically before liftoff.

Scheduled for October 10 at 12:31 PM EDT, the mission aims to explore Jupiter's icy moon Europa, assessing its potential to support life. The solar-powered Europa Clipper will orbit Jupiter, making nearly 50 close flybys of Europa to capture high-resolution images and data of its icy shell and subsurface ocean.

Led by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and managed by Caltech, the mission collaborates with Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Project management is overseen by NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, with launch operations managed by NASA's Launch Services Program at Kennedy Space Center.

Each component works in harmony to prepare for this mission, which promises to unveil the mysteries beneath Europa's icy surface and its potential for extraterrestrial life.

  alt="Birkenstock: The Rise of the 'Ugly' Shoe Trend"
/>

Early autumn saw Birkenstock shoes unexpectedly gain popularity. On Douyin, the topic "Crocs Retire, Birkenstock Take Over" went viral. The German brand Birkenstock, with its century-long history, especially caught the public's eye. Its iconic toe-capped sandals, though deemed ugly, are expensive, opening up the "ugly shoe" market. In 2023, Birkenstock's sales exceeded 10 billion yuan. A Beijing store is in the works, and it is now known alongside Crocs and UGG as the "Three Kings of Ugly Shoes."

Birkenstock originated in Germany in 1774 and was once exclusive to royalty and nobility. In the 19th century, Konrad Birkenstock innovated the shoe design, laying the foundation for the Birkenstock brand. In the 1970s and 1980s, it became a staple among hippies. In 2021, LVMH's fund acquired a 70% stake, and in 2023, Birkenstock went public on the NYSE with a market value exceeding 63 billion yuan.

Birkenstock is known for its relaxed feel and practicality, often referred to as the "fashionable version of Zulijian." 70% of American consumers own at least two pairs, with an average of 3.6 pairs per person. A pair of Birkenstock Arizona sandals once worn by Steve Jobs was auctioned off for 1.55 million yuan.

In the Chinese market, Birkenstock has set up flagship stores on WeChat Mini Program, Tmall, JD.com, and Douyin. The best-selling model on Tmall is priced at 1,299 yuan, with over 20,000 people adding it to their carts. The third-quarter 2024 financial report showed a 36% surge in revenue in the Asia-Pacific, Middle East, and Africa markets.

The "ugly shoe" trend reflects a new generation's consumption attitude: seeking relaxation, individuality, and comfort. "Ugly shoes" provide emotional value and have become part of fashion trends. The middle class uses them as a brief escape to achieve self-satisfaction. The consumer retail industry is ever-changing, and seizing the moment is crucial.

### Rising Food Insecurity Leading to Scurvy Cases in Canada

Canadian doctors are being alerted to watch for scurvy, a disease once associated with sailors, due to rising food insecurity. A recent case study in the Canadian Medical Association Journal highlights a 65-year-old woman diagnosed with scurvy in Toronto. She lived on a diet of canned soup, tuna, white bread, and processed cheese, lacking fresh produce.

Scurvy results from severe vitamin C deficiency. Symptoms include fatigue, bruising, bleeding gums, and red hair follicles. Untreated, it can lead to internal bleeding and death. The study emphasizes that scurvy is not an archaic diagnosis, noting 52 hospitalized patients with low vitamin C levels between 2009 and 2017, 13 of whom were diagnosed with scurvy.

Food insecurity, driven by low income, forces people to skip meals or eat nutritionally poor food. Recent U.S. research shows a tripling of scurvy cases among children from 2016 to 2020. In the U.K., studies reveal vitamin C deficiencies in low-income households.

Health professionals warn that food insecurity exacerbates chronic illnesses like cardiovascular disease and mental health conditions. Statistics Canada reports 16.9% of Canadians faced moderate or severe food insecurity in 2022, up from 12.9% in 2021.

This article underscores the need for doctors to consider scurvy, especially among vulnerable populations, and highlights the broader health impacts of food insecurity.

China's new tea beverage industry has grown over the past decade, with a market size nearing 200 billion yuan, and a high rate of chain store penetration among food and beverage categories. However, competition in the "10,000-store era" is intensifying, forcing brands to choose between fighting for market share in lower-tier cities or going global.

Southeast Asia has become the preferred destination for new tea beverage brands going overseas, often referred to as the "Jerusalem" of this industry. The success of brands like CHAGEE and Mixue Bingcheng in Malaysia and Indonesia demonstrates the effectiveness of both high-end and mass-market approaches. CHAGEE integrates tea culture with offline spaces, while Mixue Bingcheng wins with high cost-effectiveness and catchy marketing.

The Southeast Asian tea beverage market lags behind China by 5-10 years, making the time machine theory applicable here. Chinese brands, leveraging their first-mover advantage and mature supply chains, have quickly captured the market. Mixue Bingcheng, utilizing resources from the OV system, has adopted an aggressive franchising strategy, resulting in over 4,000 stores.

However, Taiwanese tea brands and local Southeast Asian brands are also stepping up their efforts. Although Taiwanese brands have declined in mainland China, they still hold competitive positions in Southeast Asia. Local brands like Estch Indonesia and Haus are rising rapidly, employing low-price strategies.

While new tea beverage brands face multiple challenges in expanding to Southeast Asia, they are expected to continue growing, thanks to creative marketing, supply chain advantages, and the time machine theory. The Southeast Asian market holds significant potential, and future competition is likely to become even more intense.
