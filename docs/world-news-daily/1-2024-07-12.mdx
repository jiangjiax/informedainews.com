# World News Daily(2024-07-12) : Helsing Raises $487M for AI Defense Expansion in Baltic Region

## Helsing Raises $487M for AI Defense Expansion in Baltic Region

Helsing, a defense AI firm, has just raised $487 million. They are expanding into Estonia with the aim of strengthening defenses against Russia. This move aligns with NATO's concerns over the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Helsing's technology enhances drone and jet fighter capabilities and assists in battlefield decision-making. They have partnered with Airbus and several defense ministries.

Gundbert Scherf, co-CEO of the company, views their technology as essential for defending European democracies. Estonia's Prime Minister, Kaja Kallas, welcomes Helsing's presence.

Torsten Reil, Helsing's co-CEO, emphasizes the urgency to create a "capability gap" to deter and defend against potential broader threats.

The firm utilizes its own compute resources and some from unnamed third parties for security reasons. They are also working on Project Centaur, an AI for air combat that employs reinforcement learning.

This latest funding values Helsing at approximately $5.4 billion. Investors include Spotify's Daniel Ek and Saab AB.

Defense technology is gaining momentum with Western investors, reflecting increasing defense budgets. Helsing stands out as a significant European player in this field.

Dutch researchers discovered coordinated disinformation networks that inundated social media in France, Germany, and Italy prior to the EU elections. These accounts, many established following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, experienced rapid follower growth.

Trollrensics, a consultancy, examined 2.3 million posts from 468,000 accounts and identified 50,000 as disinformation spreaders. In France, 20% of posts about Éric Zemmour originated from these accounts, while in Germany, 10% of posts about Alternative für Deutschland were from them.

The networks could control debates by overwhelming platforms with posts, reposts, comments, and likes. Accounts were closely interconnected, likely operated by humans. An example, Leila Ruth 888, managed 13 accounts from various locations, with some posting in Russian.

These accounts strive to appear legitimate by swiftly gaining followers. Their primary tactic is to sow doubt and discredit Western authorities, a narrative associated with Russia.

Robert van der Noordaa, co-founder of Trollrensics, noted that consistent, localized endorsements on social media can be more persuasive than corporate advertising.

The UN predicts global population will peak at 10.3 billion by mid-2080s, then drop to 10.2 billion by century's end. This is lower than earlier forecasts, offering hope for reduced environmental strain.

Sixty-three countries have already hit their population peak; another 48 will by 2054. Meanwhile, nine countries, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, expect their populations to double by 2054.

Fertility rates are down globally, with over half of countries seeing women bear fewer than 2.1 children each. This is below the replacement rate needed to maintain population levels without migration.

Life expectancy is rising, with under-five deaths dropping below 5 million in 2023. By 2054, average life expectancy is projected to be 77 years, up from 73 now.

Immigration will drive population growth in many countries, especially in the latter half of the century in places like Australia, Canada, and the US.

The report emphasizes the need to curb teenage pregnancies and adapt to changing demographics to minimize environmental impacts.

### Biden Administration Funds Major EV Production Expansion

The Biden administration is allocating nearly $1.1 billion to General Motors and Stellantis. This funding is intended to transform outdated plants into electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing facilities. The Department of Energy is spearheading this initiative, with a total of $1.7 billion designated for 11 plants in eight states.

The objective is to produce a million EVs annually, preserve 15,000 jobs, and create 3,000 new positions. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm views this as a pivotal component of Biden's industrial strategy, aimed at modernizing conventional auto plants.

General Motors receives $500 million to convert its Lansing Grand River Assembly Plant in Michigan. Stellantis is awarded $334.8 million for its Belvidere Assembly plant and $250 million for its Indiana Transmission Plant, both slated for EV production.

Other companies are also benefiting from this initiative. Hyundai Mobis, Harley-Davidson, Blue Bird, and Cummins are all receiving funds to enhance their EV capabilities.

The Department of Energy must still conclude negotiations and conduct environmental reviews before the funds are disbursed. However, the plan is evident: to steer America towards greater electrification and reduced emissions.

Neuralink's brain implant, after a shaky start, is now stable in its first patient. The device, named Telepathy, uses thin wires to connect the brain to a computer interface. These wires, thinner than a human hair, capture brain signals and translate them into actions, allowing paralyzed patients to control digital devices with their thoughts.

The implant had issues—wires detached and air trapped in the patient's head. To fix this, Neuralink plans to sculpt the skull to reduce gaps and tension on the wires. They also aim to normalize blood carbon dioxide levels.

Elon Musk, Neuralink's CEO, announced they'll test the implant on a second patient soon. He hopes to have several participants this year. The FDA approved human trials last year, despite initial safety concerns.

Neuralink is developing a more efficient device requiring fewer electrodes. They're also working on Blindsight, a product aimed at restoring vision to the blind.

New research from Copenhagen and Gothenburg universities suggests that the plague, which later devastated Europe in the 14th century, may have significantly impacted populations much earlier, around 5000 years ago.

Analyzing DNA from 108 ancient individuals in Swedish passage graves, researchers found that 18 (17%) had died from the plague. This challenges previous beliefs that the plague only caused major epidemics in the Middle Ages.

The study, employing a method known as "deep shotgun sequencing," enabled detailed analysis of degraded ancient DNA. It revealed a detailed lineage of the plague and other microbes, providing insights into societal structures and diseases of the time.

This discovery suggests that the plague could have been a key factor in the decline of Neolithic populations in Scandinavia and northwest Europe.

### NFL Considers Allowing Private Equity Stakes in Teams

  alt="NFL Considers Allowing Private Equity Stakes in Teams"

The NFL is considering allowing private equity firms to hold up to 10% stakes in its teams. Commissioner Roger Goodell views this as a necessary policy update to align with the changing economics of sports. The league plans to finalize these adjustments by the end of the year.

Traditionally, the NFL has avoided institutional investments, in contrast to other major U.S. sports leagues that permit up to 30% private equity ownership. This change is occurring as NFL franchise values skyrocket due to lucrative media contracts, making complete ownership feasible only for the extremely wealthy.

Josh Harris, co-founder of Apollo Global Management, spearheaded a $6.05 billion acquisition of the Washington Commanders in 2023, setting a record for U.S. sports franchises. His ability to raise such substantial capital indicates a possible reassessment of NFL ownership structures.

Private equity firms, which seek high returns, may be drawn to minority stakes. Such investments usually entail limited decision-making authority, which fits with the NFL's desire to keep control in the hands of current owners.

Ultimately, the NFL's embrace of private equity could represent a strategic financial strategy, balancing the infusion of new capital with the maintenance of traditional ownership patterns.

England's football team, led by Gareth Southgate, has once again reached the final of the European Championship. They secured their place by defeating the Netherlands thanks to a late goal from Ollie Watkins. This achievement marks their second consecutive final appearance.

Reflecting on his role, Southgate discussed his commitment to enhancing English football and providing unforgettable moments for the fans. The team is set to face Spain in the final, with the goal of capturing their first major trophy since 1966.

The path to the final has been challenging. England faced deficits in both the quarter-final and semi-final but demonstrated remarkable resilience. Jude Bellingham's crucial goal against Slovakia and their victory in a penalty shootout against Switzerland underscore their determination.

Criticism, including discontent from fans during a draw with Slovenia in the group stage, has been a part of their journey. Southgate acknowledged these difficulties but emphasized the team's accomplishments.

Real Madrid's Bellingham and Manchester United's Kobbie Mainoo, aged 19, have been exceptional performers. Mainoo, in particular, made history by becoming the youngest player to appear in a major tournament semi-final for England.

The team is resolute in their pursuit of victory, aiming to secure a place in history with a win.

In a study for the 2024 Paris Olympics, researchers identified six key pathogens to monitor through wastewater. These include poliovirus and SARS-CoV-2. The selection was based on practicality and relevance, establishing a precedent for future large events.

The French National Institute of Public Health spearheaded this research, aiming to identify critical pathogens during the Olympics and Paralympics. They employed the Delphi method, combining reviewed evidence and expert opinions, to choose these pathogens based on their analytical feasibility, relevance to the Olympics, and public health significance.

Wastewater surveillance (WWS) gained prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is non-invasive, cost-effective, and provides data regardless of symptoms or testing behavior. This makes it a valuable early warning system.

The selected pathogens are poliovirus, influenza A and B, measles, SARS-CoV-2, and another strain of measles. These were chosen based on three criteria: analytical feasibility, relevance to the 2024 Paris Olympics, and their impact on public health policy.

Initially, a list of 60 pathogens was compiled. This was narrowed down to 25 based on evidence from reviewed publications. A panel of 32 experts further refined this list, reaching a 70% consensus. Measles, initially excluded, was added due to its resurgence and potential risk during the Olympics.

WWS is not new but has gained momentum post-COVID-19. This study sets a framework for targeting WWS in large gatherings. If successful, it could encourage similar strategies in future events.

Further work is needed before implementing this strategy at the 2024 Paris Olympics. This includes optimizing lab methods and refining sampling strategies. The plan is to use a network of 54 sites across France to monitor SARS-CoV-2 and pilot the monitoring of measles and influenza viruses in Paris's wastewater.

China's latest food safety scandal erupted days before a crucial party meeting. State-run Beijing News exposed fuel tankers used to transport cooking oil without proper cleaning. These tankers, previously carrying coal-derived fuel, traveled over 800 miles from Ningxia to Qinhuangdao, loading soybean oil without disinfection.

The scandal implicates major firms like Sinograin and Hopefull Grain and Oil Group. Both claim to be investigating. The food safety commission promises severe punishment for law violations. Regulations mandate separate tankers for fuel and cooking oil, highlighting a gap in enforcement.

The Beijing News report suggests contaminated oil might reach consumers, packaged under household brands, even exported. Public outrage is high, fueled by past scandals like the 2008 baby formula tragedy and the 2013 Huangpu River dead pigs incident.

Journalistic exposure of this scandal contrasts with a decade of shrinking independent reporting space in China. Hashtags and mentions of specific companies on Weibo, China's Twitter, face censorship. Jinlongyu, a implicated brand, saw its parent company's shares drop 8%, despite claims of compliance.
