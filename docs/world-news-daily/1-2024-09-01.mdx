# World News Daily(2024-09-01) : North Korean IT Spies: A Threat to Global Cybersecurity

## North Korean IT Spies: A Threat to Global Cybersecurity

North Korea deploys IT workers under false identities to infiltrate Western firms, primarily in the U.S. These operatives secure remote jobs, often through freelance contracts, to gain access for cyber espionage and financial gain. The U.S. Treasury warned in 2022 about this tactic, highlighting the use of fake personas and third-party intermediaries to obscure their origins.

In a recent case, an Arizona woman, Christina Chapman, allegedly facilitated this scheme by hosting North Korean IT workers' computers in her home, making it appear as if they were U.S.-based. She handled payroll and laundered payments, involving over 300 companies and $6.8 million. Another participant, a Ukrainian national, Oleksandr Didenko, created fake accounts for these workers on U.S. job platforms.

Security firms like KnowBe4 and Palo Alto have reported being targeted by these North Korean operatives, who use advanced tools like AI-created deepfakes to enhance their deception. The threat extends globally, with North Korean IT workers actively seeking employment in various countries.

Countermeasures suggested include live video interviews and verifying home addresses to detect and deter these infiltrators.

China's economy is faltering. Companies are offloading excess steel and goods overseas, driving down global prices. Export prices for 60% of major products have dipped, ranging from steel to food.

Domestic demand is weakening. The purchasing managers' index, a measure of factory health, reached 49.1 in August, marking the fourth consecutive month below 50—the threshold between growth and contraction. However, exports are surging. July's $300.5 billion represented a 7% year-over-year increase, the fourth straight month of growth.

Steel is at the forefront. Prices have fallen by 9%, while exports have risen by 22% to 61.23 million tonnes in the January-July period. A real estate downturn and overproduction have created a steel surplus, inundating overseas markets.

Other nations are responding. The EU has increased duties on Chinese EVs. The U.S. is planning similar actions on EVs and steel. Brazil and Latin American countries have raised steel tariffs, fearing market loss.

China's GDP grew by 5% in the first half, meeting the annual target. However, no significant domestic stimulus has emerged. "Deflationary exports" may intensify to achieve growth targets.

This strategy is putting pressure on global markets, sparking trade tensions. China's economic challenges are spilling over, testing international trade relations.

Macao casinos are booming again, nearing pre-pandemic highs. Six major operators saw a 36% jump in revenue, totaling HK$111.71 billion. Melco, SJM, and Galaxy led the charge, despite lingering losses from debt.

Yet, the good times may be short-lived. Authorities are cracking down on unlicensed money changers, key to the casino cash flow. These changers help mainland Chinese gamblers bypass strict capital controls. A recent police raid netted 47 suspects, with proposed five-year prison terms for unlicensed operations.

The crackdown reflects Beijing's fears of capital outflows amidst economic uncertainty. Ben Lee, of Macao-based IGamiX, suggests this might just be the start of a cat-and-mouse game between regulators and the casino industry.

The clampdown has already hit casino stocks, despite strong earnings. Shares of the six operators fell between 10% and 21% since June. The future of Macao's casino boom hangs in the balance, as authorities and the industry play a high-stakes game of regulation and evasion.

Associate professors Li Tingxin and Liu Xiaoxue, a scientific couple from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, have jointly published a paper in the journal Nature. They have observed, for the first time, an electron-doped superconducting state in a heterostructure of single-crystal bilayer graphene and two-dimensional semiconductors.

Li Tingxin specializes in two-dimensional layered semiconductors, while Liu Xiaoxue is adept in graphene superconductivity. By combining their expertise, they have broken through traditional research boundaries. Through optimizing the sample preparation method, they have pushed the electric field limit to 1.6V/nm, achieving high-quality graphene samples.

This research has discovered a superconducting state at the electron end of single-crystal graphene, whereas only two global research groups had previously found a superconducting state at the hole end. The findings of Li Tingxin and Liu Xiaoxue provide a new perspective for understanding the superconducting mechanism in graphene systems.

During the research process, they faced the challenge of equipment embargoes, being unable to purchase the necessary dilution refrigerators. Nevertheless, they persisted with their research and ultimately achieved a breakthrough.

This achievement not only showcases the harmony and perseverance of the scientific couple but also opens up a new field in graphene superconductivity research.

NASA's "Endurance" rocket mission confirmed the existence of a global electric field, dubbed the "bipolar field," crucial to Earth's atmospheric dynamics. This field, theorized 60 years ago, influences how particles escape our atmosphere.

The bipolar field begins at about 150 miles above Earth, where sunlight splits atoms into electrons and ions. These charged particles interact, creating a field that counters gravity, lifting some particles into space. This process, known as the "polar wind," was observed but not fully understood until now.

"Endurance" measured this field from 477 miles up, finding it weak but potent enough to boost particles into space, particularly hydrogen ions. This effect extends the height and density of the ionosphere, a layer of our upper atmosphere.

Understanding this field not only deepens our knowledge of Earth's atmosphere but also aids in assessing the habitability of other planets. The bipolar field, being a natural outcome of atmospheric processes, is likely present on other planets like Venus and Mars.

This discovery opens new avenues for planetary science, revealing how fundamental forces shape atmospheres across the cosmos.

### Saudi Arabia Shifts Gaming Strategy with Focus on Japanese IPs

Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) is shifting its gaming strategy. Instead of merely investing, it aims to collaborate more closely with Japanese gaming companies. This move is part of a broader plan to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil and into entertainment and intellectual property (IP).

PIF will transfer all its gaming assets to Savvy Games Group, a subsidiary, as early as 2025. This transfer signifies a move from passive investment to active partnership. Savvy has been in talks with Japanese companies about expanding into the Saudi and MENA markets.

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a fan of video games and anime, is leading this initiative. The PIF already owns significant stakes in major gaming companies like Nintendo and Capcom.

Savvy's $35 billion investment plan is central to this strategy. It includes building theme parks based on popular IPs like "Dragon Ball" and "Transformers."

Japanese gaming companies could benefit from this shift. The Islamic population in the Middle East offers a large, untapped market. Additionally, soaring game development costs could be offset by Saudi funding.

While some Japanese companies are cautious, others see Saudi Arabia as a potential gateway to Middle East expansion. Savvy's cooperative stance suggests aggressive takeovers are unlikely. Despite concerns about the effectiveness of some Saudi plans and geopolitical risks, the gaming industry is watching closely.

### South Korean Deepfake Porn Incident Sparks International Concern

Recently, South Korea has experienced a surge in "deepfake" incidents involving a large number of pornographic images and videos, including those of underage girls. This technology uses AI to synthesize false content, such as voices and facial expressions.

Several Korean women have sought help on Chinese social platforms like Weibo and Xiaohongshu, hoping to amplify the issue and prompt authorities to take action. Eun-min (pseudonym), a 20-year-old, has been posting on Xiaohongshu since August 26, attempting to spread the message in English, Japanese, and Chinese to alert Chinese nationals in Korea to stay safe.

According to Korean police reports, there have been 297 cases of deepfake cyber-pornography crimes in the first seven months of this year, with 131 of the suspects being teenagers. The actual problem may be more severe than official data suggests.

The South Korean government and ruling party plan to increase the maximum sentence for such crimes from five to seven years. However, enforcement has gray areas, and merely possessing deepfake pornographic material does not necessarily lead to punishment.

Eun-min and other Korean women hope to punish the offenders and tighten regulation of social platforms. Their efforts have been met with support and encouragement from Chinese netizens.

### Impact of Pandemic on Lockdown Babies Starting School

During the pandemic, babies like Elijah and twins Aqil and Fawaz faced unique challenges. Born in lockdown, they missed crucial social interactions and support services. The Bicycle study, involving six universities, examines the long-term effects on these "lockdown babies."

Initial findings suggest a significant impact on speech and language development. Reduced family interactions and lack of access to health visitors contributed to delays. At Elizabeth Selby Infants' School, over a third of children entering reception have speech and language needs.

The school has responded by hiring a speech and language therapist, a first in its history. Yet, with many children still waiting for therapy, the need for support remains high.

The pandemic stripped families of essential services and social networks. As these children start school, the focus is on how best to support their development. The challenge is clear: rebuild what was lost, and ensure these children thrive.
