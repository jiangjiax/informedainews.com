# World News Daily(2024-06-26) : International Criminal Court Issues Arrest Warrants for Russian Officials Over War Crimes

## International Criminal Court Issues Arrest Warrants for Russian Officials Over War Crimes

The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Russian officials, including former Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of Staff Gen. Valery Gerasimov, in connection with attacks on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure. They are accused of war crimes and inhumane acts, specifically targeting electric infrastructure between October 2022 and March 2023. Additionally, a warrant has been issued for President Putin regarding child abductions. This legal action highlights a global judicial response to alleged atrocities, signaling a significant advancement in holding military leaders and heads of state accountable.

### Poland Launches 'Holidays with the Army' to Strengthen National Defense

In Poland, a new program called "Holidays with the Army" is training thousands of individuals aged 18-35 in basic military skills. Amidst heightened tensions with Russia, this initiative aims to strengthen the nation's defense. Participants, including recent high school graduates, undergo rigorous training and earn 6,000 zlotys for 28 days of service.

The program, which has attracted over 11,000 volunteers, reflects a surge in national defense sentiment following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Trainees pledge to serve Poland, even at the risk of their lives. Post-training options include joining professional armed services, Territorial Defense Forces, or becoming reservists.

This military expansion highlights a broader shift in Eastern Europe, where countries are reevaluating their security due to recent geopolitical threats. Poland, directly impacted by Russian aggression, aims to enhance its defenses, considering historical conflicts and current regional instabilities.

### Study Proposes Feasible Global Tax on Billionaires' Wealth

Summary:
A recent study by French economist Gabriel Zucman suggests that an international tax on the wealth of the world's 3,000 billionaires is technically feasible, potentially generating up to $250 billion annually. Zucman, commissioned by Brazil's G20 presidency, argues that advancements in taxing multinational corporations pave the way for a global individual wealth tax, even without universal participation. The proposal, which targets a 2% annual tax on billionaire wealth, aims to address the current low tax rate of 0.3% on their wealth, significantly less than what average workers pay. Zucman emphasizes the simplicity of valuing billionaire wealth, primarily held in shares, and proposes mechanisms like strengthened exit taxes to enforce the tax globally. The plan will be discussed at the upcoming G20 finance ministers' meeting in Rio de Janeiro.

Insights:
Zucman's proposal underscores a shift in global taxation norms, focusing on wealth concentration rather than just income. The feasibility of such a tax, despite political complexities, reflects a growing consensus on the need for equitable wealth distribution. The strategy of leveraging existing tax enforcement mechanisms, like exit taxes, demonstrates practicality in implementation. This initiative, if adopted, could redefine the global economic landscape, influencing not just tax policies but also wealth management strategies among the ultra-rich.

### Meta's Threads Expands to Fediverse: A New Era of Social Platform Interoperability

Meta's Threads, a social platform, has expanded its presence into the fediverse—a network of interconnected servers utilizing the ActivityPub protocol. Initially tested in beta across the U.S., Canada, and Japan, this feature is now accessible to Threads users aged 18 and over in more than 100 countries.

Meta is dedicated to clarifying the fediverse, providing users with insights into its workings and advantages. Threads users can now disseminate content across platforms such as Mastodon, observe likes and replies originating from the fediverse, although direct replies are currently not supported.

During this beta phase, only top-level posts and self-replies are eligible for federation, with other post formats like polls being excluded. To utilize this feature, users need to activate "Fediverse Sharing (Beta)" within their Account Settings.

Meta's approach highlights a pledge to cultivate a secure, diverse, and interoperable community within the fediverse, with the goal of boosting content visibility and community interaction. Given Threads' existing user base of over 150 million monthly active users, this integration has the potential to substantially increase the fediverse's user population.

On June 25, 2024, the Chang'e-6 return capsule successfully landed in the Siziwang Banner of Inner Mongolia, marking the complete success of China's first lunar far side sample return mission. This mission not only achieved the world's first lunar far side sampling but also set several Chinese firsts: unfurling the national flag on the lunar far side, leaving an imprint of the Chinese character "中", and capturing a full-body color standard photo.

Chang'e-6 underwent a series of complex space operations, including orbit correction, near-moon braking, lunar orbit descent, and powered descent, ultimately achieving precise landing and sampling in the pre-selected area of the South Pole-Aitken Basin on the lunar far side. During the return process, the return capsule executed two aerodynamic decelerations, ultimately safely returning to Earth.

The success of this mission not only showcases China's technological prowess in deep space exploration but also lays the foundation for future lunar scientific research and international cooperation. The scientific instruments carried by Chang'e-6 will continue to collect valuable data on the Moon and deep space in the future, advancing humanity's understanding of the universe.

Scientists have engineered plants to produce human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), crucial sugars absent in infant formula. These HMOs, vital for disease prevention and gut health, are complex and hard to synthesize traditionally.

Researchers at UC Berkeley and UC Davis genetically modified plants, enabling them to create these essential sugars. By reprogramming tobacco relatives, they successfully produced 11 known HMOs and similar compounds. This breakthrough could lead to more nutritious, affordable infant formulas, closely mimicking the benefits of breast milk.

The potential for industrial-scale production of HMOs from plants is promising, offering a cheaper alternative to microbial methods, which are currently limited and costly. This innovation aims to bridge the gap in infant nutrition, making essential breast milk components accessible to all.

### China's Durian Craze Transforming Southeast Asian Economies

  alt="China's Durian Craze Transforming Southeast Asian Economies"

Durian, once an inexpensive fruit in Southeast Asia, now commands high prices. China's growing appetite for this pungent fruit has significantly transformed local economies. Exports to China skyrocketed from $550 million in 2017 to $6.7 billion last year.

Eric Chan, a former satellite coder, profited immensely by selling durian paste, with his initial investment growing nearly 50-fold. Farmers, who were once impoverished, are now able to renovate their homes and send their children to universities overseas.

Thailand is the leading exporter of durian, followed by Malaysia and Vietnam. The cultivation area for durian in Thailand has doubled, and forests in Malaysia are being cleared to make way for new plantations.

Chinese investment has also extended into durian logistics in Thailand, controlling approximately 70% of the wholesale market, which raises concerns among local Thai businesses.

Durian, which is both expensive and deeply ingrained in local cultures, faces a paradox: while exports are booming, rising prices are frustrating local consumers. What was once a plentiful fruit is now considered a luxury.

Transporting durian to China presents challenges due to its strong odor, leading to innovative solutions such as freezing the fruit before shipping.
