US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered the Abraham Lincoln strike group, including fighter jets and navy warships, to speed up deployment to the Middle East. This move follows the assassination of senior Hamas and Hezbollah members, sparking fears of retaliatory attacks by Iran on Israel.

Austin also announced the deployment of a guided missile submarine, a rare public disclosure. This follows earlier commitments to bolster Israeli defenses with additional jets and warships.

Ismail Haniyeh, a key Hamas leader, was killed in Tehran, with Iran blaming Israel, though Israel has not claimed responsibility. The killing of Hezbollah's Fuad Shukr in Beirut further escalated tensions, raising fears of a broader Middle East conflict.

Hamas, backed by Iran, has shown reluctance to resume ceasefire negotiations, despite calls from the US, Egypt, and Qatar for talks to finalize a ceasefire and hostage release by August 15.

Israel has indicated its willingness to negotiate, but Hamas's recent statements suggest it may avoid further talks, demanding a direct implementation of previously agreed terms based on President Biden's proposal.

In Gaza, thousands fled Khan Younis after Israeli warnings of a new operation targeting regrouped Hamas militants. The city saw extensive damage earlier this year during prolonged Israeli military efforts.

Biden's three-phase ceasefire proposal, outlined in May, has faced repeated obstacles in implementation.

ASEAN's unity is showing signs of strain as Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia pursue divergent global alliances. Indonesia is eyeing membership in the OECD, Thailand is interested in both the OECD and BRICS, while Malaysia is leaning towards BRICS.

The OECD, consisting of developed nations, stands in contrast to BRICS, which represents the Global South. Indonesia, with a GDP per capita of $4,942, is closer to the economic range of BRICS, yet it seeks OECD membership for credibility and economic reform. Malaysia, with a higher GDP per capita, views BRICS as a means to diversify and reduce reliance on the dollar.

Each country's choice reflects its unique diplomatic history and current economic needs. Indonesia's past as a non-aligned leader influences its bid for OECD membership. Malaysia's strategic shift towards BRICS aims to navigate geopolitical risks. Thailand's dual pursuit balances current and future markets.

ASEAN's cohesion is under pressure as its members pursue independent paths in a rapidly changing global order.

Hollywood's past stars, such as Burt Reynolds and Judy Garland, are making a comeback through AI voice cloning. ElevenLabs, supported by major venture capital firms, enables this with its IconicVoices tool. The tool allows these stars' voices to read texts within an app but restricts exporting the voices or using them outside the app.

This technology, though controversial, is being handled through agreements with celebrity estates. It provides a controlled method to utilize AI voices, sidestepping some legal and ethical concerns. ElevenLabs collaborates with prominent publishers and was selected by Disney for its accelerator program.

Crafting a professional voice clone necessitates approximately 30 minutes of high-quality audio. The AI analyzes the actor's vocal patterns and subtleties, striving to sound identical to the real person.

Nonetheless, the technology sparks concerns. Voice actors fear their roles might be usurped or their voices used without permission. Legal disputes regarding AI voice usage are already underway.

ElevenLabs asserts that it prioritizes safety, implementing content moderation and accountability protocols. The future of AI voice technology appears promising yet intricate, with ongoing discussions about permissions, remuneration, and control.

In Settsu City, Osaka Prefecture, organic fluorine compounds were detected in groundwater at levels 400 times above the standard. A civil group conducted blood tests on over a thousand residents, and about 30% were found to be above the normal range. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are difficult to degrade and accumulate in the environment and human bodies, earning them the nickname "forever chemicals." The World Health Organization has classified two of these substances as carcinogenic or possibly carcinogenic. Abnormalities in water bodies and blood tests of residents in multiple Japanese regions are suspected to be related to U.S. military bases and Self-Defense Forces bases. The Japanese government has initiated a nationwide investigation into harmful substances in tap water.

PFAS: A class of chemicals widely used in products such as non-stick pans and waterproof clothing. Due to their persistence and accumulative nature, they pose a risk to human health.

Scientists have created a new type of insulin that adjusts to blood sugar levels in real time. This "smart" insulin could revolutionize how millions with type 1 diabetes manage their condition.

Currently, patients inject synthetic insulin up to 10 times a day. This constant need to balance blood sugar can lead to health issues and stress. The new insulin, known as glucose-responsive insulin (GRI), only activates when blood sugar is high, preventing both high and low blood sugar levels.

Researchers from the US, Australia, and China are collaborating on this project. They've received millions in funding to expedite development. The aim is to reduce the frequency of insulin injections, potentially to once a week.

This new insulin mimics the body's natural response to sugar levels. It could alleviate the daily challenges of managing diabetes and enhance overall health. The research is backed by organizations like Diabetes UK and JDRF, with the goal of achieving transformative advancements in diabetes care.

## Food

### Innovative Approaches to Reducing Sugar in Foods

Scientists at Harvard's Wyss Institute are developing a "sugar-to-fiber" enzyme. This enzyme, encased in tiny pectin cages, converts sugar to fiber in the intestine. The goal is to reduce sugar absorption by 30%. This technology could also address lactose and gluten issues. It remains costly and is better suited for solid foods.

Another approach comes from Biolumen's Monch Monch, a drink mix that uses microscopic sponges to absorb sugar in the stomach. One gram can sequester six grams of sugar. It is available online, and discussions are underway with food manufacturers.

Magic Spoon uses allulose, a natural sugar derived from figs and raisins, which does not contribute to sugar totals on labels. Tate & Lyle produces allulose from corn, and it tastes like sugar but is not metabolized.

Blommer Chocolate uses Incredo, a sugar modified to taste sweeter with a fast-dissolving mineral carrier. This allows for up to 50% less sugar in products.

Researchers are also modifying individual sugar crystals to dissolve quickly, enhancing sweetness.
