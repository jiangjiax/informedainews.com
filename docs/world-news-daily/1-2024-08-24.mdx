The Department of Justice, along with eight states, has sued software firm RealPage. They claim RealPage's tools helped landlords collude, driving up rents. Attorney General Merrick Garland bluntly stated, "Everybody knows the rent is too damn high, and we allege this is one of the reasons why."

RealPage, owned by Thoma Bravo, denies the allegations. They call the lawsuit a "distraction" from broader economic issues. The company insists its software is legally compliant and has cooperated with the DOJ.

This lawsuit marks a first: the government accusing a company of using algorithms to subvert free-market competition. Antitrust laws, according to Garland, remain relevant despite new tactics.

The case comes amid a presidential election where high housing costs are a hot topic. Democratic nominee Kamala Harris has plans to tackle rental costs, including cracking down on collusion tools used by landlords.

The White House supports fair enforcement of antitrust laws to prevent illegal collusion. National economic advisor Lael Brainard emphasized the Biden-Harris administration's commitment to ensuring no one pays higher prices due to corporate lawbreaking.

The Chinese Ministry of Public Security plans to introduce "Internet Numbers" and "Internet Certificates" to simplify online identity verification. Users can voluntarily apply for these, which are used for non-plaintext registration and identity verification, avoiding the need to repeatedly provide plaintext personal identity information. The existing authentication methods remain valid, and internet access is still possible without "Internet Numbers" or "Internet Certificates." "Internet Numbers" obscure personal information, while "Internet Certificates" are simplified digital certificates, offering a safer and more convenient option in scenarios requiring identity verification.

Crypto firms are pouring money into the 2024 U.S. elections, outspending traditional heavyweights like oil companies and banks. According to Public Citizen, a watchdog group, crypto donations make up nearly half of all corporate contributions, totaling around $119 million.

Coinbase and Ripple dominate these donations, accounting for over 80%. The funds primarily support super PACs backing pro-crypto candidates. This surge in spending reflects the industry's efforts to sway policy amid ongoing legal battles with the SEC.

Donald Trump, positioning himself as pro-crypto, has attracted significant funding from the sector. However, money flows to both parties, as control of the House, Senate, and presidency remains uncertain.

Fairshake, a leading pro-crypto super PAC, has raised over $169 million, mostly from major crypto firms. This money is being used to support candidates across party lines, aiming to influence the election outcome.

The strategy seems effective: crypto-backed candidates won 36 out of 42 primary races. However, campaign ads rarely mention crypto directly, focusing instead on traditional political issues.

This influx of funds highlights the influence of corporate money in elections, a trend exacerbated by the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision. Crypto's aggressive spending underscores its growing political clout and the challenges it poses for regulatory balance.

Helen Fisher, a biological anthropologist, lived as an Explorer—novelty-seeking, creative, independent. She crafted a personality test categorizing people into four types, each linked to specific neurochemicals. Fisher, high in dopamine, matched with John Tierney, her husband, also an Explorer.

Fisher's research delved into the biological roots of love, identifying three brain systems: sex drive, romantic love, and long-term attachment. Her studies using fMRI scans revealed that love activates brain regions similar to those in addiction.

Her work culminated in the Fisher Temperament Inventory, a test taken by over 40 million people, aiding in matchmaking. Fisher's life, full of romantic entanglements, finally settled with Tierney, whom she married at 75, maintaining separate homes.

Fisher's legacy is her scientific exploration of love, blending hard data with poetic insight, proving that understanding love's biology can enhance relationships. Her life and work underscore the complexity of human emotions and the value of scientific inquiry in unraveling them.

  alt="Venus Express Mission Reveals Dramatic Changes in Venus's Atmosphere"

Researchers using ESA's Venus Express discovered unexpected increases in H2O and HDO, water molecules with different isotopes, in Venus's middle atmosphere. The ratio of HDO to H2O surged significantly, suggesting a history of water loss and potential past habitability.

Venus, now harsh and dry, might once have had abundant water like Earth. The high HDO/H2O ratio, 120 times what's seen on Earth, indicates heavy water loss due to hydrogen's light weight, allowing it to escape into space.

A proposed mechanism for this involves sulfuric acid aerosols forming above the clouds, which then rise, heat up, and release more HDO than H2O, starting a cycle that enriches the atmosphere in deuterium.

These findings, crucial for understanding planetary habitability, were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Great Britain's solar power sector is experiencing significant growth. This summer, solar output is expected to increase by nearly 25% compared to last year. Experts forecast a 16% increase from the 2022 record, with solar generation potentially reaching 5.86 terawatt hours by August.

Solar panels function even on cloudy days, although their efficiency decreases when temperatures are too high. The government aims to triple solar capacity by 2030, while doubling onshore wind capacity and quadrupling offshore wind capacity.

Three new solar farms, approved by the Labour government, will significantly boost capacity. Another potential large-scale farm at Cottam could become the UK's largest.

The "rooftop revolution" initiative aims to install solar panels on millions of homes, thereby reducing energy bills and emissions. The CEO of Solar Energy UK highlights the rapid expansion of solar capacity.

The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero emphasizes the role of solar energy in transforming Britain into a clean energy superpower and reducing energy dependency.

**Explanation of Terms:**
- **Terawatt hours (TWh):** A unit of energy equivalent to one trillion watt hours, used to measure large quantities of electrical energy.
- **Photovoltaic cells:** Devices that directly convert sunlight into electricity.

New research from Jerusalem's Hebrew University and Believer Meats has cracked the code on affordable lab-grown meat. They've developed a continuous production method using a technique called tangential flow filtration (TFF), boosting cell count to 1300 billion per liter and achieving a 43% weight yield. This process ran for 20 days straight, daily harvesting biomass.

They also introduced a non-animal serum, priced at $0.63 per liter, sustaining high-density chicken cell growth. This innovation slashes production costs, potentially making cultured meat a mainstream option.

A hypothetical 50,000-liter facility could churn out cultured chicken at $6.20 per pound, matching organic chicken prices. This breakthrough not only promises a sustainable food future but also challenges traditional livestock farming's dominance.

Tangential flow filtration (TFF) is a method used to purify and concentrate substances, like cells, by passing them through a filter under pressure, retaining larger particles while allowing smaller ones to pass through.

### Justice Department Sues RealPage for Alleged Rent Price-Fixing

The Justice Department sued RealPage, a property management software provider, for allegedly enabling landlords to fix rents. RealPage's software shared nonpublic information, suggesting rent hikes. This scheme, violating the Sherman Act, hurt millions of renters.

Antitrust laws prevent businesses from unfairly controlling prices. The Sherman Act, a key law, bans monopolies and collusion. RealPage's actions, using software to coordinate rents, skirted these laws, leading to higher rents for tenants.

### Stock Market Surges as Powell Hints at Rate Cuts

Stocks surged Friday as Fed Chair Powell hinted at interest rate cuts. The Dow climbed 462 points, or 1.14%, closing at 41,175.08. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 also rose, by 1.47% and 1.15% respectively.

Powell's speech at Jackson Hole signaled a shift in policy, with rate cuts dependent on economic data. Traders responded positively, betting on a cut in September.

Technology stocks, notably Tesla and Nvidia, jumped over 4%. Small-cap stocks, as measured by the Russell 2000, gained more than 3%.

UBS anticipates rate cuts at the next three Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. They suggest investors consider fixed income and equity income strategies.

Former PIMCO chief economist, Paul McCulley, sees potential for 50-basis-point cuts if the August jobs report disappoints.

Market strategist David Russell believes Powell's dovish signals will support the market through year-end.

Uranium ETFs surged after Kazakhstan cut its 2025 production target, due to limited access to sulfuric acid and production delays.

### Empowering Employees: The Key to Boosting Productivity with AI

Lifting productivity in Asia requires more than AI; it needs engaged employees. The World Bank notes lagging productivity, partly due to uneven skills and weak management. AI can boost output, but only if workers are empowered to use it.

Employee experience directly impacts the bottom line. Qualtrics research shows firms that excel in understanding and responding to employee feedback see triple revenue growth and double profitability. Yet, employee engagement indicators have stagnated or declined in many Asian countries, especially in the service sector.

Improving employee experience involves better listening and timely responses to workforce needs. This goes beyond annual surveys; frequent, specific insights are crucial. Understanding employee support needs during onboarding, high-performing team characteristics, and software usage can enhance productivity.

During the COVID pandemic, frequent listening programs correlated with higher employee satisfaction and productivity. Companies must adapt engagement strategies as work evolves. Investing in adaptive employee experiences can yield significant organizational benefits.

For example, a leading sports brand doubled sales and boosted customer advocacy by 20 points through employee feedback-driven improvements. Regular training and manager feedback were key.

In short, AI alone won't solve productivity issues. Empowered, engaged employees are the real key.

### India's Persistent Issue with Women's Safety: A Call for Systemic Change

India's ongoing struggle with women's safety was starkly highlighted by the recent rape and murder of a 31-year-old doctor in Kolkata. This incident, reminiscent of the 2012 Delhi gang-rape, has sparked widespread protests and demands for systemic change.

Despite India's aspirations to global leadership, its record on gender-based violence remains grim. Rape and domestic violence are prevalent, with low conviction rates. The Supreme Court has intervened, questioning the handling of the Kolkata case and advocating for immediate protective measures.

Gender-related violence is not unique to India, but the rapid urbanization and economic growth have not translated into safer public spaces for women. Traditional customs continue to restrict women, making their safety a secondary concern.

The 1997 Supreme Court guidelines to prevent workplace harassment have been ineffectively implemented. Vrinda Grover, a lawyer and women's rights activist, criticizes the unprofessional and prejudiced approach of state authorities in handling sexual assault cases.

The ongoing protests, supported by public figures, underscore broader concerns about workplace safety for women. Gita Gopinath of the IMF emphasizes the necessity of safety for women to fully participate in the labor force.

India ranks 128th out of 177 countries in the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security's annual index, underscoring the urgent need for reform.
