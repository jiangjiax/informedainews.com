President Biden has pardoned thousands of US veterans convicted under outdated military law banning gay sex. This proclamation, issued during Pride month, aims to correct a historical injustice by allowing LGBTQ+ service members convicted solely for their sexual orientation to apply for a pardon certificate. This document will enable them to access previously withheld benefits.

The pardon covers those convicted under the Uniform Code of Military Justice article 125, which criminalized sodomy until 2013. It includes victims of the 1950s "lavender scare," where thousands of LGBTQ+ federal employees were unjustly targeted and lost their jobs.

This action not only acknowledges past wrongs but also challenges policies like "don’t ask, don’t tell," which previously governed LGBTQ+ service in the military. Biden’s initiative ensures that military culture evolves to reflect broader American values of dignity and decency.

With this pardon, eligible veterans can now seek changes to their discharge status, impacting their eligibility for Veterans Affairs benefits. The administration is committed to ensuring these veterans receive the care and benefits they have earned.

Denmark introduces the world's first tax on livestock emissions, aiming to charge 120 kroner per ton of greenhouse gases by 2030, increasing to 300 kroner by 2035. This tax targets methane, a potent greenhouse gas emitted by cattle and sheep during digestion, significantly contributing to global warming.

The revenue from this tax will support a green transition in the livestock industry, promoting cleaner farming practices. Despite early resistance, this policy shift represents a significant acknowledgment of the environmental impact of animal farming.

Although initially priced modestly, this initiative signifies a broader recognition of the need for financial incentives to reduce agricultural emissions. It challenges traditional practices, advocating for innovation and sustainability in an industry often resistant to change.

Denmark's bold move could inspire global counterparts, highlighting the importance of economic measures in combating climate change. The proposal, awaiting legislative approval, aims to cut CO2 emissions by 1.8 million tons by 2030 and establishes a significant fund for environmental restoration.

In essence, Denmark is pioneering a new era of agricultural responsibility, using economic policy to foster environmental stewardship.

### AI-Manipulated Video Targeting Biden Amplified by Russian Network

A Kremlin-linked disinformation network has amplified a video titled "Bye, Bye Biden," which portrays President Joe Biden as senile and unfit for office. This video, which has been viewed over 5 million times on platform X, shows Biden in a diaper, taking medication, and prioritizing migrants over US citizens. Created by Little Bug, a group that mimics a Russian band, the video employs AI to manipulate actors to resemble Biden, Trump, and a Russian singer.

Expert analysis indicates the use of inconsistent deepfake technology, suggesting a rushed creation. The audio is confirmed to be AI-generated, with facial manipulation also likely. Promoted by Doppelganger, a network identified by Antibot4Navalny, the video quickly spread through thousands of posts in multiple languages, facilitated by generative AI.

This manipulation highlights the growing threat of AI in disinformation campaigns, targeting public perception with unprecedented speed and reach.

YouTube, now a 20-year-old platform, has emerged as a dominant force in media consumption, surpassing traditional and streaming competitors. In May, it accounted for 9.7% of all TV viewership in the U.S., according to Nielsen, outpacing Netflix's 7.6%.

Media giants like Netflix, Disney, and Warner Bros. Discovery are navigating YouTube's dual role: a potential ally and a formidable threat. Some see it as a complementary platform, while others view it as a competitor that is eroding viewership and cultural relevance from traditional entertainment.

Disney, in particular, is closely observing YouTube due to its influence on younger audiences. The company is exploring the integration of user-generated content into Disney+ and considering more full episodes of Disney+ and Hulu series on YouTube to engage non-subscribers.

YouTube's success is highlighted by its advertising revenue, which hit $31.5 billion in 2023, marking a substantial increase from previous years. Analysts value it at $400 billion, surpassing major media conglomerates.

The challenge for traditional media is to adapt to a landscape where user-generated content and social media are central to audience engagement. The strategy moving forward involves a careful balance between utilizing YouTube's reach and safeguarding core business models.

### Lethal Mpox Strain Threatens DRC and Global Health

A lethal strain of mpox, a virus similar to smallpox, is devastating the Democratic Republic of the Congo, especially among children and pregnant women. This mutated version, stemming from clade I, shows a higher mortality rate than previous outbreaks, with transmission happening through both sexual and non-sexual contact.

The outbreak, focused in Kamituga, South Kivu, is feared to be the precursor to a broader crisis. Unlike the 2022 outbreak caused by clade II, which was managed with vaccines and treatments, the current strain's virulence and the scarcity of medical resources in the DRC present a substantial threat.

Given South Kivu's adjacency to several countries and regular cross-border activity, the possibility of international spread is concerning. Scientists and medical professionals stress the urgency of preparedness and support for local responses to avert a global health disaster.

Georgia, a newcomer to major tournaments, stunned Portugal with a 2-0 victory, securing their spot in the last 16 of Euro 2024. Khvicha Kvaratskhelia's early goal and Georges Mikautadze's penalty sealed the historic win. Despite Portugal's dominance in possession and shots, Georgia's tactical discipline and Kvaratskhelia's skill proved decisive.

The match was a classic underdog triumph, reminiscent of Wales in 2016 or Iceland's upset over England. Georgia's manager, Willy Sagnol, aptly described it as David versus Goliath. Portugal, already through to the next round, fielded a heavily rotated team, with Cristiano Ronaldo the sole regular starter. His frustration, evident in a petulant display, contrasted sharply with Georgia's spirited performance.

This victory, a testament to Georgia's resilience and tactical acumen, will be celebrated long after the tournament. Their next challenge: Spain in the last 16.
