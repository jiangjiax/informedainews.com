# World News Daily(2024-07-11) : Nato Pledges Support for Ukraine's Membership

## Nato Pledges Support for Ukraine's Membership

NATO leaders pledged an "irreversible path" to Ukraine's membership. No timeline has been set, but support remains firm. A €40 billion aid package was promised, including F-16 jets.

Jens Stoltenberg, NATO's Secretary-General, emphasized that supporting Ukraine is in NATO's security interest. The summit in Washington DC focused on Ukraine's defense against Russia.

Ukraine has made progress on reforms. Formal NATO membership awaits the fulfillment of certain conditions. Volodymyr Zelensky met with leaders, including the UK's Sir Keir Starmer and US President Joe Biden.

The summit marked NATO's 75th anniversary. Amid US political turbulence, Biden reaffirmed support and called for increased defense spending among NATO members.

### FTC Sues Major PBMs Over Alleged Medication Price Inflation

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) plans to sue three major U.S. health companies—UnitedHealth Group's Optum Rx, CVS Health's Caremark, and Cigna's Express Scripts—for inflating medication prices, including insulin. These companies, known as pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), negotiate drug prices on behalf of insurers and employers. The FTC alleges that PBMs manipulate rebates from drug manufacturers to boost their profits, driving up costs for patients.

PBMs argue that drug manufacturers set high prices, while manufacturers blame PBMs' rebates and fees for forcing price hikes. The FTC's investigation, ongoing since 2022, targets these practices. The agency's recent report accuses the largest PBMs of exploiting the drug supply chain at the expense of smaller pharmacies and patients.

The Biden administration supports increased transparency in PBM operations, aiming to make prescription drugs more affordable. The Inflation Reduction Act caps insulin prices for Medicare beneficiaries at $35 per month, though this cap does not extend to those with private insurance.

### Advancing Solutions to Homelessness: Insights from Sabrina Cohen-Hatton and Prince William

Sabrina Cohen-Hatton, once homeless, now advises Prince William on homelessness. She shared her journey from rough sleeping to a PhD and chief fire officer role. Prince William's Homewards project aims to end homelessness, challenging the notion that it's inevitable.

Homewards operates in six UK areas, focusing on prevention and support. Sabrina highlighted practical barriers like pet restrictions and confidence issues in accessing help. Prince William showed empathy, reflecting his own early life trauma.

The project collaborates with employers and Homebase for job support and furniture packs. Efforts include identifying at-risk youth and changing public attitudes. Finland's success in reducing homelessness is cited as inspiration.

Critics question a royal's role in addressing homelessness. Supporters, like George Anderson, see Prince William's high profile as beneficial. His mother, Princess Diana, also championed homelessness causes.

Homelessness remains a complex issue, but the project's approach offers hope and practical solutions.

### James Webb Telescope Reveals Detailed Insights into Black Holes and Dark Matter

The James Webb Space Telescope's image of RX J1131-1231, a quasar 6 billion light-years away, offers profound insights into black holes and dark matter. Utilizing gravitational lensing, a phenomenon predicted by Einstein, the telescope magnifies and studies the quasar. This lensing effect creates a bright arc and multiple images of the distant quasar.

The quasar's X-ray emissions suggest a rapidly spinning black hole, likely a result of galaxy mergers. This rapid spin indicates that the black hole expanded through mergers rather than random accretion events. The image, captured by Webb's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), is part of an observational program designed to unravel the mysteries of dark matter, which makes up the majority of the universe's mass.

This research delivers unprecedented detail on the evolution of black holes and the nature of dark matter. It highlights the effectiveness of gravitational lensing as a natural telescope, allowing for the observation of cosmic phenomena that would otherwise be unattainable.

### Nintendo's Cryptic 'Emio' Teaser Sparks Speculation

Nintendo released a cryptic teaser for a game named "Emio" on YouTube. The fifteen-second video shows a person wearing a trench coat and a disturbing paper bag on their head, suggesting a horror title for the Switch. The trailer's unsettling piano music and the character's missing finger deepen the intrigue.

The teaser was promoted on Twitter with "#WhoIsEmio?" and was age-restricted, which is uncommon for Nintendo. Fans are wondering if this indicates Nintendo's venture into first-party horror gaming. The trailer hints at a possible viral alternate reality game (ARG), a kind of interactive story spread across various media platforms.

Nintendo typically aims to "put smiles on faces," but "Emio" seems to turn this into something more ominous. The online response is varied, with a mix of confusion and curiosity.

### Spotify Evolves into a Social Network with Enhanced Podcast Features

Spotify is adding comments to podcasts, making it more like a social network. Users can now chat directly with podcasters. Spotify is also mimicking TikTok with a discovery feed and allowing artists to sell merchandise and tickets through their profiles.

Maya Prohovnik, Spotify's VP, hints at potentially expanding comments to artist pages, which could boost engagement due to the size and activity of music fans.

Apple attempted something similar with iTunes Ping in 2010, but it failed. Spotify is taking a more gradual approach, quietly integrating social features.

Daniel Ek, Spotify's CEO, acknowledges TikTok's influence and is learning from trends to enhance the user experience.

Artists can now post short videos, akin to Stories, providing fans with updates on new releases and events. Users can follow friends and collaborate on playlists.

Spotify aims to keep users engaged and sharing thoughts, much like traditional social networks. This shift could challenge larger social platforms for user time and ad revenue.

### Singapore Approves Insect Species for Food Diversification

Singapore has recently approved 16 insect species for human consumption, including crickets, grasshoppers, mealworms, and honeybees. The Singapore Food Agency has authorized the import of these insects to enhance food security in the land-limited city-state.

These insects must be cultivated, not wild-caught, and must be free from manure or diseased materials. Additionally, they require a heat or bactericidal treatment to ensure their safety.

This initiative is part of a larger strategy to diversify food sources, particularly in light of global challenges such as geopolitical tensions and climate change. The aim is to meet 30% of the country's nutritional needs locally by 2030.

The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization supports this transition, emphasizing the nutritional value and sustainability of insects compared to traditional livestock. Insects are rich in protein, fiber, and micronutrients such as zinc, calcium, and iron.

This decision is not merely about survival; it represents a step towards innovation. Singapore has already attracted startups, such as a Japanese silkworm producer, in anticipation of the regulatory shift.

For Singapore, this marks a bold move into a future where food is not just sustenance but a frontier of sustainable innovation.
