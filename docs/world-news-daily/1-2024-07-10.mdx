### U.S. Disrupts Russian AI-Powered Disinformation Campaign

U.S. Justice Department disrupted a Russian-backed disinformation campaign. Nearly 1,000 fake social media accounts seized. Campaign used AI to spread falsehoods about Russia's war in Ukraine.

Operation led by a senior editor at RT, a Russian state-funded media outlet. Supported financially by the Kremlin, with oversight from Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB).

Campaign aimed to sow discord in the U.S. and influence public opinion. Similar to past efforts in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

FBI Director Christopher Wray called it a first in disrupting a Russian-sponsored AI-enhanced social media bot farm.

Justice Department also seized two domain names and accounts on X, formerly Twitter.

FBI collaborated with Canadian and Dutch cyber security forces on this operation.

### Ontario Court Certifies Class-Action Lawsuit by Immigration Detainees

Ontario court green-lights class-action lawsuit against Canada's federal government by 8,360 immigration detainees. These individuals, held in provincial jails from 2016 to 2023 by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), faced conditions akin to criminal inmates, despite not being charged with crimes. Justice Benjamin Glustein dismissed the government's 15 objections.

Immigration detention, by law, is administrative, not punitive. Yet, CBSA routinely housed detainees in provincial prisons, a practice now deemed a Charter rights violation. The detainees seek $100 million in damages.

Tyron Richard, a plaintiff, endured 18 months in maximum security, subjected to numerous strip searches. He described his incarceration as "a living hell."

CBSA detains foreign nationals for reasons like being a flight risk. Over 80% of detainees were held for this reason. Most provinces have withdrawn from housing CBSA detainees, citing human rights concerns.

The lawsuit's certification means a trial will determine the outcome. The federal government has yet to comment on the decision.

A team of astronomers has made a significant discovery about LHS 1140 b, a planet located 48 light-years away. Initially believed to be a small, Neptune-like gas planet, new data from the James Webb Space Telescope now suggests it is likely a "super-Earth" with a nitrogen-rich atmosphere. This planet orbits within its star's habitable zone, where conditions might support the presence of liquid water.

LHS 1140 b is approximately 1.7 times the size of Earth and could be entirely covered in ice or possess a sub-stellar ocean beneath a cloudy atmosphere. Its potential water content is estimated to comprise 10-20% of its mass, suggesting it might be a "snowball" or "ocean" world.

The discovery, led by Charles Cadieux, utilizes data from various telescopes and is detailed in an upcoming Astrophysical Journal Letters publication. The team plans further observations to confirm the presence of an atmosphere and detect possible signs of carbon dioxide, a key indicator of habitability.

This finding is crucial as it could provide the first indirect evidence of liquid water on an exoplanet's surface, marking a significant advancement in the search for extraterrestrial life.

### FTC Report Highlights PBMs' Influence on U.S. Drug Prices

Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) control 79% of U.S. drug claims. They negotiate drug prices, decide insurance coverage, and pay pharmacies. The FTC says these middlemen inflate costs and hurt smaller pharmacies.

PBMs like Optum, CVS Caremark, and Express Scripts dominate. They often favor their own businesses, disadvantaging independents. Contracts with these PBMs can be unfair, unclear on final payments.

The FTC found PBMs negotiate rebates to limit cheaper generic drugs. This investigation started in 2022, expanded to six major PBMs. The FTC plans more scrutiny, possible regulation.

PBMs are key in drug pricing. They act between drug makers and consumers. Their power grows from market consolidation, deals between pharmacies and insurers. This gives them control over drug prices and access.

The FTC's report highlights lack of transparency. PBMs set drug coverage and prices without public accountability. This affects what drugs are available and at what cost.

The FTC's findings support more regulation. They aim to protect consumers and smaller pharmacies from PBM dominance. The investigation continues, focusing on dominant healthcare players.
