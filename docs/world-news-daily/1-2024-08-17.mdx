India plans to hold elections in Jammu and Kashmir, its only Muslim-majority region, starting September 18. This marks the first regional polls in a decade, following the revocation of the area's special autonomy in 2019. The decision aligns with a Supreme Court order demanding these polls by September 30.

Jammu and Kashmir has been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan since their 1947 independence from Britain. Both nations claim the region entirely but govern parts of it, having fought three wars, two over Kashmir.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government argues that ending Kashmir's special status has brought stability and spurred economic growth through new projects and a thriving tourism sector. However, tensions persist, with India accusing Pakistan of supporting insurgency in the region.

Despite past security threats and low voter turnout, recent parliamentary elections saw a significant increase, reaching 58.46% participation—the highest in 35 years. This surge is seen as a positive sign of local trust in the democratic process.

Trump's latest financial disclosures reveal a complex financial landscape. He made hundreds of thousands from his branded Bible and millions from properties, yet faces millions in debts from defamation and fraud cases. His global financial interests span countries like China, Saudi Arabia, and Israel.

He holds millions in cryptocurrency and a six-figure investment in gold bars. His Mar-a-Lago club income dropped by $8 million. The disclosures lack detailed financial statements, leaving his solvency unclear.

Trump's fortune rose to $6.5 billion, boosted by a Spac merger for his media group, though its value has since declined. His running mate, JD Vance, has a net worth of $4 million, including $250,000 in bitcoin.

Trump earned $12 million through licensing deals, including $7 million from NFT trading cards and $5 million in royalties from recent books. His Bible, in collaboration with singer Lee Greenwood, earned $300,000.

He supports cryptocurrencies and holds between $1 and $5 million in Ethereum. His son Eric is also involved in crypto. Melania Trump earned $237,500 from a speaking engagement and $330,000 from NFTs.

Changes in Trump's real estate empire include dissolving three Chinese companies related to real estate deals and paying off a Deutsche Bank mortgage on his Chicago hotel.

Indonesia's President Joko "Jokowi" Widodo presided over the country's 79th Independence Day ceremony in Nusantara, the future capital. This event signified a significant step in the government's plan to relocate the capital from Jakarta.

Approximately 1,400 guests participated in the scaled-down ceremony at the new State Palace. The event featured a flag-raising, a military parade, a flypast, and cultural performances. Attendees included state officials, politicians, business leaders, and construction workers involved in the $29.7 billion project slated for completion in 2045.

Local residents voiced optimism about the development, highlighting improvements in infrastructure and job opportunities. The government trimmed the guest list from 8,000 due to construction delays and investment shortfalls.

Vice President Ma’ruf Amin led a simultaneous ceremony in Jakarta. Jokowi stressed the importance of tangible progress on the ground before officially relocating the capital. President-elect Prabowo Subianto, who will take office on October 20, vowed to continue the project, aiming for completion within three to five years.

Nusantara, still under construction, is transforming from a eucalyptus plantation into a modern administrative center. New palaces, ministry towers, and residential complexes are emerging, with some bureaucrats scheduled to move in next month.

NASA's DART mission, which involved colliding with Dimorphos, tested asteroid deflection techniques. Post-impact studies revealed the geology and history of the Didymos system. Key findings include: Dimorphos likely separated from Didymos, its surface is young and fragile, which facilitated DART's orbital adjustment.

Images from DART and LICIACube displayed Dimorphos's rugged landscape and Didymos's smoother, older surface. Analysis indicates that Dimorphos may have formed from Didymos's debris, influenced by rotational forces and mass loss events.

Further research detailed the asteroids' surface materials, internal structures, and formation processes. Notably, thermal fatigue rapidly deteriorates Dimorphos's boulders, changing its surface more quickly than anticipated.

DART's success confirms kinetic impact as an effective defense against asteroid threats. The upcoming ESA's Hera mission will revisit the site in 2026, enhancing our understanding and planetary defense strategies.

TOKYO — In the April-June quarter, 70% of surveyed Japanese companies exceeded their profit forecasts. The weak yen and robust foreign demand were the main drivers.

Toyota's net profit increased by 2% to 1.33 trillion yen, contrary to a forecasted 7% decline. The yen's depreciation against the dollar enhanced Toyota's profit by 370 billion yen.

Honda and Suzuki also profited from the weak yen, with net profits exceeding expectations.

Hitachi's net profit surged 150% to 175.3 billion yen, fueled by strong demand in the AI and IT sectors.

Tokyo Electron's net profit leaped 96% to 126.1 billion yen, due to robust sales of semiconductor equipment.

Nissan and JFE Holdings performed poorly, affected by fierce competition in the U.S. and weak demand in China.

Overall, 60% of companies on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's Prime market experienced a year-on-year profit increase.

The impact of the weak yen on Japanese companies is evident: those with significant overseas exposure flourished, while those heavily dependent on domestic or specific foreign markets faced challenges. The gap between the winners and losers is pronounced, underscoring the significance of global market dynamics and currency fluctuations in today's business environment.

The International Finance Corp., part of the World Bank Group, increased its Asia-Pacific investments by 10-15% in fiscal 2024. Riccardo Puliti, the regional VP, noted a $11 billion commitment to 108 projects. This includes a $100 million package for Epic Group, a Hong Kong-based apparel manufacturer, aiding their operations in Bangladesh and India.

Puliti highlighted the urgent need to address climate change, sustainable growth, and food security in Asia. The region's heavy reliance on coal underscores the criticality of energy transition and mitigation efforts, especially in vulnerable countries like Bangladesh and Indonesia.

Attracting private sector investment remains challenging due to unclear legal and regulatory frameworks. Puliti suggests public institutions should take higher risks to set an example for private investors. He also advocates for World Bank Group collaboration with governments on reforms.

Despite financial market volatility and geopolitical uncertainties, Puliti remains optimistic about blue bonds—financial instruments aimed at promoting sustainable maritime resource use. He sees Asia as a promising market for these bonds, given the region's significant ocean plastic issue.

The IFC has already invested in blue bonds, including a $25 million subscription to Vietnam's first blue bond through SeABank. Puliti discussed the potential of blue bonds with Japanese banks during his recent visit.

Scientists from the U.S. and Israel have solved a mystery that intrigued Charles Darwin: plants move. Not in the way animals do, but by growing in spirals and zigzags. This slow and subtle behavior helps them find sunlight.

Orit Peleg and Yasmine Meroz led a study using time-lapse videos and computer simulations. They discovered that sunflower seedlings, growing in circles, use these movements to track the sun. This isn't random; it's a strategy to maximize light exposure.

The research, published in Physical Review X, suggests that controlled movements in plants are crucial for their survival. These findings could lead to improved farming techniques, optimizing crop growth.

Darwin, even in his later years, was fascinated by plant movements. He observed and documented these behaviors, though he couldn't explain them. Now, with modern technology, we understand that these movements are not chaotic but are essential for plant growth.

In essence, plants, through slow, deliberate movements, adapt to their environment, ensuring their survival. This research not only solves an old mystery but also opens new avenues for agricultural science.
