  alt="Andes Glaciers Shrink to Historic Lows Amid Global Warming"
/>

Researchers at Wisconsin's Madison University have discovered that the glaciers in the tropical Andes are the smallest they have been since the last ice age, which ended 11,700 years ago. This reduction signifies a significant milestone in the effects of global warming.

These glaciers, located high in the Andes, are melting faster than snow can replenish them. Satellite imagery and ground-based observations corroborate this continuous decline. The scientists examined exposed bedrock near the edges of glaciers, analyzing isotopes within quartz crystals to estimate past ice coverage. The low levels of these isotopes, specifically beryllium-10 and carbon-14, indicate recent exposure due to melting rather than erosion.

This study suggests that tropical glaciers, predominantly in the Andes, are shrinking at rates beyond historical norms. Shaun Marcott, a lead researcher, compares these glaciers to "canaries in a coal mine," serving as early indicators of broader climate impacts. He cautions that the situation in the Andes could presage similar losses in other glacier regions, such as the American West.

**Explanation of Terms:**
- **Isotopes:** Variants of a chemical element with different numbers of neutrons, which affect their atomic weight.
- **Beryllium-10 and Carbon-14:** These isotopes accumulate in rocks exposed to the surface, providing a timeline of when the rocks were last uncovered.

The future of ASEAN hinges on digital trade. Over 71 million MSMEs must leverage this for growth. The digital economy here could triple to $1 trillion by 2030. Success depends on public-private collaboration.

Public sector initiatives like the ASEAN Digital Economy Framework Agreement (DEFA) aim to integrate the region digitally. Yet, real change requires more trust and simpler systems. Customs clearance, often a bottleneck, needs streamlining. A common data platform could ease this, making transactions paperless and faster.

Singapore and Thailand have digitized their customs, setting a precedent. The challenge is for the rest of ASEAN to follow and integrate these systems regionally.

MSMEs see digital platforms as a gateway to wider markets. Air transport, the fastest option, is crucial for regional trade. Speed and cost are no longer luxuries but basic requirements for business growth.

ASEAN must commit to digital transformation. This involves everyone in the ecosystem. Enhanced digital capabilities will integrate cross-border trade, benefiting the entire region. A borderless economy awaits, promising growth and efficiency.

Researchers utilized high-resolution electron microscopes to create a detailed map of a small section of the human brain, measuring just one cubic millimeter. This tiny sample contained over 57,000 cells and nearly 150 million synapses. The map reveals intricate details about the types of cells and their connections, emphasizing the complexity of the brain.

The team dissected the brain tissue into 5,000 slices and captured images of each. The accumulated data reached 1.4 petabytes, a colossal volume. Using this data, they reconstructed a 3D image encompassing almost every cell in the sample.

Analysis showed that the majority of cells were either neurons, responsible for transmitting signals, or glial cells, which support neurons. Glial cells were found to be twice as numerous as neurons. The most prevalent glial cell type, oligodendrocytes, offers structural support and electrical insulation to neurons.

The study also revealed new structural details, such as mirrored orientations in specific neurons. Machine learning was instrumental in identifying nearly 150 million synapses, the points where signals transfer from one cell to another. Some neurons established multiple synapses with the same target cell, suggesting robust connections.

This research highlights the brain's complexity at the cellular level and the significance of connectomics—the mapping of brain cell connections. The data is now accessible to the public, providing valuable resources for further research.

The collaboration among neuroscientists, computer scientists, and engineers was crucial for this breakthrough. It represents a significant step towards creating a comprehensive map of the human brain, with the goal of advancing treatment possibilities.

NH Foods, a Japanese meat processor, is set to introduce a foie gras substitute made from chicken liver to European markets. The product, dubbed "Gras Foie," aims to offer an ethical alternative to traditional foie gras, which is produced by force-feeding ducks and geese.

The company plans to start selling Gras Foie in Europe this year on a trial basis, with full-scale production slated for 2027. Initial markets include France and Spain, known for high foie gras consumption.

Gras Foie combines chicken liver with pork fat and plant-based oil to replicate the taste of foie gras. It was first launched in Japan in 2023 through crowdfunding, achieving five times the sales target.

The product is currently available in Japan via NH Foods' online store and is gaining traction among commercial clients like restaurants and hotels. A four-pack with a special sauce sells for 3,218 yen, significantly cheaper than real foie gras.

NH Foods aims to reduce food waste by utilizing chicken liver, which is often used as animal feed. The company has secured a patent for Gras Foie in Japan and seeks international patents as it expands globally.

The convenience of preparation is a key selling point. Unlike traditional foie gras, which requires careful cooking to avoid melting the fat, Gras Foie is designed to be easier to prepare.

NH Foods envisions replacing all foie gras with Gras Foie worldwide.
