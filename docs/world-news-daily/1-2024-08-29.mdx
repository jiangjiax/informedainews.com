# World News Daily(2024-08-29) : Biden and Xi to Speak Amid U.S.-China Diplomatic Efforts

## Biden and Xi to Speak Amid U.S.-China Diplomatic Efforts

U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping plan to talk soon. This follows U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan's visit to Beijing, his first as advisor. Sullivan met with China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi.

Both nations agreed on military talks and are planning AI discussions. John Podesta, a climate policy advisor, will also visit China.

Despite these talks, tensions remain over tech restrictions, Taiwan, the South China Sea, and Ukraine.

Biden, not seeking re-election, will pass the nomination to Vice President Kamala Harris. Her advisor, Phil Gordon, highlighted the broader "China challenge," emphasizing the need to limit Beijing's technological and military advancements.

Sullivan's trip marks the first by a U.S. national security advisor since 2016. The visit aims to ease strained relations, impacted by previous incidents like the "balloon incident" and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi's Taiwan visit.

### US Diplomatic Credibility Under Scrutiny Amid Global Distrust

Iran's Supreme Leader Khamenei advises President Pezeshkian to negotiate with the US but warns against trusting them. Iran's distrust of the US stems from Trump's 2018 withdrawal from the JCPOA, the Iranian nuclear deal, and Biden's refusal to return in 2022. Iran's nuclear program has advanced significantly since the JCPOA.

The credibility of the US is globally questioned. NATO expanded eastward despite assurances given to Gorbachev. Glaspie's comments to Saddam Hussein prior to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait were misinterpreted as US neutrality.

Countries are skeptical of US promises. Over 40 nations are seeking BRICS membership to escape Western financial systems. The Iranian nuclear deal is nearly irrelevant given Iran's advanced enrichment capabilities.

US sanctions are losing their effectiveness. Russia's economy grew despite Western sanctions. Countries like Iran and Russia are adapting, becoming more self-sufficient. The rise in BRICS and SCO memberships is leading to de-dollarization, undermining the US's economic power.

### South Korea's Climate Law Ruled to Violate Future Generations' Rights

  alt="South Korea's Climate Law Ruled to Violate Future Generations' Rights"
/>

South Korea’s Constitutional Court has ruled that parts of its climate law fail to protect future generations, marking Asia’s first significant climate litigation ruling. The court found the law deficient in setting long-term greenhouse gas reduction targets for the period 2031-49, which it deemed a violation of future generations’ rights and an undue burden on them. The government is now required to amend the law by February 2026 to include these targets.

The legal battle commenced in 2020 when Youth 4 Climate Action, part of the global school climate strike movement, filed a lawsuit against the government for its inadequate targets. The lawsuit eventually grew to include 255 plaintiffs of various ages, including even a fetus.

The court upheld the government’s 2030 target of a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 2018 levels, considering it adequate.

While the plaintiffs expressed mixed feelings about the ruling, they acknowledged its progressive stance in addressing the climate crisis. This decision is anticipated to influence climate litigation and policy in other Asian countries such as Japan and Taiwan.

### Finland's Pioneering Solution for Nuclear Waste Management

Finland's Onkalo, the world's first geological nuclear waste repository, is set to begin operations within the next few years. Located deep beneath the forests of southwest Finland, this facility will store spent nuclear fuel in durable copper canisters, encased in bedrock over 400 meters below ground.

The project, managed by Posiva, a Finnish company jointly owned by nuclear power company TVO and utility Fortum, marks a significant milestone in nuclear waste management. Onkalo, named after a Finnish word for a small cave, is designed to isolate nuclear waste from human contact for 100,000 years.

The initiative has sparked global interest, with many viewing it as a model for sustainable nuclear energy. Despite debates over the long-term safety of nuclear waste and the role of nuclear power in combating climate change, Onkalo's approach offers a concrete solution to a pressing environmental and technological challenge.

Gareth Law, a professor of radiochemistry at the University of Helsinki, praised the project as a "big milestone" for Finland and the international nuclear industry. He noted that while many countries are still in the planning stages, Finland is "at least a decade ahead" in implementing a safe and robust method for nuclear waste disposal.

The Onkalo project is based on the KBS-3 method, a multi-barrier principle developed by the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company. This method employs several engineered barriers to ensure the long-term safety of spent nuclear fuel, making it a pioneering approach in the field of nuclear waste management.

New research on the Cascadia Subduction Zone, a 600-mile fault line off the west coast of North America, suggests a major earthquake is imminent. This fault, where the Pacific Plate dives under the continent, periodically locks and then releases massive stress, causing powerful earthquakes and towering tsunamis.

The last big quake hit in 1700. Scientists now map the fault's complex structures, aiming to predict where and how severe the next quake might be. They've discovered the fault isn't a single, continuous break but is segmented, which could affect the quake's intensity.

One segment, stretching from Vancouver Island to Washington, appears particularly dangerous due to its smooth, uninterrupted nature and shallow angle of subduction. This could mean a more severe quake directly affecting land, especially around Seattle and Tacoma.

The research, funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation, uses advanced sonar to image the seafloor. This data helps refine models for earthquake and tsunami risks, potentially guiding future building codes and warning systems.

Scientists continue to analyze these findings, with implications for coastal safety expected soon. The complexity of the fault demands careful study to prepare for the inevitable next seismic event.

Nvidia's latest earnings report shows $30.04 billion in revenue, a 122% increase from last year. The company's market capitalization stands at $3.1 trillion, making it the third largest globally. Its stock has risen by 167% over the past year.

Earnings per share were $0.68, exceeding analysts' expectations of $0.64. Nvidia also announced a $50 billion stock buy-back plan.

Nvidia's GPUs play a critical role in AI development, with major tech companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Google relying on its chips. The growing demand for AI is driving increased capital spending.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives describes Nvidia's earnings as "the most important week for the stock market this year." He estimates that every $1 spent on Nvidia's GPU chips yields an $8-$10 multiplier effect.

Annual investment in AI totals $100 billion, but profits have yet to be realized. Nvidia's next-generation AI chips, Blackwell, have been delayed by several months.

The US Department of Justice has launched an antitrust investigation into Nvidia, following accusations from rival chipmakers that Nvidia is abusing its market dominance.

Investors are drawing parallels between the current AI boom and the late 1990s Internet bubble. However, Ives contends that the situation is more similar to 1995, before the bubble burst.

### Scientists Identify Key Molecules in Long-Term Memory Formation

Scientists have long sought the key to memory's endurance. The hunt led to PKMzeta, a protein thought crucial for memory retention. Block it, and memories fade. Yet, PKMzeta's lifespan is brief, unlike memories that can last decades.

New research points to KIBRA, another molecule, as PKMzeta's partner. KIBRA tags synapses activated by learning. PKMzeta then strengthens these tagged connections. Together, they maintain memory. Block their interaction, and long-term potentiation—the strengthening of synapses—crumbles.

This discovery shifts the focus from a single memory molecule to a dynamic duo. Memories, it seems, are not anchored by one element but by a persistent partnership.

Some memories, like fear linked to a location, operate outside this system. The puzzle of memory's glue remains incomplete, with more pieces to find.

### Climate Crisis Amplifies Typhoon Gaemi's Fury

Typhoon Gaemi struck hard in July, causing extensive flooding in the Philippines, Taiwan, and China's Hunan province. Over 100 people were killed, and millions were affected. Winds reached speeds of 145 mph, sinking ships, and floods in Manila rose to building-high levels.

Scientists from the World Weather Attribution (WWA) attribute Gaemi's ferocity to global heating, caused by the burning of fossil fuels. Wind speeds increased by 9 mph, and rainfall was 14% higher. Hot sea temperatures, a key factor in cyclone strength, are linked to the climate crisis.

Dr. Ben Clarke of Imperial College London warns of larger, more deadly typhoons in the future unless we transition to renewable energy. Dr. Friederike Otto adds that reducing inequality and protecting the vulnerable is crucial.

Since 1900, typhoon intensity in the Pacific has increased by 30%. Carbon emissions continue to rise. Researchers used weather data and climate models to study Gaemi's impact, conducting the first comprehensive analysis of its kind.

Maja Vahlberg of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre notes progress in flood protection but emphasizes the need for stronger action, particularly for those living in vulnerable areas. She states that the future depends on our decisions now.

David Rush, 39, from Boise, Idaho, holds 181 Guinness World Records. His drive stems from a childhood where he often trailed his older brothers in sports. A pivotal win in a swimming race sparked his competitive spirit.

Rush, an MIT graduate, left the tech industry for motivational speaking. He aimed to highlight STEM education by breaking records. His first, in 2015, was juggling blindfolded for six-and-a-half minutes. He's since extended this to over an hour.

His records vary widely, from catching marshmallows to balancing toilet paper rolls. Each feat is verified by Guinness representatives or through videos and witnesses.

In January, Rush broke 55 vinyl records in 30 seconds, securing his 181st title. He surpasses Italy's Silvio Sabba, who held 180. Rush acknowledges the fluid nature of his records but remains committed to his goal.

He views these challenges not as trivial pursuits but as meaningful endeavors. His message: with determination and passion, one can achieve anything.

NFL owners have approved private equity firms to acquire up to 10% of teams. This decision, backed by 31 out of 32 owners, permits these funds to invest in up to six teams each. Cincinnati Bengals owner Mike Brown was the sole dissenter.

The approved firms include Ares Management, Sixth Street Partners, and Arctos Partners, among others. These firms, managing assets totaling $2 trillion, plan to invest $12 billion. This capital infusion is intended to aid team growth and improve fan experiences.

The minimum investment period is set at six years. This move addresses liquidity concerns within ownership groups and introduces a new capital source without disrupting team operations.

Subject to final approval, Arctos may invest across major North American sports leagues. The NFL, being the last major league to permit private equity, restricts investment to 10%, in contrast to other leagues that allow up to 30%.

This initiative could also finance new stadiums and renovations, benefiting teams such as the Buffalo Bills and Tennessee Titans.

Overall, the NFL's acceptance of private equity signifies a strategic change, aiming to strengthen team finances and infrastructure while preserving operational independence.
