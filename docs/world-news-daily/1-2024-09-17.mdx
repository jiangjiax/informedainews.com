The U.S. government has demanded that TikTok sell its operations within 90 days or face a ban. TikTok has filed a lawsuit, arguing that the move is unconstitutional. Today, the appeals court will hear arguments from both sides. The U.S. government is concerned about national security risks posed by TikTok's Chinese background, but TikTok denies any connection to the Chinese government. Efforts to reach a security agreement between the parties have previously broken down. The court's ruling remains pending.

Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, faces two federal gun charges: possession by a felon and obliterated serial number. Combined, they carry a 20-year max and $500,000 fine.

Routh appeared in Florida court, shackled and nonchalant. His bond hearing is set for Sept. 23.

Secret Service agents fired shots near Trump's golf course after spotting a rifle in the tree line. Routh fled in a Nissan SUV. Agents found a loaded SKS-style rifle with an unreadable serial number.

Routh has prior felony convictions: a 2002 machine gun possession and 2010 stolen goods.

Trump was unharmed. Attorney General Merrick Garland pledged a thorough FBI investigation.

Vice President Kamala Harris condemned the violence. President Joe Biden suggested the Secret Service needs more support.

### Canada's Inquiry into Foreign Election Interference Enters Second Phase

The public inquiry into foreign interference in Canada's elections has entered its second phase. Headed by Justice Marie-Josée Hogue, the inquiry will focus on the federal government's current ability to protect elections from foreign meddling. Over five weeks, more than 70 witnesses, including MPs, cabinet ministers, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, will testify.

The inquiry was sparked by media reports accusing China of interfering in the 2019 and 2021 elections. Hogue's initial report found no overall impact on election results despite possible interference in a few ridings.

This phase will examine government departments, agencies, and processes to combat foreign interference. Hogue has met with diaspora communities to gather insights on better protection measures.

The inquiry has access to intelligence reports from the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP), which alleged some parliamentarians helped foreign governments. Hogue cautioned against naming these MPs due to classified information.

Despite a more charged political climate, Hogue assures the inquiry will remain independent and impartial.

  alt="Superbugs Predicted to Cause Millions of Deaths by 2050 Due to Rising Drug Resistance"
/>

Superbugs will kill 39 million by 2050, mostly older folks. Infections once beaten by drugs now thrive.

AMR—bacteria outsmarting antibiotics—drives this. Deaths from AMR jumped from 1.14 million in 2021 to a projected 1.91 million by 2050.

Kids under 5 see fewer AMR deaths, thanks to vaccines and hygiene. But older folks? Their numbers rise. Over 70s face an 80% increase since 1990, expected to hit 146% by 2050.

Why? Age makes us vulnerable. Older bodies, more hospital visits, more infections. IV lines, chronic diseases—all fertile ground for resistant bugs.

Global leaders meet in New York to tackle this. Aim: cut AMR deaths by 10% by 2030.

The Lancet study, by the Global Research on Antimicrobial Resistance (Gram) Project, forecasts grim numbers, especially in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

Prevention and better healthcare could save millions. But time’s running out. The fight against superbugs is on.

  alt="Global Lake Warming Threatens Biodiversity and Ecosystems"
/>

Global lakes are facing unprecedented warming threats, primarily driven by human-induced climate change. By the end of this century, tropical lakes will experience this extreme warming first, affecting both surface and bottom layers, posing a serious threat to biodiversity and ecosystems.

Lakes are renowned for their rich biodiversity and vital ecological functions, but rapid temperature increases are altering this. A recent study published in *Nature Geoscience* warns that if climate warming continues, widespread warming in both surface and bottom layers of global lakes will far exceed previous observations.

The study used advanced climate computer models, the Community Earth System Model, Version 2, to simulate lake temperatures over a span from 1850 to 2100. The model was run 100 times on South Korea's fastest computer to distinguish natural variability from human interference. The results show that by the end of this century, global lakes will face unprecedented climatic conditions, with tropical lakes experiencing this first.

The warming signal rapidly propagates downward, with subsurface layers of tropical lakes also experiencing unprecedented conditions. High-latitude lakes delay or prevent the appearance of unprecedented deep-layer climates through stratification.

The consequences of unprecedented lake climates are profound, potentially leading to severe future ecosystem disruptions. Given the limited migratory abilities of lake organisms, understanding the timing of the emergence of unprecedented conditions is crucial for the adaptation, planning, and climate mitigation of lake ecosystems.

Meta, owner of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads, has banned Russian state media outlets RT, Rossiya Segodnya, and related entities globally. The ban stems from allegations of foreign interference and deceptive tactics in influence operations. Enforcement will roll out in the coming days.

The US has also taken action, filing money-laundering charges against two RT employees for allegedly hiring a US company to produce content aimed at influencing the 2024 election. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced new sanctions against RT, describing it as a "de facto arm of Russia’s intelligence apparatus."

Blinken accused RT of funding weapons and equipment for Russian soldiers in Ukraine, including sniper rifles and drones, some sourced from China. He detailed RT's targeting of countries in Europe, Africa, and the Americas, particularly Moldova, where Russia aims to incite protests if the election doesn't favor a Russia-preferred candidate.

**Key Terms:**
- **RT:** Formerly Russia Today, a Russian state-funded news network.
- **Rossiya Segodnya:** A Russian state-owned international news agency.
- **Hybrid war:** A military strategy that blends conventional warfare, cyberwarfare, and psychological operations.

**Insights:**
The ban and sanctions reflect a growing global concern over state-sponsored disinformation and its impact on democratic processes. Meta's move underscores the tech industry's role in combating foreign interference, while the US actions highlight the broader geopolitical implications of media manipulation.

  alt="UN Report: $10 Trillion Annual Loss from Neglecting Gender Equality"
/>

Governments worldwide are missing out on $10 trillion annually by neglecting to invest in women and gender equality, according to a UN report. The Gender Snapshot highlights that inadequate education for young women costs the global economy $10 trillion yearly. Low- and middle-income countries could lose $500 billion over five years if they don’t close the internet gender gap. Supporting female farmers could boost global GDP by $1 trillion.

At current rates, child marriage could persist until 2092. The report also notes that 47.8 million more women face food insecurity than men. It could take 137 more years to end extreme poverty for women. Climate change could push 158 million more women and girls into poverty than men.

Papa Seck, UN Women’s research head, emphasizes the high cost of inaction and the potential gains from gender equality. No country has all necessary laws to prevent discrimination, gender-based violence, and ensure equal rights. Over half of 120 countries restrict women from certain jobs and don’t classify rape based on consent.

In the UK, Rachel Saunders suggests new laws mandating salary transparency and sex offender alerts. Despite existing laws like the Equality Act 2010, gender pay gaps persist, and parental leave expectations remain skewed.

Jemima Olchawski of the Fawcett Society warns against complacency, noting ongoing inequalities and the Taliban’s harsh restrictions on Afghan women. Ezel Buse Sönmezocak advocates for funding feminist movements to prevent backsliding. The report serves as a call to action, urging bolder steps toward the UN’s sustainable development goals.

  alt="BRICS Nations Explore Alternatives to US Dollar Amid Sanctions"
/>

The discussion on the future of BRICS currency, the US dollar, and sanctions revealed a shift in global economic dynamics. Experts agree that BRICS nations are exploring alternatives to the dollar, driven by the need to counter sanctions and reduce dependency on Western financial systems.

Marcos Caramuru, former World Bank Executive, suggested a BRICS reserve asset akin to the SDR (Special Drawing Rights) to facilitate trade. This idea, though complex, could be tested experimentally.

Sergey Afontsev, from the Russian Academy of Sciences, highlighted Russia's economic resilience under sanctions. He noted that Russia's economic growth exceeded the global average last year, countering the intended effects of sanctions.

Ekaterina Arapova emphasized the importance of integrating national payment systems among BRICS members to adapt to sanctions risks. She also mentioned the strategic move of opening Russian bank branches in friendly jurisdictions, like VTB Bank in Shanghai.

Abdul Aziz Shabani and Mostafa Ahmed both pointed out that BRICS is challenging Western dominance. Shabani noted Saudi Arabia's interest in joining BRICS, signaling a shift in geopolitical power. Ahmed suggested that bilateral trade agreements could lead to a new BRICS currency.

Xu Wenhong criticized the SWIFT payment system, calling it a tool of political and economic pressure. He argued that Western financial systems no longer serve the interests of most countries.

In essence, the conversation underscores a growing desire among BRICS nations to create a more balanced and independent global financial system, free from Western control and sanctions.

### Singapore Pioneers Transition Credits to Accelerate ASEAN Decarbonization

Singapore is spearheading a new financial tool called transition credits. These credits are tied to the early closure of coal-fired power plants in Southeast Asia. The goal? Speeding up decarbonization while boosting Singapore’s capital market.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is at the helm, collaborating with companies and financial institutions to set up the system. One key project involves ACEN, a Philippine power company, which plans to shut down a coal plant in Batangas by 2030, a decade ahead of schedule. Transition credits will be issued based on the carbon emissions saved. These credits can then be sold, with proceeds used to offset early closure costs.

Asia’s reliance on coal is stark—60% of its electricity comes from coal-fired plants, many of which are less than 15 years old. Waiting for these plants to reach the end of their natural life won’t cut it. Early decommissioning, however, means unrecovered investments. Enter transition credits.

MAS has been reaching out to banks and international organizations to develop this system. DBS Group Holdings, Singapore’s largest lender, is already on board, working with Indonesia to phase out coal plants.

Sharad Somani from KPMG notes that climate targets require mobilizing capital from various sources. Transition credits, combined with low-interest loans, government subsidies, and private investments, could make early coal plant closures more viable.

In essence, transition credits are a financial bridge, helping to close the gap between fossil fuel reliance and clean energy transition.

### Chinese Investment Shifts to Emerging Markets and Greenfield Projects

Chinese outbound investment has shifted from advanced economies like the U.S. and Europe to emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. This shift is driven by tighter capital controls in China, anti-corruption campaigns, and the property market slump. The U.S. and Europe have also intensified scrutiny of Chinese investments due to national security concerns.

**Key Points:**
- **Investment Rebound:** Outbound Chinese FDI rebounded to $103 billion in 2023 but remains below pre-pandemic levels.
- **Regional Shift:** Asia is now the largest recipient of Chinese FDI, with 72% of investments going to non-advanced economies.
- **Greenfield Projects:** Chinese investors are increasingly focusing on greenfield projects, which involve building facilities from scratch, rather than mergers and acquisitions.
- **Economic Influence:** This shift allows China to exert more economic influence in emerging markets, creating local jobs and boosting local economies.

**Insight:**
The shift to greenfield projects signifies a strategic move by Chinese companies to diversify supply chains and navigate geopolitical tensions. This approach not only mitigates risks but also deepens China's economic footprint in regions eager for development. Governments aiming to counter China's influence now face the dual challenge of competing with both state-backed financing and mature Chinese multinationals offering local economic benefits.

### Google Funds Satellite Constellation for Wildfire Detection

Google's philanthropic arm has pledged $13 million to fund FireSat, a satellite constellation designed to detect wildfires. Managed by Earth Fire Alliance (EFA), FireSat will deploy over 50 small satellites in low-Earth orbit. These satellites, built by Muon Space, will use six-band multispectral infrared instruments to scan vast areas, identifying wildfires as small as 16 by 16 feet.

Google's AI will analyze satellite data, comparing current images with previous ones to confirm fire presence. The system also considers local weather and infrastructure. Initial testing involved flying sensors over controlled burns to validate the detection model.

FireSat's partners include the Environmental Defense Fund, the Moore Foundation, and the Minderoo Foundation. The constellation aims to provide rapid fire detection, with initial satellites observing every point on Earth twice daily. At full capacity, FireSat will reduce global revisit times to 20 minutes, with wildfire-prone regions monitored every nine minutes.

This initiative marks a significant step in fire management and climate action, emphasizing the need for collaboration in addressing increasingly intense and rapid wildfires.

### Armenian Startup EasyDMARC Raises $20M Amid Email Security Standards Shift

EasyDMARC, an Armenian startup, just raised $20 million in a Series A round led by Radian Capital. The company simplifies email security using DMARC, a standard that prevents spam, spoofing, and phishing. Until recently, DMARC was overlooked, but Google and Yahoo's mandate for bulk email senders in 2023 changed that.

DMARC, or Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance, ensures emails are authentic. Despite its 2012 creation, many companies hadn't adopted it. EasyDMARC seized the opportunity, gaining over 83,000 customers in 130 countries since its 2018 launch.

Founder Gerasim Hovhannisyan noted the funding surge post-Google's announcement. Over 40 VCs showed interest, but Radian aligned best with EasyDMARC's culture and goals. The startup aims to expand in the U.S. and globally.

Competitors like Valimail, ProofPoint, and Minecast exist, but EasyDMARC's edge is simplicity. Hovhannisyan emphasizes ease of use, crucial for widespread adoption.

The startup's inception traces back to 2016, sparked by a phishing attack on a multi-billion-dollar company. Hovhannisyan found existing solutions complex, prompting him and co-founder Avag Arakelyan to create EasyDMARC.

Future standards, like PCI DSS for fintech companies, will further boost EasyDMARC. This funding highlights Armenia's growing startup ecosystem, known for tech innovation and attracting global investors.

Microsoft's Office suite is undergoing a revolutionary upgrade, with AI reshaping the workflows of a billion people.

Satya Nadella announced the beginning of a new AI-driven workflow era. Python code can now be directly embedded into Excel, with AI instantly processing data. With just a single prompt, ideas can be transformed into PPTs.

Three key highlights:
1. Copilot Pages: Integrates web search, content curation, and team collaboration into one platform.
2. Office suite upgrade: AI generates Python code to process Excel data in seconds; a single prompt instantly transforms ideas into PPTs.
3. Copilot Agent: An AI assistant that automates business processes.

Copilot is powered by the most advanced o1 model, offering higher reasoning performance and faster responses. The Pages system is free and open, breaking down silos between office tools, communication, and business processes.

Python and Excel are seamlessly integrated, simplifying data processing. Copilot's advanced analytics features automatically generate code and build predictive models.

PPT creation requires only a prompt, with Copilot automatically handling design and content. Word and Outlook have also been improved, enhancing writing and email management efficiency.

Inspired by GPTs, Copilot Agents support the integration of terabyte-scale documents, allowing users to customize their creation. Sixty percent of Fortune 500 companies are already using Copilot, with user numbers growing nearly double month-over-month.

Microsoft's move will significantly boost productivity but also raises concerns about "efficiency" leading to "cost reduction." In the AI era, a new workflow is beginning, and the future of work will be fundamentally transformed.

Ye, formerly Kanye West, performed in Haikou, China, after rare approval from the country’s censors. His show, announced days before, sold out 42,000 tickets in minutes. This marked his first return to China in 16 years, a period during which the government’s tolerance for Western musicians has waned, and Ye’s controversies have multiplied.

China’s Communist party rigorously censors foreign content, often requiring artists to submit set lists and lyrics for approval. Few Western acts, including Billie Eilish, Coldplay, and Taylor Swift, have toured China in recent years. Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga were barred due to their reputations and political associations.

Ye’s approval raised eyebrows, given his history of antisemitic comments, endorsement of Donald Trump, and sexist lyrics. Haikou authorities reportedly received complaints, and a Swift fan group letter argued Ye’s content was unfit for China. Despite this, Ye’s show announcement garnered over 160 million interactions on Weibo, with many questioning the approval.

China’s economic struggles, including a property crisis and youth unemployment, contrast with rising demand for live entertainment. Ye’s concert attracted mostly out-of-province attendees, highlighting Hainan’s reliance on tourism and entertainment. Shanghai government advisers have expressed a desire to attract high-profile artists like Swift, whose tours generate significant consumer spending.

Ye’s original Taiwan show was canceled due to “unforeseen circumstances,” possibly related to China’s stance on Taiwan’s sovereignty. The decision to allow Ye’s performance in China remains a curious exception in the country’s strict cultural policies.

Donald Trump lost a legal battle with Eddy Grant over using "Electric Avenue" in a 2020 campaign ad without permission. The 40-second clip, featuring Joe Biden in a railroad cart and a Trump-Pence train, was viewed over 13.7 million times before removal. Grant's lawyers sent a cease and desist letter, but the video stayed up until Grant sued on September 1.

In a Manhattan court, Judge John G Koeltl ruled Trump breached Grant's copyright, liable for damages and legal fees. Trump's lawyers argued fair use, but Koeltl rejected it. Brett Van Benthysen, one of Grant's lawyers, said, "It’s everything we asked for, 100%."

Brian Caplan, another lawyer, emphasized Grant's belief in artist rights and control over creative output. The court's decision, he said, helps others fight unauthorized use of sound recordings and musical compositions. Politicians, Caplan noted, are not above the law.

Grant's original lawsuit sought $300,000, but damages are yet to be determined. The case's success may encourage others, like the White Stripes and Isaac Hayes' estate, currently suing Trump for similar issues. Beyoncé also reportedly objected to Trump using her song "Freedom."

This ruling underscores the importance of respecting artists' rights, even for high-profile politicians. It sends a clear message: unauthorized use of creative works will be met with legal consequences.

AMR refers to the ability of bacteria, viruses, and parasites to resist drugs, rendering treatments ineffective. This resistance threatens public health, as common infections could become untreatable.

The urgency is clear: without action, AMR could cause 10 million deaths annually by 2050. The UN aims to foster international cooperation, ensuring equitable access to effective antibiotics and promoting responsible use.

My take: This isn't just a medical issue; it's a global crisis. Leaders must act decisively, balancing innovation with ethical distribution. The clock is ticking.

FDA approves Apple Watch's sleep apnea detection.

The feature uses the watch's accelerometer to track subtle wrist movements linked to disrupted breathing patterns. Frequent disruptions over multiple nights may indicate sleep apnea. Users can view their data in the iPhone Health app, categorized as "elevated" or "not elevated."

Available on Apple Watch Series 10, 9, and Ultra, the tool aims to detect moderate to severe sleep apnea in adults not yet diagnosed.

Seven candidates, including Japan's Watanabe Morinari, will compete for the presidency of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in March 2024. Watanabe, 65, is the first Japanese candidate for the role. He currently heads the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) and has been an IOC member since 2018. The election will be held in Greece, marking the end of Thomas Bach's 12-year term. Other contenders include Prince Feisal Al Hussein, Sebastian Coe, Kirsty Coventry, Johan Eliasch, David Lappartient, and Juan Antonio Samaranch. Notably, eight of the nine past IOC presidents were European, with one from the U.S.

Scientists have discovered a fascinating link between the gut and the brain: swallowing nutritious food triggers the release of serotonin, a "feel-good" chemical. This finding could pave the way for new treatments for eating disorders.

Researchers from the University of Bonn and the University of Cambridge focused on how the esophagus and brain communicate during eating. They used fruit fly larvae, with their simpler neural networks, to map the connections between the gut and brain.

The team found "stretch receptors" in the larvae's esophagus linked to six serotonin-producing neurons in the brain. These neurons only release serotonin in response to high-quality food, ensuring the larvae continue to eat.

This mechanism, crucial for survival, suggests humans likely have a similar system. If confirmed, it could offer insights into treating disorders like anorexia or bulimia. However, more research is needed.

Serotonin, a neurotransmitter, regulates mood and induces a sense of well-being. "Stretch receptors" are sensory cells that detect mechanical changes, like the stretching of tissues.

Huzhang, a decorative plant originating from Japan, was introduced to the United States in the late 19th century and became popular due to its vigorous growth. However, its invasive root system quickly spread, penetrating the ground and building foundations, becoming a challenging invasive species to eradicate. In 42 U.S. states, huzhang disrupts ecosystems, leading to a decline in property values, such as a 10% drop in home prices in certain communities in New York State.

In the UK, huzhang poses similarly severe problems, causing annual property value losses of up to £2 billion and removal costs of approximately £166 million. Its roots penetrate several meters underground and spread laterally up to 7 meters, and even if the plant is cut down, the roots can regenerate.

In East Asia, particularly in China, huzhang does not cause similar destruction. The local ecosystem coexists with huzhang, and herbivores and microorganisms control its spread. In China, huzhang is even regarded as a medicinal plant and a delicious food ingredient. Its tender stems are rich in fiber and vitamin C and can be served cold, pickled, or stir-fried.
