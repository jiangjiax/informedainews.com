LONDON — Labour's significant victory in the U.K. election positions Keir Starmer to become the next prime minister. Exit polls indicate Labour securing a substantial majority, ending the Conservatives' 14-year reign. In his victory speech, Starmer declared, "People are ready for change."

Rishi Sunak, the incumbent PM, retained his seat but experienced a drop in his vote share by over 15%. Defence Secretary Grant Shapps was defeated by Labour. Nigel Farage, representing Reform UK, secured his first parliamentary seat, emphasizing immigration as a pivotal issue.

Labour's Rachel Reeves maintained her seat, potentially becoming the first female chancellor. Reform UK, known for its stringent immigration policies, might gain 13 seats, a notable increase from their zero seats in 2019.

This election signifies a transformative shift in U.K. politics, with Labour set to enact significant reforms after years in opposition.

/>

In June, the "2024 Nature Index Research Leaders" list was released. This index tracks contributions to high-quality scientific and health publications.

Topping the list is the Chinese Academy of Sciences, followed by Harvard University and the Max Planck Society. Notably, seven of the top ten institutions are Chinese.

The Chinese Academy of Sciences leads with a share of 2243.22, followed by University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, and Peking University.

This dominance by Chinese institutions marks a significant shift from previous years, where fewer Chinese institutions made the top ten.

The index also highlights a decline in rankings for prestigious institutions like Stanford University and MIT, suggesting a shift in global research leadership.

Nature Index operates on a zero-sum basis, meaning gains by some institutions come at the expense of others. This dynamic underscores the competitive nature of scientific research.

The rise of Chinese institutions and the decline of some Western ones reflect broader trends in global research funding and focus. The future will reveal if this trend continues and what it means for global scientific collaboration.

### Hamas Proposes Cease-Fire Amendments, Mediators Respond Positively

Hamas' proposed amendments to a cease-fire have received positive responses from mediators, while Israel's stance remains ambiguous. Negotiations had stalled but are now revived, with U.S., Qatari, and Egyptian mediators involved. Hamas demands the withdrawal of Israeli troops and an end to the war, whereas Israel aims to eliminate Hamas before halting the conflict.

The Gaza war, lasting nine months, has caused extensive devastation. 2.3 million people have been displaced, often multiple times. Humanitarian aid is restricted, leading to widespread hunger and fears of famine. A U.N. court has identified a "plausible risk of genocide," a claim denied by Israel.

The war was sparked by Hamas' attack on October 7th, with Israeli offensives resulting in over 38,000 deaths in Gaza, according to the Health Ministry, which counts all casualties without distinguishing between combatants and civilians.

Recent events include:
- Seven Palestinians killed in the West Bank.
- Israel is considering Hamas' cease-fire response.
- Iran's presidential runoff sees low turnout.
- Fires mark the conflict on the Lebanon-Israel border.
- Pro-Palestinian protesters breach Australia's Parliament House.

Hamas' amendments focus on a full cease-fire, Israeli withdrawal, and the release of hostages. Israel's response is pending, and negotiation dates are unscheduled. Hamas insists on no foreign forces in Gaza and a purely Palestinian administration.

The U.S. suggests regional countries contribute to post-war scenarios in Gaza. Hamas meets with Hezbollah to discuss ongoing negotiations and regional security.

### Massive Password Leak Exposes Nearly 10 Billion Credentials

On July 4, a hacker posted a file containing nearly 10 billion passwords on a forum. This list, known as RockYou2024, is the largest ever leaked, surpassing RockYou2021, which held 8.4 billion passwords.

Hackers utilize these lists for brute force attacks, attempting numerous password combinations rapidly. With RockYou2024, they now have an extensive collection of real-world passwords to test.

This leak heightens the risk of credential stuffing attacks, which exploit stolen account details to gain access to other services.

Users are advised to update their passwords and employ multi-factor authentication, thereby adding an additional layer of security.

The hacker, identified as ObamaCare, updated the older list with fresh data from recent leaks, incorporating an additional 1.5 billion passwords.

Currently, it is uncertain whether any private data has been compromised directly due to this list. However, it is prudent to assume that your password might be included.

  alt="Hackers Threaten to Leak Taylor Swift Ticket Data"

Hackers, calling themselves ShinyHunters, claim they've got barcode data for Taylor Swift's Eras tour tickets. They want millions from Ticketmaster or they'll leak it.

Ticketmaster says no deal. They claim their tech updates barcodes too fast for the hackers' data to work. Cybersecurity experts agree, saying the stolen data is useless for making fake tickets.

ShinyHunters have a history of big hacks, hitting companies like Santander, AT&T, and Microsoft. They've hit Ticketmaster before, grabbing data on 560 million customers earlier this year.

Ticketmaster's parent company, Live Nation, is already in hot water. The US Department of Justice is suing them for monopolizing ticket sales. They've also botched Swift's tour sales, leading to long waits and high resale prices.

Swift's tour has been a target before. Hackers hit Australian ticket seller Ticketek, stealing accounts and reselling tickets.

Cyberattacks and ransom demands are on the rise. In 2023, victims paid over $1.1 billion in ransoms. The UK's National Health Service is still recovering from a major attack.

ShinyHunters tried selling stolen bank and credit card info from Santander. The FBI and DOJ shut down their forum, but they just moved to another site.

  alt="The China Securities Regulatory Commission intensifies its efforts to combat financial fraud in the capital market."
/>

The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), in collaboration with multiple departments, has issued the "Opinions on Further Enhancing the Comprehensive Punishment and Prevention of Financial Fraud in the Capital Market," aimed at combating financial fraud and protecting the rights and interests of investors.

Key points include:
- Focusing on cracking down on fraudulent issuances and false information disclosures.
- Accelerating regulatory transformation and improving investigation and penalty mechanisms.
- Promoting amendments to the Securities Law, increasing the maximum fines to 10 million yuan and 5 million yuan.
- Enhancing the maximum prison term for illegal disclosure in the Criminal Law to 10 years.
- Intermediate institutions and their practitioners who issue false certification documents can be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison.

The CSRC emphasizes that financial fraud undermines market integrity and harms investor interests. In recent years, it has handled multiple fraud cases, promoted the establishment of a collective litigation system, and implemented mandatory delisting for major violations.

Addressing the covert and complex nature of financial fraud, the CSRC will strengthen regulatory coordination, building a comprehensive long-term mechanism for punishment and prevention. This includes optimizing the law enforcement system, increasing accountability, enhancing inter-departmental and central-local coordination, and implementing regular prevention measures against financial fraud.

Personal view:
This move demonstrates China's emphasis on the integrity of the capital market, reinforcing the crackdown on financial fraud through legal and regulatory means. It not only helps to purify the market environment but also sends a clear signal to investors about the protection of their rights.

### Engineering mRNA for Personalized Medicine

Engineered mRNA transforms cells into tiny bio-factories, producing drugs that treat inflammatory skin diseases and cancers. This technology paves the way for personalized medicine, where the body makes its own drugs.

mRNA, familiar from COVID-19 vaccines, directs cells to make specific proteins. Researchers at the University of Texas used engineered mRNA to prompt cells to secrete therapeutic proteins, successfully treating psoriasis and cancer in mice.

Daniel Siegwart, a professor at UT Southwestern, envisions a future where patients receive monthly treatments at home, improving their quality of life.

The study introduced a novel approach: using engineered signal peptides (SPs) to guide proteins out of cells for systemic therapeutic effects. SPs act as metaphorical transport labels, directing proteins to their destinations within or outside the cell.

Researchers modified mRNA to include a secretion-oriented SP, then attached it to mRNA sequences encoding various proteins, including therapeutic ones like etanercept and anti-PD-L1.

When delivered via lipid nanoparticles, these modified mRNAs caused cells to secrete the encoded proteins into the extracellular fluid. In mice, this treatment reduced psoriatic skin patches and slowed tumor growth, doubling survival rates.

This technique, dubbed Signal Peptide-Engineered Nucleic Acid Design (SEND), could enhance the efficacy of protein drugs currently delivered by infusion, reducing side effects. It promises to improve health and quality of life for patients with inflammatory diseases, cancers, blood clotting disorders, diabetes, and genetic conditions.

The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).

### Friendship Benches: A Simple Solution to Mental Health Care

In Zimbabwe, mental health care is scarce. Tambudzai Tembo, after her son's arrest, faced despair. Traditional therapy was out of reach. A wooden bench and a grandmother's ear saved her.

This therapy, known as the Friendship Bench, employs trained grandmothers to listen and counsel. It draws from Zimbabwe's traditional respect for elders' wisdom. Dixon Chibanda, a psychiatrist, pioneered this approach, training grandmothers in basic problem-solving therapy.

The method has since spread to the U.S., Vietnam, Botswana, Malawi, Kenya, Tanzania, and London. In New York, orange benches provide support in Harlem, Brooklyn, and the Bronx. Washington has its own initiative, DC Grandparents for Mental Health.

The benches create a trusted space where people can open up to grandmothers, breaking the stigma. Barbara Allen, an 81-year-old grandmother, advocates for this cause, believing that age brings innate wisdom.

The Friendship Bench meets a critical need by offering a simple, effective solution. Grandmothers, with their empathy and local connections, are pivotal. They make mental health care accessible and personal.

### North Dakota Tribe Builds Massive Greenhouse for Food Sovereignty

A North Dakota tribe, the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation, is constructing a massive greenhouse. This project, dubbed Native Green Grow, seeks to reestablish their ancestral farming heritage. The tribe's land was inundated in the 1950s by the Garrison Dam, resulting in the creation of Lake Sakakawea. This new greenhouse, upon completion, will rank among the largest in the world, spanning 14.5 acres.

The initial phase, with a budget of $76 million, encompasses a 3.3-acre greenhouse, a warehouse, and additional facilities. This infrastructure will enable the tribe to cultivate a diverse range of crops, from lettuce to strawberries. The tribe intends to supply food to their reservation and beyond, including to food banks in remote regions.

This endeavor aligns with a broader movement among tribes to achieve food sovereignty. The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the necessity for self-reliant food systems. The USDA supports this through its Indigenous Food Sovereignty Initiative, which advocates for indigenous farming practices and food independence.

The tribe's project is viable due to access to potable water and natural gas from the Bakken oil field. They plan to utilize this gas for heating and fertilization, mitigating environmental concerns related to flaring.

In summary, the greenhouse signifies a substantial stride toward self-sufficiency and cultural rejuvenation for the tribe.
