The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress has decided to gradually delay the statutory retirement age starting from 2025. Male employees will have their retirement age extended from 60 to 63, while female employees will see their retirement age increased from 50 or 55 to 55 or 58, respectively, with the process completed over 15 years.

The delay in retirement follows the principles of small-step adjustments, flexible implementation, classified advancement, and overall consideration. The government encourages employment and entrepreneurship, safeguards the rights of workers, and coordinates work on elderly care and childcare.

Starting from 2030, the minimum contribution period for basic pensions will be increased from 15 to 20 years. Employees can choose flexible early retirement, up to three years in advance, or flexible delayed retirement, up to three years later.

The state has established a pension incentive mechanism to encourage longer contributions, higher contributions, and later retirement for greater benefits. An employment-first strategy is implemented to promote high-quality and full employment, and to improve the public employment service system.

Employers hiring workers beyond the statutory retirement age must ensure their basic rights. The state strengthens the protection of rights for flexible workers and new forms of employment, and improves the paid annual leave system.

Workers in special occupations and high-altitude regions who meet the criteria can apply for early retirement. The state establishes a coordinated home-community-institutional elderly care service system, integrating medical care with elderly care and rehabilitation, and vigorously developing a universal childcare service system.

**Notes**:
- **Statutory Retirement Age**: The legal age at which a worker is eligible to retire.
- **Basic Pension**: The pension provided by the state to ensure the basic living standards of retirees.
- **Flexible Retirement**: Workers can choose to retire earlier or later based on their individual circumstances.

Three candidates vying to lead the Commonwealth—from Gambia, Ghana, and Lesotho—have urged reparations for slavery and colonialism. At a Chatham House debate, they advocated for either financial reparations or "reparative justice."

Calls for reparations surged after George Floyd's murder in 2020, igniting global Black Lives Matter protests. African and Caribbean nations have since formed an alliance to pressure former slave-owning states.

Ghana’s Shirley Botchwey suggested the Commonwealth's role would depend on member governments. Lesotho’s Joshua Setipa supported "reparative justice," highlighting the Commonwealth's history in addressing racism. Gambia’s Mamadou Tangara backed reparatory justice, proposing the Commonwealth's convening power to facilitate dialogue.

The Commonwealth, born from the British Empire, comprises 56 nations, mostly former colonies. Despite being seen as a colonial relic, candidates argued it could address modern issues like climate change and youth unemployment.

The leadership vote will occur at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Samoa in October.

**Insights:**
The debate underscores a shift in global consciousness regarding historical injustices. The Commonwealth, often viewed through a colonial lens, now faces a pivotal moment. Its potential role in reparative justice could redefine its relevance and impact.

### UK Designates Data Centers as Critical Infrastructure to Enhance Cybersecurity

The U.K. has designated data centers as Critical National Infrastructure (CNI), a status previously reserved for sectors like energy and defense. This move aims to strengthen cybersecurity and improve coordination between data center operators and the government. Peter Kyle, the British Technology Minister, highlighted the crucial role data centers play in the digital economy and personal data protection.

This CNI designation enables data center operators to communicate directly with the government, enhancing readiness against cyber threats. It marks the first time a new sector has received CNI status in nearly a decade.

Simultaneously, the U.K. approved a £3.75 billion ($4.9 billion) project by DC01UK to construct Europe's largest data center in Hertfordshire. This initiative is expected to create over 700 local jobs and support 13,740 data and tech positions. Amazon's AWS division also announced an £8 billion ($10.45 billion) investment in U.K. data centers over the next five years.

Data centers are essential to cloud computing, enabling the delivery of internet services via remote servers. Their outages can cause widespread disruptions, as seen in a recent global IT outage triggered by a faulty software update from CrowdStrike.

The U.K. plans further cybersecurity enhancements, including a new Cyber Security and Resilience Bill to protect essential IT infrastructure supply chains.

In September 2023, a landslide in Greenland triggered a mega-tsunami, causing the entire Earth to vibrate for nine days. The collapse of a 1,200-metre mountain peak into Dickson Fjord was due to a melting glacier, a result of global heating. The initial wave reached 200 metres, with seismic waves resonating through the planet for over a week.

This event was unprecedented, initially baffling researchers. It took 68 scientists from 40 institutions in 15 countries to identify the cause. The landslide sent 25 million cubic metres of rock and ice into the fjord, generating waves that reduced to seven metres within minutes but continued to send seismic waves globally.

The tsunami destroyed an ancient Inuit site and damaged a research station on Ella Island, 70km away. A nearby cruise ship narrowly avoided disaster. The event highlighted the rapid impacts of climate change, showing that even seemingly stable regions are vulnerable.

The study, published in *Science*, used high-resolution computer simulations to model the tsunami, matching the observed seismic data. This breakthrough in tsunami modelling opens new avenues for understanding and predicting such events.

As global temperatures rise, similar incidents are expected to become more common. This event underscores the far-reaching effects of climate change, demonstrating how it can impact the entire planet within hours.

  alt="Japan's Corporate Openness Tested by Seven & i vs. Couche-Tard Showdown"
/>

Alimentation Couche-Tard’s bold bid for Japan’s Seven & i Holdings has stirred a whirlwind in corporate Japan. This $38.5 billion all-cash offer, the largest foreign takeover attempt in Japanese history, is a test of Japan’s newfound openness to cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&A).

Seven & i, owner of the 7-Eleven chain, deemed the bid “grossly” undervalued and urged Couche-Tard to reconsider. The Japanese company’s rejection reflects a strategic stance rather than a defensive one. Tokyo’s decade-long push for better corporate governance and foreign investment has made Japan a magnet for global capital. Yet, accepting a lowball offer would undermine this progress.

The showdown is a litmus test. It will reveal whether Japan’s tolerance for foreign M&A is genuine or merely hype. Seven & i’s attempt to classify itself as a national security asset under the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act (FEFTA) was rebuffed, indicating a shift in regulatory attitudes.

Japan’s transformation from insular to investment-friendly has been remarkable. Reforms, including boosting returns on investment and diversifying boardrooms, have attracted heavyweights like Warren Buffett and Elliott Management. The stock market’s euphoric rally underscores this shift.

However, Japan’s investment renaissance is still a work in progress. The Seven & i-Couche-Tard clash highlights the need for continued reforms. The incoming prime minister must reinvigorate efforts to enhance Japanese competitiveness, cutting bureaucracy and loosening labor markets.

Seven & i should seize this moment to outline its growth strategy, viewing the bid as a wake-up call rather than a crisis. The outcome will be closely watched by global investors and regulators, especially in the U.S., where 7-Eleven has a significant presence.

In essence, this showdown is not just about a corporate takeover; it’s a pivotal moment for Japan’s economic evolution.

Genetic research has long been biased towards populations of European descent, overlooking the genetic diversity of other ethnic groups. This limitation has resulted in the undiscovered presence of many important gene variations, hindering medical progress and health equity.

Professor Hailiang Huang's team has proposed a new method—SuSiEx, which successfully integrates multi-ethnic genetic data, enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of analysis. This method not only improves the limitations of traditional analysis but also provides a crucial foundation for personalized medicine and drug development.

The innovation of SuSiEx lies in its cross-ethnic data integration, enabling a more comprehensive capture of key gene variations across different populations. Particularly in regions like Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the method significantly improves data utilization efficiency, helping scientists gain a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic characteristics in these areas.

This research did not happen overnight but is based on nearly a decade of accumulated work by the team. Professor Huang has been focusing on the genetic research of non-European populations since his postdoctoral days, dedicated to enhancing the fairness and inclusiveness of global genetic research.

In the future, Professor Huang's research group plans to further expand the application of this method, especially in mixed populations. They will also delve deeper into complex diseases such as mental disorders and inflammatory bowel disease, striving to provide new strategies for clinical treatment.

This research marks an important step in the integration of multi-ethnic genetic studies, contributing to global health initiatives.

## Video Game

### EU Consumer Group Calls for Ban on Manipulative In-Game Purchases

A consumer group in Europe, BEUC, has filed a complaint against popular video games like Fortnite and Minecraft, accusing them of "purposefully tricking consumers" into overspending on in-game purchases. The group claims these games, which generate over $50 billion annually, are particularly manipulative towards children, who spend an average of €39 per month on such purchases.

BEUC is calling for a ban on in-game paid currencies and recommends more transparency in pricing, stricter age restrictions, and clearer display of real-world costs. They argue that current practices exploit children's lack of financial literacy.

Video Games Europe, representing major game publishers, counters that in-game currencies are well-understood and that their members comply with European consumer laws. They emphasize that many games can be played without spending money.

The issue is significant, with over half of EU consumers regularly playing video games, and 84% of 11-14-year-olds engaging in gaming. BEUC's broader complaint could intensify scrutiny on the industry.

In-game currencies, or virtual money used to purchase items within games, are at the heart of the dispute. BEUC believes these currencies obscure real costs, leading to uninformed spending.

### Harvey Weinstein Faces New Charges in New York

Harvey Weinstein, the once-powerful Hollywood producer, faces new charges from a New York grand jury. The specifics are sealed. This follows his 2020 conviction for rape and criminal sex act, overturned in April due to procedural errors. Prosecutors plan to retry him on the same charges and possibly new ones.

Weinstein, 72, recently underwent heart surgery. Over 80 women have accused him of sexual assault or harassment; he denies all claims, insisting encounters were consensual. His retrial is set for November, though it's unclear if the new charges will be included.

In 2022, Weinstein was convicted in Los Angeles of rape and sexual assault, sentenced to 16 years. His team is appealing this verdict.

Weinstein and his brother, Bob, were influential in the 1990s and 2000s, producing films like "Pulp Fiction" and distributing Oscar winners. His downfall began in 2017 when women publicly accused him, sparking the #MeToo movement.

Recent research presented at the European Respiratory Society (ERS) conference in Vienna suggests that a simple saline nasal spray can significantly reduce the duration of common colds in children. The study, led by Dr. Sandeep Ramalingam of the University of Edinburgh, found that children treated with a 2.6% hypertonic saline solution experienced their symptoms for an average of six days, compared to eight days for those receiving standard care.

The study, known as ELVIS-Kids, involved 407 children under six years old. Half were given the saline nasal spray, while the other half received conventional care. The saline group not only recovered faster but also required fewer medications.

The researchers noted that the saline solution helps boost the production of hypochlorous acid in nasal cells, which can inhibit viral replication. This not only shortens the duration of the illness but also reduces its spread within families.

Dr. Steve Cunningham, also from the University of Edinburgh, emphasized the practical benefits: "Shortening the duration of a child's cold means fewer family members get sick, which can help families return to normal activities more quickly."

Alexander Möeller, a pediatrician from the University of Zurich, praised the study, highlighting its potential global impact: "This inexpensive and straightforward intervention could greatly alleviate the health and economic burdens of the most common childhood illness."

The researchers plan to investigate further how saline nasal sprays affect wheezing during colds, as initial results showed a significant reduction in wheezing among treated children.

### WADA Report Clears Chinese Swimmers Amid Doping Controversy

WADA's report absolved 23 Chinese swimmers of doping, despite Swiss prosecutor Eric Cottier's findings that Chinese officials broke rules. Cottier's report cleared WADA of bias but criticized China's antidoping agency for rule violations. The swimmers were quietly cleared in 2021, blamed on a contaminated kitchen, allowing them to compete in the Tokyo and Paris Olympics.

The report's release sparked controversy, with critics like Travis Tygart of the United States Anti-Doping Agency arguing WADA gave China special treatment. The report's findings were met with skepticism, and the underlying question of doping by Chinese athletes remains unresolved.

The WADA board meeting in Turkey was tense, with attempts to bar Dr. Rahul Gupta, a Biden administration official, from discussing the Chinese case. Gupta, representing over 40 countries, was eventually allowed to participate after WADA withdrew allegations against him.

The report's publication did not bring closure, as a U.S. criminal investigation continues, and Congress questions WADA's actions. The situation has strained relations between WADA and U.S. officials, raising broader concerns about the global antidoping system's efficacy.

### Tsleil-Waututh Nation's Pre-Colonial Diet Revealed: Rich and Varied

A new study with the Tsleil-Waututh Nation and UBC reveals their pre-colonial diet was rich and varied, centered on salmon, forage fish, shellfish, and marine birds. The Burrard Inlet, now between Vancouver and the North Shore, sustained them for millennia with abundant marine life. The Tsleil-Waututh's stewardship ensured sustainable harvests.

Lead author Meaghan Efford notes the diet was high in protein, averaging over 200 grams per person daily, far exceeding modern recommendations. Marine fowl provided essential fats, mitigating health issues common in high-protein diets.

Michelle George, a Tsleil-Waututh specialist, emphasizes the continuity of their oral histories, which the study validates. Efford's research supports their claims, challenging Western science's dominance.

Recent restoration projects aim to revive the inlet's health, fostering marine life recovery. These efforts reconnect the community with their ancestral diet and culture, vital for preserving heritage.

Shanghai, China's trendsetter, sees a rise in vegetarian and vegan dining. Once a city of meat-heavy meals, it now embraces plant-based cuisine. Celebrity chef Ken Hom notes a shift, driven by health and environmental concerns.

Vegetarianism in China is still niche, with only 4-5% of the population abstaining from meat, often for religious reasons. Yet, interest grows, especially among the educated youth. The China Vegan Society aims to cut meat consumption by 30% in a decade.

Shanghai leads this change. Vegetarian restaurants move beyond temple fare, offering diverse, often vegan, menus. Fu He Hui, a standout, requires reservations months in advance. Chef Tony Lu, a former meat lover, now explores rare plant ingredients, creating seasonal, minimalist dishes.

This shift reflects broader cultural changes, blending Eastern traditions with Western health trends. Shanghai's culinary evolution mirrors its rapid modernization, balancing old and new.
