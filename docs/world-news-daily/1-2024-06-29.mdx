Former Uvalde schools police chief Pete Arredondo and officer Adrian Gonzales have been indicted on multiple counts of felony child endangerment and abandonment for their slow response to the 2022 school massacre that killed 19 children and two teachers. The indictments, confirmed by the local district attorney, mark the first criminal charges against officers involved in one of the deadliest school shootings in US history. Both officers are expected to turn themselves in.

The incident, which saw an 18-year-old gunman hold a classroom hostage for over 70 minutes before being confronted by officers, has been heavily criticized. Reports by Texas lawmakers and the US Department of Justice highlighted failures by law enforcement to prioritize saving lives over their own safety, with hundreds of officers present but inactive during the shooting.

Uvalde remains divided, with some seeking closure and others demanding accountability. Robb Elementary School, the site of the tragedy, is now permanently closed, with a new school under construction.

In North Korea, a young man was executed for sharing K-pop and South Korean films. This harsh act, disclosed in a 2024 report, emphasizes Pyongyang's unyielding efforts to isolate its citizens from foreign culture. The regime, wary of ideological decay, imposes stringent laws against "reactionary" practices, including Western-influenced fashion and customs.

Despite these severe measures, South Korean culture continues to infiltrate, fueled by a youthful yearning for change. Defectors confirm the irresistible appeal of South Korean media, which raises questions about their own oppressive reality.

This cultural conflict exposes profound discontent, where private discussions among friends and family frequently criticize the regime. The regime's countermeasure—launching balloons filled with waste in response to cultural payloads from the South—merely underscores its desperation and the increasing influence of South Korean culture.

## Economy

### Morgan Stanley Predicts Fed and ECB Rate Cuts in September

Morgan Stanley's Andrew Sheets predicts that both the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank will cut rates in September. Recent data indicates a slowdown in inflation in both regions. The ECB has already reduced rates, whereas the Fed has postponed such action, citing persistent high inflation in the U.S. Sheets anticipates that inflation will continue to decline, supporting the case for rate cuts.

Inflation in the Eurozone increased marginally to 2.6% in May, influenced by shifts in the energy market and reduced government support. Meanwhile, U.S. inflation remained constant at 3.3% year-on-year. The Fed closely monitors the core PCE price index, which is its preferred measure of inflation.

Economists predict that the Fed will reduce rates from 5.25% to 5.50% in September, with the possibility of additional cuts later in the year. The ECB is also expected to cut rates in both September and December.

### AI Advancements in Drug Discovery for Neglected Diseases

In 2019, computer scientist Guo Jinjin, inspired by his aunt's medical work in Africa, shifted his focus to drug discovery. He joined the Global Health Drug Discovery Institute (GHDDI), dedicated to tackling diseases like malaria and tuberculosis, which are often neglected due to their low profitability.

Traditional drug discovery involves sifting through millions of compounds to identify one that effectively targets a disease. This process, akin to finding a needle in a haystack, is time-consuming and inefficient.

Guo initially believed that AI could quickly identify effective compounds, similar to its high accuracy in image recognition. However, he soon realized the complexity of biological data, necessitating a multidisciplinary approach.

At GHDDI, a team integrates biology, chemistry, physics, and computer science to train AI models. These models, once refined, can screen millions of compounds in hours, significantly enhancing the discovery of potential drugs.

Furthermore, GHDDI employs generative AI, which designs new compounds tailored to specific disease targets, potentially addressing drug resistance. This advanced approach, supported by Microsoft's computational power, promises more precise and innovative drug designs.

Despite these advancements, the journey from compound discovery to a marketable drug remains challenging, involving extensive testing and regulatory hurdles.

Guo reflects on his initial naivety about drug development but remains steadfast, driven by the potential to save lives by accelerating the discovery process.

**Insight:**
The integration of AI in drug discovery represents a significant shift, not just in efficiency but in addressing diseases that have long been sidelined. This innovation not only speeds up the process but also democratizes access to medical advancements, potentially transforming global health outcomes.
