# World News Daily(2024-09-24) : Biden Administration Proposes Ban on Chinese Vehicles and Software in U.S. Cars

## Biden Administration Proposes Ban on Chinese Vehicles and Software in U.S. Cars

Biden's administration plans to ban Chinese software and hardware in U.S. vehicles, citing national security risks. The move aims to prevent data collection and potential remote control by foreign adversaries, particularly China and Russia.

The proposed regulation would bar Chinese cars from the U.S. market and force existing automakers to remove Chinese components. This includes self-driving car testing by Chinese firms.

Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo warns of extreme scenarios where foreign adversaries could control U.S. vehicles, causing crashes and roadblocks.

The U.S. has already imposed steep tariffs on Chinese imports, including electric vehicles. Raimondo emphasizes acting before Chinese and Russian components become widespread in the U.S. automotive sector.

Nearly all newer cars are "connected," with onboard network hardware for internet access. The proposal would ban existing Chinese light-duty vehicles but allow for specific exemptions.

White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan highlights evidence of China's malware in critical U.S. infrastructure. The Chinese Embassy in Washington criticizes the move, urging a level playing field for all companies.

The proposal calls for software prohibitions by the 2027 model year and hardware bans by 2030. The public has 30 days to comment, with finalization expected by January 20.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, representing major automakers, warns that changing hardware and software would take time. They note that components are developed globally, including in China, but cannot detail the prevalence of Chinese components in U.S. models.

### New Discovery: Special Cell Death Method Reveals T-Cell Anti-Tumor Mechanism, Providing New Targets for Immunotherapy

Professor Zhang Yi, Director of the Biocellular Therapy Center at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, has dedicated 35 years to research in cellular and immunotherapy. His team has achieved significant results in the field of tumor immunotherapy, filing and obtaining multiple patents, with a transformation value exceeding 80 million RMB.

Recently, Professor Zhang Yi's team discovered that the expression of phospholipid phosphatase PLPP1 in tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells is reduced, leading to T cell intolerance to unsaturated fatty acids and triggering ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is a novel form of cell death associated with increased unsaturated phospholipids.

The study revealed that PLPP1 expression is regulated by the PD-1 signaling pathway, and its levels are closely related to the efficacy of PD-1 monoclonal antibody therapy. Enhancing PLPP1 expression can strengthen T cell anti-tumor functions and improve the efficacy of PD-1 monoclonal antibodies.

The team is currently conducting translational research, including observing the impact of PLPP1 on the persistence of CAR-T cells and the cytotoxic effects of T cells overexpressing PLPP1 on different tumor cells. Additionally, they are screening for PLPP1 agonists to enhance the effectiveness of PD-1 monoclonal antibody therapy.

This research provides new targets and strategies for optimizing tumor immunotherapy, highlighting the critical role of cellular metabolism in immunotherapy.

### Tsinghua Team Develops New Oral Nanodrug for Treating Ulcerative Colitis

A research team from Tsinghua University has developed an oral nanomedicine that can precisely target the lesions of ulcerative colitis (UC), rapidly suppress inflammation, and repair the intestinal barrier. The drug achieves a dual therapeutic effect by clearing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and targeting integrins, addressing two critical issues with one solution.

Ulcerative colitis is a challenging-to-cure intestinal disease affecting over 10 million people worldwide. Traditional treatments often suffer from significant side effects and suboptimal efficacy. The new drug design addresses two major challenges: local drug delivery and immune modulation, thereby improving treatment efficacy and reducing side effects.

The research team utilized ROS-responsive ε-polylysine and low molecular weight heparin to prepare nanospheres through layer-by-layer self-assembly technology. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed the drug's high efficiency and precision.

Additionally, the study inspired the design of a probiotic delivery system, enhancing the stability and activity of probiotics in the gastrointestinal tract through surface engineering, achieving efficient colon colonization.

In the future, combining AI technology is expected to further optimize drug design and delivery systems, offering more effective treatment options for ulcerative colitis patients.

**Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)**: Active molecules produced during cellular metabolism, which can cause oxidative stress and inflammation when present in excess.

**Integrins**: Cell surface receptors involved in cell adhesion and signal transduction, highly expressed during inflammation.
