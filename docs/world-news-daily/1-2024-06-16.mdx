### French Protests Against Far-Right National Rally Gain Momentum

In Paris, a surge of protest against the far-right National Rally, fresh from European Parliament election victories, signals deep concern over impending parliamentary elections. The fear: a far-right government, a first since WWII.

French unions, antiracism groups, and a newly-formed left-wing coalition rally, urging a democratic and social upsurge to counter the National Rally's momentum. They warn of extreme-right policies detrimental to marginalized communities globally.

Left-wing parties, setting aside international conflict differences, coalesce to thwart the National Rally, which polls predict will lead in the first parliamentary election round.

President Macron, despite retaining foreign and defense powers, faces a weakened presidency if the National Rally prevails, potentially elevating their young leader, Jordan Bardella, to prime minister, with control over domestic and economic policies.

The stakes are high; the outcome could redefine France's political landscape and echo internationally.

### Study on the Impact of Father's Pre-Conception Diet on Children's Health

<img

  alt="Study on the Impact of Father's Pre-Conception Diet on Children's Health"
/>

New research reveals that a father's diet before conception significantly impacts his child's health, particularly in the risk of metabolic diseases. Led by Dr. Rafael Tapperino, studies at Munich's Helmholtz Center focused on small RNA molecules in sperm, known as mt-tsRNAs, which regulate gene expression and influence health traits across generations.

The study, utilizing data from over 3000 families in the LIFE Child Cohort, found that paternal weight directly affects a child's weight and susceptibility to metabolic diseases, independent of maternal factors or genetics. Further experiments with mice fed a high-fat diet demonstrated increased metabolic disease risks in offspring, confirming the impact of paternal diet on reproductive cells.

Notably, the research highlighted the role of mt-tsRNAs, which are fragments of mitochondrial tRNA. Mitochondria, often termed the cell's powerhouse, possess their own DNA (mtDNA) and RNA, traditionally thought to be solely maternally inherited. However, recent findings show that sperm carries mt-RNA into the egg, influencing early embryonic gene expression and, consequently, offspring health.

This study underscores the importance of paternal preconception health, particularly diet, in mitigating risks of obesity and diabetes in children. It challenges traditional views on mitochondrial inheritance, emphasizing the paternal contribution to offspring's metabolic health through indirect genetic mechanisms.

In a market increasingly focused on affordability, Starbucks is experiencing declining sales and is adapting by discreetly lowering prices through promotions and discounts. Despite founder Howard Schultz's hesitance to engage in price wars, Starbucks' actions indicate a different approach. The brand's traditional premium positioning is challenged by competitors like Luckin Coffee, which provide similar quality at more affordable prices. Starbucks' strategy includes expanding into lower-tier cities and launching new products to recapture market share, yet challenges remain as consumer preferences shift towards value.

Starbucks' predicament mirrors a broader trend in consumer markets where premium brands must balance their upscale image with the rising demand for cost-effective options. The tactic of "stealth pricing," involving hidden price reductions through deals and offers, allows Starbucks to explore market responses without fully undermining its luxury brand status. However, this strategy may offer only temporary respite. Long-term success depends on Starbucks' ability to innovate and deliver exceptional value that validates its price point, without alienating its core customer base that seeks both quality and affordability.
