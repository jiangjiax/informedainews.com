# World News Daily(2024-07-02) : EU Finds Meta's 'Pay or Consent' Model Violates Competition Rules

## EU Finds Meta's 'Pay or Consent' Model Violates Competition Rules

European Commission says Meta's "pay or consent" model breaks EU rules. Meta, owner of Facebook and Instagram, asks users in Europe to either accept being tracked for ads or pay to avoid them. The EU sees this as forcing users into a corner.

The Digital Markets Act (DMA) aims to stop big tech companies from using their power unfairly. Meta, seen as a "gatekeeper," needs user permission to track them. The EU thinks Meta isn't giving a real choice.

Meta could face big fines—up to 10% of its global income. The EU wants Meta to offer a free version with less personalized ads, not just a paid one. Meta argues it's following EU court rules, but the EU says Meta must explain why it doesn't offer a free, less personalized ad option.

The investigation isn't over, but the EU plans to finish by March 2025. Consumer groups are happy with the EU's move.

### Hurricane Beryl Threatens Southeastern Caribbean as Category 3 Storm

Hurricane Beryl, a Category 3 storm, targets the southeast Caribbean. It's the earliest Category 4 Atlantic hurricane on record, fueled by unusually warm waters. Hurricane warnings cover Barbados, Grenada, St. Lucia, Tobago, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves of St. Vincent and the Grenadines urges residents to stay indoors.

Beryl's winds peak at 120 mph, moving west at 20 mph. It's compact, with hurricane-force winds extending 35 miles from its center. Tropical storm warnings are in effect for Martinique and Trinidad, with watches issued for Dominica and Haiti’s southern coast.

Forecasters predict a life-threatening storm surge up to 9 feet, with heavy rainfall potentially reaching 10 inches in some areas, especially in Grenada and the Grenadines. The National Hurricane Center warns of a very dangerous situation.

Beryl is expected to weaken slightly but remain a significant hurricane as it moves across the Caribbean, potentially impacting Jamaica and Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula. Officials in affected areas have shut down electricity, warned of water outages, and closed schools, airports, and government offices.

Beryl strengthened rapidly, becoming a major hurricane in just 42 hours, a rare feat in Atlantic hurricane history. Its formation is linked to record-warm waters, hotter than typical peak hurricane season temperatures.

As Beryl approaches, residents and visitors brace for impact, with many fearing the worst despite preparations. The storm underscores the heightened threat of hurricane activity this season, with NOAA predicting well above-average activity.

### Boston Celtics NBA Championship Team Up for Sale

Boston Celtics, NBA champions, are up for sale. The ownership group plans to sell all shares by 2024-2025, with the final sale expected in 2028. With 18 NBA titles, the Celtics could be valued at over $4 billion, similar to the Phoenix Suns' sale in 2023. Wyc Grousbeck, who purchased the team for $360 million in 2002, will remain as governor until 2028.

Brain-controlled bionic leg boosts amputees' speed and ease of movement. Trial results show 41% faster walking and better stair navigation.

The device uses the wearer's thoughts to flex, point, and rotate the foot, resulting in a more natural gait and improved stability on uneven terrain.

Prof Hugh Herr, co-director of MIT's K Lisa Yang Center for Bionics, leads the study. Herr, a double amputee, plans to use the technology himself.

Trial participants reported less pain and muscle atrophy, feeling that their prosthetic was part of their body, not just a tool.

A new surgery, the agonist-antagonist myoneural interface (AMI), preserves muscle connections, allowing the monitoring and translation of muscle contractions into ankle movements.

Dr. Sigrid Dupan, from University College Dublin, highlights the significance of terrain adaptability.

The MIT team aims to commercialize the leg within five years, with Herr envisioning a major step-change in clinical care for amputees worldwide.

### The New York Times' Game App Wins Apple Design Award

The New York Times has won Apple's Design Award for the "Fun to Play" category with its game app, NYT Games. This app originated from its crossword puzzles and has since expanded to include games like Wordle and Spelling Bee. Crossword puzzles were invented in 1913 by Arthur Wynne of The New York World. Initially, The New York Times was critical of crossword puzzles, but during World War II, they became a tool for escapism and were eventually incorporated into the newspaper.

The success of NYT Games lies in its meticulous design, which enhances the replayability of the games. The New York Times has viewed its gaming business as a new growth area by acquiring and integrating popular games. Currently, NYT Games has over 1 million downloads per month, five times that of The New York Times app, generating nearly $2 million in monthly revenue on the App Store, accounting for 28.69% of the revenue from "The New York Times" family of apps.

In this world filled with uncertainties, games have become a way for people to escape reality. This transformation by The New York Times not only boosts revenue but also reflects the trend of convergence between media and entertainment.

### Jiangsu will include assisted reproduction and painless childbirth in the medical insurance.

Starting from July 1, Jiangsu Province will include 13 types of assisted reproductive services and painless childbirth in the medical insurance coverage. This move aims to support childbearing and promote balanced population development.

Assisted reproductive services include techniques such as artificial insemination and in vitro fertilization, intended to help infertile couples. Painless childbirth involves intrathecal analgesia to alleviate the pain of childbirth for mothers.

By covering these services under medical insurance, the cost of childbirth is reduced, meeting the needs of more families. Huai'an City has also implemented a policy where newborns are "insured upon birth," further streamlining the process and enhancing the effectiveness of fertility support policies.

### North Carolina's Plan to Erase $4 Billion in Medical Debt

North Carolina plans to eliminate $4 billion in medical debt for 2 million residents. Governor Roy Cooper's proposal offers hospitals additional federal Medicaid funds if they cancel old debts and assist future patients with discounts. Hospitals must also cease selling debt to collectors and cap interest rates.

The plan does not require the state to spend extra funds and needs federal approval. If approved, hospitals could receive up to $6.5 billion next year. Benefits for patients would commence in 2025-2026.

This initiative focuses on long-term debt relief, contrasting with one-time federal fund usage by other states. It supports low- and middle-income families, potentially stimulating the state's economy.

**Explanation of Terms:**
- **Medicaid Reimbursement Funds:** Money provided by the federal government to states to assist in covering healthcare services for low-income individuals.
- **Charity Care Programs:** Services provided by hospitals at reduced costs or free of charge to patients who cannot afford care.

### Biniam Girmay Makes History as First Black African to Win Tour de France Stage

Biniam Girmay, an Eritrean cyclist, made history by winning the third stage of the Tour de France, becoming the first Black African to do so. His victory, he said, was for all Africans, signaling a significant moment for the continent in the world of cycling.

Girmay had previously made headlines by winning a stage at the Giro d’Italia, another prestigious race, but his celebration was cut short when a prosecco cork struck his eye, necessitating hospitalization and forcing him to withdraw from the race.

In this Tour de France stage, Girmay edged out Fernando Gaviria and Arnaud De Lie in a close finish. Meanwhile, Mark Cavendish, aiming for a record-breaking 35th stage win, was delayed by a crash but maintained his position due to race rules.

Richard Carapaz, an Olympic champion, took the yellow jersey, becoming the first Ecuadorean to lead the race.

Morus, a Japanese startup, plans to sell silkworm-based food in Singapore. The city-state is set to legalize edible insects this year. CEO Ryo Sato aims to export powdered silkworms and protein products, touting them as a new protein source. Silkworms offer more protein than chicken, with lower fat and calories. Production costs are also lower than cultured meat.

Sato envisions broader uses for silkworms, including feed and preventive medicine. Morus, founded in 2021 at Shinshu University, established a Singapore subsidiary in February, drawn by government support programs. The company also eyes Southeast Asia for expansion.

Singapore, with a low food self-sufficiency rate, supports alternative protein startups. In 2020, it approved cultured meat sales, a world first. Last year, the Singapore Food Agency announced plans to allow 16 insect types for human consumption, including silkworms and crickets. Regulations are being formulated to ensure safety.

Asian countries like Thailand and South Korea already consume certain insects. Vietnam's Cricket One also plans to enter the Singapore market.
