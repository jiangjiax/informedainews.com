Hezbollah drones struck an Israeli army base near Binyamina, killing four soldiers and severely wounding seven others. The attack, claimed as retaliation for Israeli strikes on Beirut, marked Hezbollah's deadliest since Israel's invasion of Lebanon. The assault involved dozens of missiles and "squadrons" of drones, some of which were used for the first time, targeting Israel's elite Golani brigade.

Israel's national rescue service reported 61 wounded, a rare occurrence given the country's advanced air-defence systems. Tensions have escalated since the Gaza war began a year ago.

In response, the U.S. plans to deploy a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile system to Israel, along with about 100 troops. THAAD is a sophisticated missile defence system with six truck-mounted launchers, each carrying eight interceptors, and a powerful radar.

Iran's foreign minister warned that U.S. troops could be at risk. Hezbollah threatened more attacks if Israel's offensive in Lebanon continues.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned attacks on peacekeepers in Lebanon. Israel's prime minister called for UNIFIL troops to evacuate Hezbollah strongholds.

In Gaza, an Israeli airstrike killed at least 20, including children, at a school sheltering displaced Palestinians.

SpaceX's Starship rocket achieved a significant milestone with its fifth test flight, successfully capturing the Super Heavy booster with a mechanical arm after separation at 74 kilometers. This marks a first in aerospace engineering.

Dan Huot, SpaceX's communications manager, described the event as "magic." Engineers Kate Tice and Jessie Anderson expressed profound emotion, with Tice calling it a historic moment. Elon Musk, SpaceX's founder, celebrated the precise landing of the second-stage spacecraft in the Indian Ocean, emphasizing the step towards multi-planetary life.

NASA Administrator Bill Nelson congratulated SpaceX, highlighting the importance of ongoing tests for future missions to the Moon and Mars. The success is expected to reduce spaceflight costs and bolster confidence in Musk's plan for manned Mars missions within four years.

A Pew Research study indicates that 69% of Americans value maintaining leadership in space, with 47% acknowledging SpaceX's significant contributions.

As the U.S. presidential election nears, Musk's support for Republican candidate Trump could sway tech-savvy voters. Trump praised Musk and the Starship's achievement, contrasting with Biden and Harris's silence on the matter.

The FAA's last-minute approval for the test flight underscores the rapid advancements in SpaceX's technology, despite regulatory hurdles like the California Coastal Commission's rejection of increased launch requests due to environmental concerns.

### Michael Cohen's Legal Battle Against Trump Revived by Supreme Court

Michael Cohen, Donald Trump's former lawyer, seeks to revive a lawsuit alleging that Trump sent him back to prison in retaliation for writing a tell-all book. Cohen's appeal, now before the Supreme Court, aims to deter federal officials from unconstitutional actions. The justices will discuss the case on October 18.

Cohen, who was disbarred and disgraced, served three years for crimes related to his work for Trump. He aligns with civil rights advocates in challenging the Supreme Court's hostility to claims against federal officials.

Cohen was held in solitary confinement for 16 days after refusing to sign a form restricting his media access. A federal judge later ruled that the government retaliated against him for exercising his free speech rights.

Cohen's lawsuit targets Trump, former Attorney General William Barr, and others, seeking damages for Fourth Amendment violations. The Supreme Court rarely takes up appeals, and Cohen's lawyer admits it's an uphill battle.

Recent court rulings, like Egbert v. Boule, have weakened Bivens claims—civil rights lawsuits against federal officials. Cohen's case exemplifies how federal officials can violate the Constitution with impunity.

Both Joe Biden's and Donald Trump's administrations oppose Cohen's appeal. Trump's lawyer argues that he has immunity from suit for actions taken in office.

Cohen compares his experience to critics of Russian President Vladimir Putin, emphasizing the importance of deterring such actions.

### Li Chuanliang Corruption Case: The Interweaving of Power and Greed

Li Chuanliang, the former deputy mayor of Jixi City, is involved in a corruption case and has absconded overseas.

During his tenure, he embezzled and defrauded public property worth nearly 3 billion yuan, accepted bribes totaling nearly 50 million yuan, and misappropriated public funds amounting to 110 million yuan.

He owns 18 companies spanning multiple sectors including energy and real estate, with actual control over their equity.

After the case was exposed, assets worth 1.4 billion yuan were seized, including 1,021 properties, 27 plots of land and tidal flats, 8 forest plots, 38 vehicles, and 10 pieces of machinery and equipment.

In 2014, he transferred 5 million yuan in illicit funds to Hong Kong, involving Sun Chengxiang, the general manager of Jixi Binhang Special Automobile Co., Ltd., and Dong Yujun, a cadre from the Jixi Finance Bureau.

### Unidentified Drones Swarm U.S. Military Base for 17 Days

In Virginia, a swarm of unidentified drones hovered over a military base for 17 days. The area included the home of SEAL Team Six and Naval Station Norfolk, the world's largest naval port. This occurred just months after the U.S. shot down a Chinese spy balloon.

The drones, some 20 feet long and flying at over 100 mph, baffled officials. Meetings were held with experts from the Defense Department, FBI, and Pentagon's UFO office. Federal law prevents the military from shooting down drones unless they pose an imminent threat.

Two months earlier, five drones flew over a Nevada site used for nuclear-weapons experiments. The operators remain unknown.

The Virginia drones appeared at dusk, vanished each night, and were nearly impossible to track. Langley Air Force Base canceled nighttime training and moved F-22 jets.

In January, a University of Minnesota student, Fengyun Shi, was arrested. His drone, stuck in a tree, had photographed Navy vessels. Shi claimed to be a ship enthusiast and unaware of restricted airspace. He was sentenced to six months in prison.

Despite Shi's arrest, the mystery of the Virginia drones remains unsolved. More unidentified drone swarms have been spotted near Edwards Air Force Base.

**Key Terms:**
- **SEAL Team Six:** Elite U.S. Navy special operations unit.
- **Naval Station Norfolk:** Largest naval base in the world.
- **F-22:** Advanced U.S. fighter jet.
- **Edwards Air Force Base:** Major U.S. Air Force base in California.

### Meta's Oversight Board Expands with European Center to Handle Content Disputes

Meta's Oversight Board is expanding with a new European center to handle content disputes on platforms like TikTok and YouTube. This center will operate under Europe's Digital Services Act, which mandates that tech companies allow users to appeal account restrictions through an independent group.

Thomas Hughes, CEO of Appeals Centre Europe, calls this a "game changer" for platform accountability and transparency. The Oversight Board, an independent body funded by Meta, has been trying to expand its influence beyond Meta itself. Both the Appeals Centre Europe and the Oversight Board aim to improve user redress, transparency, and uphold users' rights online.

European users can appeal content removals to the center and flag posts they believe violate rules. While the center's decisions are nonbinding, they will generate data that could influence regulators and the public. In contrast, the Oversight Board's decisions on Meta content are binding.

The Appeals Centre Europe will start with an initial grant but will later be funded by fees from social media companies, around 90 euros per case. This setup ensures the center's independence and sustainability.

  alt="Japan's First Railway: A Journey Through 150 Years of History"
/>

On October 14, 1872, Japan's first railway, connecting Tokyo and Yokohama, commenced. The inaugural train carried Emperor Meiji from Shimbashi to Yokohama. This railway was a pivotal symbol of modernization.

British explorer Isabella Bird, who traveled Japan in 1878, described the railway's amenities: hourly service, tiered waiting rooms, luggage handling, and European-style carriages. First and second-class cars were luxurious but sparsely used; third-class was crowded.

The original Shimbashi station is now Shiodome, and Yokohama's terminal was Sakuragicho. Railways spurred economic growth and territorial expansion.

By 1900, railways were integral to Japanese life. The song "Tetsudō Uta" celebrated this, starting with "A whistle echoes through Shimbashi." In 1995, Japan designated October 14 as "Railway Day."

In 2022, Japan commemorated the 150th anniversary with special trains and exhibitions. The National Archives showcased historical documents, including an 1882 timetable detailing fares, rules, and smoking cars.

Today, digital "transfer guides" like Yahoo! Japan and Jordan offer real-time train info. Jordan even simulated the 1872 railway experience digitally.

Railways transformed Japan, linking its past and present.

In July 2024, Wayanad, Kerala, faced devastating floods and landslides, claiming over 200 lives. The Union Ministry of Earth Sciences responded by approving an X-band radar for the district. This radar, crucial for monitoring weather and predicting natural disasters, operates by emitting radio waves to gauge the distance, velocity, and characteristics of objects like clouds.

**Doppler Radar**: Uses the Doppler effect to measure cloud movement and speed. It emits pulses to gauge rainfall intensity, aiding in storm and wind pattern prediction.

**X-band Radar**: Emits radiation in the 8-12 GHz range, ideal for detecting small particles like rain droplets. It offers high-resolution images but has a shorter range. In Wayanad, it will monitor soil movements, crucial for landslide warnings.

India's radar history began in the 1950s with the IMD. The first indigenous X-band radar was installed in Delhi in 1970. By 2024, India plans to add 56 Doppler radars, part of the ₹2,000-crore 'Mission Mausam'. This initiative includes 10 X-band radars for the northeast and Himachal Pradesh.

**NISAR**: A joint NASA-ISRO satellite project, set for launch in 2025. It will use L-band and S-band radars to map Earth's landmasses, tracking natural processes.

The deployment of advanced radars underscores India's commitment to enhancing weather forecasting and disaster preparedness.

Hong Kong is diving headfirst into digital tokens to modernize its financial sector. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched Project Ensemble Sandbox, aiming to make transactions faster, cheaper, and more transparent.

Tokenization—turning assets into digital tokens—could slash transaction times from days to seconds. Bonds, funds, and even carbon credits are set to be tokenized. This tech promises to boost efficiency and reduce fraud in trade finance.

Big players like the Bank of China, HSBC, and Standard Chartered are on board. Microsoft and Alibaba’s Ant Digital are also in the mix.

Hong Kong’s move mirrors China’s broader strategy to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar. After being caught off guard by Western sanctions on Russia, China sees digital finance as a way to counter dollar dominance.

Despite past crypto bans, China seems to tacitly support Hong Kong’s tokenization push. The city, once a gateway to the West, now finds itself at the forefront of China’s financial ambitions.

As tensions with the U.S. rise, Hong Kong’s future as a financial hub hinges on its ability to innovate. The city’s bet on digital tokens could be its ticket to staying relevant in a rapidly changing world.

Nasa's Europa Clipper is set to launch on October 14, 2024, from Kennedy Space Center. The mission aims to explore Jupiter's moon Europa, where a vast ocean lies beneath its icy surface. This ocean could harbor life.

The spacecraft, weighing six tons, will travel nearly 2 billion miles over six years to reach Europa. It will carry nine instruments, including cameras and radar, to study the moon's surface and subsurface.

Europa Clipper will not directly search for life but will look for signs of habitability, such as organic compounds and gases. The mission seeks to determine if Europa is habitable now, not just in the past.

The spacecraft faces significant challenges, including extreme radiation from Jupiter's magnetic field. To protect its electronics, Europa Clipper will orbit Jupiter and conduct 49 flybys of Europa, each exposing it to radiation equivalent to 1 million chest X-rays.

Despite these risks, the mission is crucial. Europa's ocean holds twice as much water as Earth's, making it a prime candidate for extraterrestrial life. The UK Space Agency has also invested in a related mission, ESA's Juice probe, set to arrive at Jupiter in 2031.

Together, these missions could provide definitive proof of habitable worlds beyond Earth within the next decade.
