Ukrainian authorities have ordered the mandatory evacuation of Kupiansk, a city in the north-eastern Kharkiv region, as Russian forces close in. The city, recaptured by Ukraine in 2022, faces severe winter challenges due to constant shelling, making it impossible to restore essential services like electricity, heat, and water.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been invited to present his "victory plan" to EU leaders, focusing on military support and energy grid reinforcement. Meanwhile, the US expresses concern over reports of North Korean soldiers fighting for Russia in Ukraine, signaling a potential new level of desperation for Moscow.

In Kyiv, a drone attack prompted officials to urge residents to seek shelter. Elsewhere, a Russian man jailed for his daughter's anti-war drawing was released, highlighting the harsh conditions faced by political prisoners.

Spanish authorities arrested four individuals suspected of running a sanctions-bypassing network, seizing 13 tonnes of chemical products bound for Russia. A survey revealed that four-fifths of Ukrainians support a law banning Russia-affiliated religious groups, reflecting ongoing tensions.

Russia is reducing its consular staff in Norway, and its Olympic chief is stepping down due to "geopolitical challenges," including the ban on Russian teams at the Paris Olympics.

**Insights:**
The situation in Ukraine remains dire, with both military and humanitarian crises deepening. International responses, from diplomatic expulsions to sanctions, indicate a global effort to pressure Russia. The personal stories, like that of the jailed father, underscore the human cost of the conflict.

Trump's PAC has collected $7.5 million in crypto donations since June. The contributions include bitcoin, ether, XRP, and stablecoins tether and USDC. The funds were raised between July 1 and September 30.

As the 2024 election approaches, Trump has positioned himself as the pro-crypto candidate, marking a shift from his earlier stance during his presidency. In May, he became the first major presidential candidate to accept digital token donations.

The crypto industry has contributed nearly half of all corporate election funds to the race. Major contributors include Coinbase, Ripple, and venture firm Andreessen Horowitz. The industry's donations are 13 times higher than in the last presidential election.

At least 18 donors gave over $5.5 million in bitcoin, with another seven contributing $1.5 million in ether. Contributors hail from over 15 states, including battlegrounds like Puerto Rico.

David Bailey, CEO of BTC Inc., donated $498,000 in bitcoin. Bailey and other crypto enthusiasts converted Trump from a skeptic to an evangelist. This culminated in Trump headlining a major bitcoin conference in Nashville.

New donor Chase Herro co-founded World Liberty Financial, a decentralized bank. The platform launched its token sale, raising over $10.2 million, though short of its $300 million goal.

Prominent donors include Mike Belshe of BitGo, Brian Murray of Craft Ventures, and Trevor Traina of Kresus Labs. Ripple's Stuart Alderoty contributed $300,000 in XRP.

In contrast, Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen donated $1 million in XRP to a PAC supporting Kamala Harris. Larsen cited Harris's understanding of the innovation economy as a reason for his support.

Billionaire twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss have led pro-Trump crypto contributions, each donating nearly $1.1 million. Some funds were refunded due to exceeding maximum limits.

Nedd Brockmann, a 25-year-old electrician, completed a 1,000-mile charity run at Sydney Olympic Park, raising over $2.6 million for Australians experiencing homelessness. Despite falling short of the world record by half a day, his effort was hailed as "Australian of the year type shit" by Dylan Alcott. Brockmann averaged 128km per day, enduring severe blisters and swelling that increased his shoe size by three. His run, live-streamed on TikTok, garnered over 350,000 views and inspired thousands.

Brockmann's journey, though painful, exemplified grit and tenacity. Corrina Black, Vice President of the Australian Ultra and Trail Runners Association, noted that his run underscored the accessibility of ultra running and its potential to inspire and raise funds. Brockmann's previous 4,000km run in 2022 had already raised $1.85 million for We Are Mobilise, an outreach program combating homelessness.

In Hemingway's style, Brockmann's run is a stark testament to human endurance and the power of perseverance. His tears at the finish line speak volumes about the physical and emotional toll, yet his achievement resonates with a broader message of hope and resilience.

  alt="UK Inflation Drops Below 2% for First Time in Three and a Half Years"
/>

UK inflation dropped to 1.7%, the lowest in three and a half years. This fall, driven by lower air fares and petrol prices, marks the first time it’s below the Bank of England’s 2% target since 2021.

The decline gives a boost to Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who aims to protect household incomes and repair public services in her upcoming budget. Lower inflation supports her goal but also pressures the Bank to cut interest rates.

The pound weakened against the dollar and euro, while UK borrowing costs fell. Darren Jones, Treasury chief, welcomed the news but emphasized the need for continued economic stability.

Petrol prices dropped due to lower crude oil costs, offsetting rising food prices. Economists predict a November interest rate cut to 4.75%.

Investors warn of potential inflation reversal due to energy price cap hikes. The budget will be crucial in assessing its impact on inflation.

Benefits will rise less than expected, disadvantaging many households. The state pension, however, will increase significantly due to the “triple lock” policy.

Lower inflation and borrowing costs could benefit public finances but may also signal economic weakness. Reeves faces pressure to boost living standards and repair public services.

The budget aims to address a £22bn fiscal gap, with potential tax rises and spending cuts. The TUC urges a focus on economic growth to rebuild the economy.

  alt="China Leading the Shift to an 'Age of Electricity,' IEA Reports"
/>

The energy market is transitioning to an "age of electricity," led by China, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Global electricity demand is expected to nearly double by 2050, driven by China's rapid adoption of electric vehicles, increased cooling needs, and data center expansion. China is responsible for two-thirds of this growth.

Clean energy is replacing fossil fuels, but the speed of this transition raises concerns about meeting emission reduction targets. Low-emission energy output increased by 4,800 terawatt-hours (tWh) from 2010 to 2023, while electricity generation surged by 8,400 tWh. China's role is crucial; its clean energy capacity accounts for 60% of global additions in 2023.

Despite this, China remains the largest coal consumer, expected to account for over half of global demand by 2035. India and Southeast Asia also heavily rely on coal, though their clean power generation is growing.

Asia is now the focal point of global oil and gas trade, with China poised to overtake the U.S. as the largest oil consumer by 2030. Electric vehicle (EV) sales are surging, particularly in China, where nearly 70% of new car sales could be electric by 2030.

The IEA warns of "perilous times" in energy security due to conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine. A special summit on energy security is planned for London in 2025.

**Key Terms:**
- **Terawatt-hours (tWh):** A unit of energy equal to one trillion watt-hours.
- **Low-emission energy:** Energy sources that produce minimal greenhouse gas emissions, such as solar and wind power.
- **Carbon intensity targets:** Goals set by countries to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide emitted per unit of economic activity.

Generative AI startups are raking in venture capital, grabbing 40% of all cloud-related investments. Accel's Euroscape report reveals a projected $79.2 billion in funding for cloud startups in the U.S., Europe, and Israel this year, driven by AI.

Cloud funding surged 27% annually, marking the first growth in three years. In 2023, cloud startups raised $62.5 billion, up 65% from four years ago. OpenAI, creator of ChatGPT, recently secured $6.6 billion, valuing the company at $157 billion.

AI is dominating cloud investments. Philippe Botteri of Accel notes, "AI is sucking the air out of the room." The Euroscape index, tracking public cloud firms, rose 19% year-over-year, lagging behind the Nasdaq's 38% increase.

Beyond AI, cloud firms face challenges: enterprise software budgets are squeezed by macroeconomic and geopolitical risks. Only one company in Accel's index saw revenue growth over 40% this year, compared to 23 in 2021.

Generative AI firms, particularly those building foundational models, are attracting significant funding. OpenAI led with $18.9 billion, followed by Anthropic and Elon Musk's xAI. In Europe, Wayve, Mistral, and Aleph Alpha secured the most funding.

The U.S. dominates global generative AI investment, with 80% of $56 billion going to American firms. Big Tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta are each investing $30-60 billion annually in AI.

Dev Ittycheria of MongoDB predicts a consolidation of powerful AI models to a few major players, driven by access to capital for data centers and chips.

  alt="2024 Physics Nobel Prize: Pioneers in Neural Networks"
/>

In 2024, the Nobel Physics Prize was awarded to John J. Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton, pioneers in neural networks. This choice, though surprising, reflects the growing intersection of physics and AI.

Hopfield, a former solid-state physicist, introduced the Hopfield network in 1982. This model uses an energy function to simulate memory and association in the brain, akin to spin glass systems in physics.

Hinton, inspired by Hopfield, developed the Boltzmann Machine in 1985. This stochastic network applies statistical mechanics, using concepts like Boltzmann distribution and simulated annealing to optimize neural networks.

Their work bridged physics and AI, using energy functions and statistical mechanics to model complex systems. This approach has influenced fields like deep learning, where Hinton's innovations, including Deep Belief Networks and Contrastive Divergence, revolutionized AI.

Their contributions extend beyond AI. They've enriched physics by applying its principles to new domains, like biophysics and information physics. Their methods, such as neural network models and optimization algorithms, have become tools in modern physics research.

This cross-disciplinary impact is evident in recent computer vision advancements. Techniques like model merging and diffusion models, which blend physical principles with AI, are pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

In essence, Hopfield and Hinton's legacy is a testament to the power of interdisciplinary collaboration, where insights from one field can unlock new frontiers in another.

### James Webb Telescope Captures Rare View of Young Exoplanet AF Lep b

Astronomers recently used the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to capture a rare glimpse of the young gas planet AF Lep b, located 88 light-years away. This exoplanet, just 23 million years old, is nearing its star, making it invisible for over a decade. The JWST's coronagraph blocked 90% of the star's light, allowing the telescope to detect AF Lep b's faint glow.

The JWST's spectrograph revealed that AF Lep b, three times the mass of Jupiter, has a very active atmosphere, containing carbon monoxide. This discovery suggests strong updrafts in the planet's atmosphere.

The JWST, a collaboration between NASA, ESA, and the Canadian Space Agency, is designed to peer into the deepest parts of the cosmos. Its giant mirror, over 21 feet across, captures more light than the Hubble Space Telescope, enabling it to observe ancient stars and galaxies. Unlike Hubble, which primarily views visible light, the JWST is an infrared telescope, allowing it to see through cosmic clouds.

This technology also allows the JWST to analyze the atmospheres of distant exoplanets, identifying molecules like water, carbon dioxide, and methane. Astronomers are excited about the potential discoveries to come, not just about known planets, but also about those yet to be discovered.

In summary, the JWST's recent observations of AF Lep b mark a significant step in our understanding of exoplanets and the cosmos. The telescope's capabilities promise even more groundbreaking discoveries in the future.

### Han Kang's Nobel Win: A Feminist Triumph in South Korea

Han Kang's Nobel Prize in Literature marks South Korea's cultural ascendancy. She's the first Korean and Asian woman to win. This follows Bong Joon Ho's "Parasite" Oscar and K-pop's global success.

Han's win reflects South Korea's female writers' rise, especially in translation. Yet, it also underscores the nation's deep patriarchy. Only one Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism head has been female since 2008.

For Han and other female writers, writing is a form of dissent. Han's "Human Acts" chronicles the 1980 Gwangju massacre. The Park Geun-hye government blacklisted her.

Han's "The Vegetarian" explores domestic violence. Her work draws from South Korea's history of human violence. She avoids celebratory events, citing global conflicts.

In South Korea, women face discrimination in politics, business, and media. Literature offers a feminist outlet. It's one of the few spaces where gender constraints are lifted.

Han's Nobel win isn't just a cultural milestone. It's a feminist triumph in a patriarchal society.

In Tokyo, more women are freezing their eggs, driven by societal pressures and government subsidies. At 39, my friend grapples with the decision, torn between personal desires and parental expectations. She wants a child someday but isn’t ready now. Egg freezing offers a compromise, a way to appease her parents without immediate commitment.

Japanese women face unique pressures. Historically, they had little say in marriage and childbirth. Today, they navigate a complex landscape where societal norms clash with individual choices. The government’s recent push to subsidize egg freezing reflects a broader effort to address the plummeting birth rate. Yet, this initiative also highlights the double standards: men face less scrutiny for delaying parenthood.

Tokyo’s governor, Yuriko Koike, tried matchmaking but stumbled. Now, she supports egg freezing, offering up to 300,000 yen ($2,020) per woman. Over 10,000 women have applied, seeking guidance through counseling sessions.

While egg freezing provides options, it’s not without risks. The process becomes more costly and physically challenging with age. The Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology warns against unconditional endorsement.

Despite these challenges, Japanese women have made strides. Maternity leave and childcare have improved, though old biases persist. Working mothers still face criticism, a remnant of outdated attitudes.

In essence, egg freezing is a modern solution to an ancient dilemma. It offers women a way to control their reproductive futures, even as societal expectations loom large.

  alt="Novo Nordisk Halts Insulin Pen Production, Patients in Developing Countries Affected"

Novo Nordisk, a pharmaceutical giant, has halted production of insulin pens, forcing type 1 diabetes patients in developing countries to revert to using glass vials and syringes. These patients argue that this shift is inconvenient and less accurate. Novo Nordisk claims the move is due to "capacity constraints," but critics suggest it prioritizes the production of weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, which are more profitable.

Lecritia Roberts, a South African with type 1 diabetes, recalls the difficulties of using vials as a teenager. She emphasizes the convenience and discreetness of insulin pens, which are now being taken away. A survey by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and T1International found that 82% of patients prefer pens over syringes and vials.

Novo Nordisk will continue producing pens for more expensive, synthetic insulin, which is out of reach for many in developing countries. Candice Sehoma, from MSF, criticizes the company for creating unequal care globally. Novo Nordisk denies the move is profit-driven, but the timing coincides with a $4 billion investment in a US plant to boost production of weight-loss drugs.

The original insulin patent was assigned to the University of Toronto to ensure accessibility. Today, three companies control over 90% of insulin production, including the new weight-loss drugs. MSF calls for lower prices on all insulin devices, suggesting they could still be profitable at $1 per pen.
