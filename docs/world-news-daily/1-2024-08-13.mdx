Pakistan's army arrested Faiz Hameed, the former chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), on August 13, 2024. Hameed, a retired Lieutenant General, is facing a military court martial for a property case and banned political activities post-retirement. This marks the first arrest of a former ISI chief in Pakistan's history.

The ISI, known for its significant political influence, has often been linked to the rise and fall of governments. Hameed's arrest signals a strict adherence to military laws and serves as a warning to politicians, including jailed ex-Prime Minister Imran Khan, that no one is above the law.

Hameed was involved in a land development scandal, accused of orchestrating a raid on a housing company executive's properties. His association with Khan, who was ousted in 2022 and arrested in 2023 on graft and state secrets charges, further complicates the political landscape.

Khan's supporters reacted violently to Hameed's arrest, attacking military installations. The army holds Khan responsible for these attacks, demanding an apology, which he has refused. Hameed's trial serves as a stark reminder to Khan and his allies of the military's resolve.

### "Japan's Ambitious Plan to Lead in Advanced Microchip Production"

Japan once ruled the semiconductor world. In the 1980s, they had over half the market. But shifts happened. Taiwan, with TSMC, and the U.S., with design expertise, took the lead. The Netherlands' ASML chipped in with crucial manufacturing tools.

Now, Japan aims to reclaim its throne. Rapidus Corporation, a 2022 joint venture, is their spearhead. They plan to produce 2 nanometer chips by 2027, chasing TSMC and Samsung.

Semiconductors are everywhere—smartphones, running shoes, even in the burgeoning field of Gen AI. They're divided into logic chips (processors) and memory chips (data storage).

Japan's fall from dominance came from political hits, like U.S. tariffs, and a shift in industry strategy towards specialization. The old model of design and manufacture under one roof gave way to focused roles.

Japan's push is backed by hefty government subsidies. Their goal: to innovate and manufacture at the cutting edge once more.

### Liquid Water Discovered Deep in Martian Rocks

NASA's Insight lander discovered liquid water deep within Mars' crust. The lander, operational from 2018 to 2022, utilized a seismometer to detect Mars quakes, uncovering seismic signals indicative of water. This marks the first direct evidence of liquid water on Mars, located at depths ranging from 10 to 20 kilometers.

This discovery provides insight into the fate of Mars' ancient water. While some of it evaporated into space, a significant portion likely remains buried underground. This finding poses challenges for Mars colonization plans, as accessing this water would necessitate deep drilling into the planet's crust.

The existence of liquid water deep beneath the surface could also suggest potential habitats for life, indicating that future Mars missions may concentrate on exploring these subterranean environments.

Scientists at Shanghai Jiao Tong University have developed a new approach to cancer treatment. They've created an "artificial metabzyme," mimicking a natural enzyme called xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR). This new tool tweaks tumor cell metabolism, triggering an immune response that targets cancer cells specifically.

Traditional cancer treatments often cause side effects and drug resistance. This new method, detailed in Nature Nanotechnology, uses the tumor's own metabolic changes to signal immune cells, enhancing their ability to attack the cancer.

The team, led by Professors Ling Daishun and Li Fangyuan, synthesized a catalyst called FeMoO4. This catalyst acts like XOR, but with precision targeting capabilities. It alters the metabolism of tumor cells, producing signals that activate nearby immune cells, turning them against the cancer.

This research opens new avenues for treating not just cancer, but other diseases linked to metabolic abnormalities. The potential for personalized, targeted treatments is significant, marking a shift in how we approach disease management.

Thai officials are battling the invasive blackchin tilapia, an African fish wreaking havoc in local waters. This omnivorous species thrives in both fresh and saltwater, breeding rapidly with eggs hatching in about 20 days at a 99% success rate. By July, it had spread to 16 of Thailand’s 77 provinces, causing significant damage to shrimp farms with losses reaching 300,000 baht per farm in some areas.

The issue has involved Thai conglomerate Charoen Pokphand Group, specifically its subsidiary CP Foods, which imported the fish in 2010 for research. Despite CP Foods’ claims of proper authorization and the subsequent cancellation of the research due to fish deaths, the Department of Fisheries disputes these assertions, noting DNA evidence linking all found tilapia to a single stock.

In response, the government has initiated a comprehensive strategy, including purchasing caught tilapia at a premium and releasing genetically modified, infertile fish into the wild. CP Foods, while denying direct responsibility, pledges cooperation, planning to buy 2 million kilograms of the fish and introduce natural predators to control the population.

This situation underscores the risks of introducing non-native species without thorough consideration of ecological impacts. The swift government and corporate responses reflect a pragmatic approach to mitigate immediate damage, yet the long-term ecological consequences remain uncertain.
