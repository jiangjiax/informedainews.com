Children won a climate lawsuit in South Korea. The court ruled that the government's climate law was insufficient. Now, the government must draft new, improved laws to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Hannah Kim, eight, and Jeah Han, 12, were among the plaintiffs. They argue that climate change impacts their lives, such as typhoons causing school closures. They aspire for the world to improve.

Hyunjung Yoon, 19, is a dedicated climate activist. She emphasizes that the government should safeguard people's rights, not merely meet targets. She views the lawsuit as a pivotal moment.

The children yearn for a safer world. They reject a society where only the strong thrive. They advocate for everyone's well-being.

Jeah simply wishes for the world to remain as it is now.

### Nvidia Faces Antitrust Investigation by U.S. Department of Justice

Nvidia, an AI chipmaker, faces scrutiny from the U.S. Department of Justice. They received a subpoena, a legal demand for evidence. The DOJ suspects Nvidia of antitrust violations, specifically hindering supplier switching and penalizing non-exclusive chip users.

This follows criticism from progressive groups, who argue Nvidia's hardware-software bundling stifles innovation and locks in customers. France's antitrust body also plans to charge Nvidia for similar practices.

Antitrust laws aim to prevent market monopolies, ensuring fair competition.

Eleven people, including Bella Nilsson, once dubbed the “queen of trash,” are on trial in Sweden. They're accused of illegal toxic waste dumping, the country’s largest environmental crime case.

Think Pink, the recycling company at the center, allegedly buried waste in 21 locations, risking human health and the environment. Nilsson and her ex-husband, Thomas, deny the charges.

The trial, expected to last nine months, involves serious environmental and economic crimes. Think Pink’s pink construction bags were ubiquitous in Stockholm from 2018-2020. The company collapsed in 2020 after the arrests.

Police found high levels of arsenic, dioxins, and other toxins. Some dumps caught fire, one lasting months. Prosecutors claim Think Pink used falsified documents to deceive authorities and profit.

Damages are estimated at 260 million SEK (£19 million), mostly from municipalities cleaning up the waste. The case highlights how people often ignore the origins of cheap services.

Nilsson, now named Fariba Vancor, insists the company followed the law and was framed by rivals. Her lawyer supports her claims.

### Solar Storm Impacts Infrastructure: From Power Grids to Satellites

On May 10, a massive solar storm illuminated the sky with the northern lights, visible even in South America. This event, caused by three coronal mass ejections, was one of the most powerful in 500 years.

Behind the spectacle, scientists at NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center were on high alert. An internal memo described the geomagnetic storm as "extreme" and potentially catastrophic if not managed properly.

Solar Cycle 25, ongoing until 2030, has seen unexpected activity, with sunspots triggering powerful solar flares. These flares disrupted high-frequency radio communications, crucial for trans-oceanic aviation.

A day before the event, the Space Weather Prediction Center alerted the North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC), giving 3,000 utility companies six hours to prepare. They also informed FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.

The storm disrupted navigation, power grids, aviation, and satellite operations, highlighting the vulnerability of modern infrastructure to space weather. Despite mitigation efforts, areas for improvement in preparedness and response were noted.

Coronal mass ejection: A massive burst of solar wind and magnetic fields from the Sun's corona.
High-frequency radio: Radio waves used for long-distance communication, essential for aviation.

Taobao is set to fully integrate WeChat Pay, marking a new milestone in the "interconnectivity" of internet giants. This initiative, led by the Taobao-Tian Group, aims to expand into lower-tier markets and enhance transaction conversion rates and user engagement frequency. WeChat Pay is preferred by 83% and 78% of users in counties and townships respectively, significantly higher than the 76% in urban areas.

The integration of WeChat Pay into Taobao is of great significance. Previously, users who did not have Alipay installed would drop off during the payment process. Now, with WeChat Pay, transactions directly redirect to WeChat, streamlining the process. Tests have shown that this effectively attracts users from lower-tier cities. It is expected to add millions of daily active users, primarily from the elderly and younger demographics.

For Tencent, the partnership brings new revenue. Taobao's use of WeChat Pay incurs a "payment institution service fee." Merchants are also actively responding, as they can consolidate payment data to optimize marketing strategies.

Before this collaboration, the two giants had long been in competition, operating in silos. From 2008 to 2021, the platforms drifted further apart. The "3Q War" in 2010 marked the beginning, which was not resolved until 2014. In 2013, WeChat blocked "Laiwang," and Taobao blocked WeChat on mobile. Taobao had multiple attempts to access WeChat's traffic but faced obstacles.

In recent years, the internet environment has drastically changed, and interconnectivity has become a trend. In 2021, Tencent expressed its intention to relax external link controls, albeit gradually. Taobao's access to WeChat's traffic has been a bumpy journey, but it has finally been realized.

The two giants are gradually thawing, moving from a closed to an open approach. The ebb and flow of business is based on corporate development needs and is also a reflection of the zeitgeist.

Scientists venture into the depths, exploring frigid oceans for novel antibiotics. Bacteria, akin to cunning adversaries, evade our medications and develop resistance. Physicians urgently combine various treatments to counterattack.

Researchers in Finland and Norway seek more effective strategies. They aim to disrupt bacteria's evasion tactics rather than merely eradicating them. This approach prevents the evolution of superbugs. They discovered compounds in deep-sea organisms—a scallop and a glass sponge—that interfere with E. coli, a harmful bacterium linked to severe diarrhea in children.

These newly identified actinomycetes, prevalent in soil and responsible for 70% of our antibiotics, may yield new tools in the deep sea.

Future efforts include optimizing production and conducting more detailed studies on these compounds. The goal is to discover new methods to control bacteria without triggering the development of defensive mechanisms.

A new extensive study examined over 15,000 individuals aged between 50 and 90. It revealed that experiencing a concussion in amateur sports does not appear to have long-term detrimental effects on the brain. In fact, it might even offer some benefits.

Researchers from Exeter, Sydney, Oxford, and Harvard investigated how frequently these individuals sustained head injuries, whether through sports or other accidents. Those who suffered concussions in sports performed slightly better on brain tests compared to those who did not.

This does not imply that sustaining a head injury is beneficial. It merely suggests that the positive aspects of participating in sports might counteract the negative effects. However, this finding pertains to amateurs, not professionals, who experience significantly more and severe impacts.

Therefore, while sports like rugby carry risks, the study indicates that they might not be as harmful as previously thought for average individuals. Nonetheless, we must remain cautious regarding children and professionals, whose brain development and resilience differ significantly.

Zheng Qinwen, the rising star of Chinese tennis, is challenging the US Open quarterfinals as an Olympic gold medalist. Her opponent, Sabalenka from Belarus, is a renowned player who has reached the Grand Slam quarterfinals ten times in the past five years, demonstrating remarkable consistency.

Zheng Qinwen has been impressive at this year's US Open, with a powerful serve and nearly twice as many Ace balls as her opponent. Her matches are filled with resilience, often coming back from behind to win. However, facing Sabalenka, Zheng needs to strengthen her second serve, as Sabalenka's return of second serve is highly effective, posing a challenge to Zheng.

Since her loss in last year's US Open final, Sabalenka has improved both tactically and psychologically. She emphasizes enjoying leisure time during important tournaments to maintain mental strength.

Although Zheng Qinwen has lost both previous encounters against Sabalenka, she is full of anticipation, viewing Sabalenka as a mountain she must climb to become a top player. This match is not only a test of skill but also a battle of psychology and willpower.

Part of the merchants in Golmud City, Haixi Prefecture of Qinghai Province, and Jingyuan County, Baiyin City of Gansu Province, have been using sodium metabisulfite and sulfur to process Goji berries to enhance their appearance and price. This practice has drawn public attention, prompting swift responses from the local governments of both regions, which have established investigation teams, with police involvement. Lawyers point out that the implicated parties are suspected of producing and selling toxic and harmful food, and are required to bear punitive damages ten times the amount. Experts warn that long-term consumption of such Goji berries may lead to poisoning.

Sodium metabisulfite, a chemical substance, is commonly used in food processing as a preservative and bleaching agent, but excessive use is harmful to human health. Sulfur fumigation is a traditional method of food processing, but the use of industrial sulfur may introduce harmful substances.

This incident not only violates the criminal law but also breaches the "Regulations on Promoting the Development of Goji Berry Industry in Haixi Mongolian and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture," which explicitly prohibits the use of sodium metabisulfite and its substitutes in Goji berry processing.

The public's concern over food safety has been reignited, calling for severe punishment of the involved parties. Food safety issues cannot be overlooked and require continuous attention and enhanced regulation.
