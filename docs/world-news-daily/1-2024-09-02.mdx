In the past year, over 30 pharmaceutical executives in China have faced investigation for corruption. The crackdown, initiated by the National Health Commission and nine other departments, has targeted both public and private sectors. Key figures from major companies like Guangzhou Pharmaceutical Group, Shanghai Pharmaceuticals, and China National Pharmaceutical Group have been implicated.

The investigations reveal a pattern of misconduct, including bribery and embezzlement, often linked to high sales expenses and improper practices in academic promotions. Notable cases include the former chairman of Guangzhou Pharmaceutical Group, Li Chuyan, and the ex-chairman of Shanghai Pharmaceuticals, Zhou Jun, both accused of serious violations.

Additionally, several healthcare company CEOs have been detained under suspicion of corruption or other illegal activities. These include Zhou Wei, the chairman of Weining Health, and Su Qingcan, the head of Huaxia Eye Hospital Group.

This widespread scrutiny underscores a significant shift in China's approach to corporate governance and ethical standards within the pharmaceutical industry. The focus on top executives suggests a move towards greater accountability and transparency.

Russia and its trade partners are constructing new currencies and payment systems to circumvent the US dollar and Western financial networks. This strategy counters economic sanctions imposed following Russia's actions in Ukraine.

Since 2014, Russia has been advancing its own financial infrastructures, such as the System for Transfer of Financial Messages (SPFS), a substitute for SWIFT, which is globally utilized for financial transactions. SPFS currently supports 556 organizations across 20 countries.

Russia has also connected its Mir payment system with Iran's Shetab, and is integrating with China's Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) and India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI). These systems handle millions of transactions, challenging SWIFT's supremacy.

Moreover, Russia is exploring the use of central bank currencies and cryptocurrencies, and is considering the revival of barter trade, a direct exchange of goods without currency, reminiscent of the Soviet-era Comecon.

This transition jeopardizes the US dollar's global reserve status and diminishes Western financial hegemony.

Pope Francis sets off on a 12-day Asia-Pacific tour, visiting Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, East Timor, and Singapore. This journey, originally planned for 2020 but delayed due to the pandemic, underscores Asia's strategic importance for the Catholic Church.

The tour, spanning over 20,000 miles, includes over 40 events. Francis's first stop is Indonesia, where he will visit Jakarta's main mosque and tour the "Tunnel of Friendship," a symbol of religious harmony linking the mosque to the Catholic cathedral. He will also meet with Indonesia's president and hold a mass for 80,000 people.

In Papua New Guinea, Francis will address climate change, highlighting rising sea levels and severe weather events. His visit to East Timor will include a mass at the seaside esplanade where Pope John Paul II once celebrated. This stop may force Francis to confront the clergy sexual abuse scandal involving Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo.

The final stop is Singapore, part of the Vatican's efforts to improve ties with China. The recent recognition of Tianjin bishop Melchior Shi Hongzhen by China is seen as a positive step in this direction.

This tour, despite health challenges, showcases Francis's commitment to environmental issues, interfaith dialogue, and the growth of the Catholic Church in Asia.

Shanghai has released the country's first standard specification for outdoor smoking areas, set to take effect on September 1, 2024. Led by the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission and drafted jointly by multiple institutions, the standard aims to regulate the setup and management of outdoor smoking areas to reduce the harm of secondhand smoke on public health.

The standard outlines requirements for the location, facilities, and signage of outdoor smoking areas, and specifies daily management responsibilities. Shanghai plans to establish 300 demonstration sites by the end of the year, covering commercial districts, sports venues, parks, and other public spaces.

This move not only fills a domestic gap but also has innovative significance internationally. By setting up outdoor smoking areas, smokers are guided to avoid crowds, reducing the phenomenon of "wandering smoke" and protecting non-smokers from secondhand smoke.

Additionally, smoking areas will provide information on quitting services to help smokers quit. The Shanghai Municipal Health Commission stated that the standard offers professional guidance for the reasonable setup and management of outdoor smoking areas,有助于 enhance the city's refined management of smoking control, and promote the construction of a healthy city.

### Changan Automobile invests in solid-state battery technology, leading the revolution in new energy vehicles.

Changan Automobile, a major Chinese carmaker, has recently made a significant investment in Tai-Blue New Energy, a startup focused on the development of solid-state batteries. Solid-state batteries replace the liquid electrolytes in traditional lithium batteries with solid electrolytes, enhancing energy density and safety stability, and are expected to enable electric vehicles to achieve a range of over 1000 kilometers.

Tai-Blue New Energy, though low-profile, has already secured multiple rounds of funding from investors including Country Garden Venture Capital and CICC Capital. Its core technologies include self-developed lithium-oxygen polymer composite materials and interfacial softening techniques, which address issues of high internal resistance and poor interfacial contact in solid-state batteries.

Changan's move not only provides financial support to Tai-Blue but also signals the accelerated application of solid-state battery technology in the automotive industry. Tai-Blue plans to achieve mass production of all-solid-state batteries by 2026, with current semi-solid-state batteries nearing the cost of liquid batteries.

The revolutionary potential of solid-state batteries is akin to the disruption brought by the advent of smartphones, potentially reshaping the product forms and market landscape of new energy vehicles. Changan's investment is a proactive move in anticipating future technological trends and a bid for defining industry standards.

Chongqing, as a major hub for the automotive industry in western China, stands to benefit greatly. The successful transformation of Changan, coupled with the rise of Tai-Blue New Energy, positions Chongqing prominently in the landscape of China's automotive industry ascendancy.

Cloning monkey technology has put China in the lead. The team led by researcher Sun Qiang has made a breakthrough, giving birth to the world's first pair of somatic cell cloned monkeys, "Zhong Zhong" and "Hua Hua." This achievement is of great significance.

Cloning, or asexual reproduction, bypasses sexual reproduction and avoids genetic variation. Traditional monkey research involves various genotypes, which affects the accuracy of experiments. Cloned monkeys, with identical genes, become the ideal model animals.

Sun Qiang explained that cloned monkeys are like a uniform exam paper, ensuring fairness in drug testing. For example, a group of monkeys with a mutation in gene A, having the same background, allows the drug's effects to be clearly seen.

Cloning technology has a long history. Asexual reproduction in plants and nuclear transfer in animals both fall into this category. Somatic cell cloning, theoretically unlimited, is superior to embryo splitting.

The purpose of cloned monkeys is not for novelty or to clone humans, but to build disease models and promote drug development. The Center for Excellence in Brain Science and Intelligence Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences continues to explore, with a broad future ahead.

Black Myth: Wukong, a Chinese video game, sold over 10 million units in just three days, marking a first for China and a significant step in the global gaming market. Dino Ying, chairman of Hero Games, an early investor, anticipates more top-tier games on the horizon.

Ying was aware of another AAA game in development but kept the details confidential. He hinted that sales for Black Myth: Wukong exceeded initial projections, though not by double. Future games will launch with a global focus.

China's gaming market is vast, with 600 million gamers. Historically, AAA games, known for high-quality graphics and marketing, were rare from Chinese developers due to the long production times and costs, which favored mobile games.

Hero Games invested heavily in Game Science, the developer of Black Myth: Wukong. Despite earlier failures, Ying saw potential and described the game as the best he'd ever seen.

Tencent purchased a 5% stake, promising no interference. China's government, after tightening controls on gaming, approved Black Myth: Wukong without changes. Ying felt regulations were now more supportive.

Domestic game sales in China reached 147.27 billion yuan in the first half of the year. However, console games made up just 0.5% of that. Ying noted a surge in PlayStation and graphics card sales post-launch, similar to the Nintendo Switch's popularity with Zelda.

Chinese games, rich in cultural elements, are gaining global appeal. Ying believes ancient Chinese stories, enduring for millennia, are ripe for gaming.

New research by Dutch and British scientists shows that gaps in the fossil record do not cripple our understanding of evolution. Fossils are crucial, but not every creature becomes one. Many are lost to erosion before discovery.

Niklas Hohmann at Utrecht University led the study. They found that regular gaps, not just incompleteness, shape how we piece together evolutionary history. Think of a movie: missing every frame still lets you follow the plot.

This eases concerns since Darwin's time. He worried that missing fossils would obscure gradual changes his theory predicted. Now, knowing where and why gaps occur helps us reconstruct ancient evolution with new precision.

The team used computer simulations to test how well we can recover evolutionary patterns from incomplete fossil data. Results show that despite gaps, fossil evidence supports our grasp of evolutionary patterns and rates.

CCTV has exposed the issue of excessive sulfur in goji berries, with reporters delving into the processing sites and being overwhelmed to the point of tears.

Goji berries, representative of the concept of food as medicine, are widely used in foods, beverages, and health supplements. These seemingly plump and bright red berries, however, conceal food safety risks. Merchants in Golmud, Qinghai, and Jingyuan, Gansu, have been illegally using sodium metabisulfite and industrial sulfur to enhance color and appearance, allowing even inferior goji berries to fetch good prices.

Sodium metabisulfite, a chemical agent used to enhance color in goji berry processing, is explicitly prohibited by regulations. Industrial sulfur, which contains a high amount of arsenic and is harmful to human health, is not allowed in food processing. Reporters found that merchants were knowingly violating the law for profit.

The goji berry industry, originally a local specialty aimed at increasing farmers' income, has been tarnished by illegal processing, resulting in a loss of industry credibility and ultimately not worth the cost. Addressing the industry's痛点 is the pressing matter at hand.
