# World News Daily(2024-08-09) : Ukraine Admits to Kursk Incursion, Citing Russian Aggression

## Ukraine Admits to Kursk Incursion, Citing Russian Aggression

In its first official admission, Ukraine justified its incursion into Russia's Kursk region. Mykhailo Podolyak, a top aide to President Zelenskiy, cited Russia's "unequivocal aggression" as the root cause. He added, "War is war, with its own rules, where the aggressor inevitably reaps corresponding outcomes."

Fighting escalated near Korenevo and Sudzha, with Ukrainian forces reportedly in control of parts of Sudzha. Russia declared a state of emergency in Kursk, evacuating 3,000 civilians.

Russian military bloggers, often the most reliable sources, detailed the conflict. Ukraine's advance, using infantry, armor, drones, and electronic warfare, surprised Moscow. President Putin, visibly angry, convened his security council.

Experts remain divided on the strategic value of the incursion. Jade McGlynn, a Ukraine expert, noted its success as a political strategy, undermining claims of Russia's invincibility.

The US, unaware of Ukraine's plans, reiterated its policy restricting high-value weapon use within Russia's borders. The main gas pipeline to Europe runs near Sudzha, but Ukraine has allowed gas flow to continue, adhering to a contract expiring in 2024.

  alt="China Uses Public Debt to Acquire Unused Land for Affordable Housing"
/>

The Chinese government plans to purchase unused land from struggling developers using regional bonds with the aim of constructing affordable housing. Special-purpose bonds, introduced in 2015, are used to fund infrastructure and now also land acquisitions.

Sales of new homes declined by 22% in the first half of 2024. Many developers are cash-strapped and unable to initiate new projects. The government's objective is to assist these developers and optimize the use of land.

In May, a lending program was announced to purchase unsold homes, but the progress has been slow. The new plan could put pressure on local government finances if the affordable housing does not generate sufficient revenue.

Special-purpose bonds also support troubled banks. Their balance has tripled since 2019 to 26.1 trillion yuan. Land sales, a significant source of income for local governments, have decreased by 33% from their 2021 peak.

Naoki Tsukioka of Mizuho Research & Technologies observes that the central government is transferring responsibility to local governments. Without substantial fiscal stimulus from the central government, the real estate sector may continue to face challenges.

### Great Barrier Reef Faces Existential Threat Due to Rising Ocean Temperatures

Ocean temperatures at the Great Barrier Reef have reached 400-year highs. Scientists attribute this to greenhouse gases emitted by fossil fuels. The reef is under an "existential threat." Swift reductions in emissions are essential. Without them, the reef's destruction is imminent. The World Heritage committee postponed labeling the reef "in danger" until 2026.

### Security Researcher Exposes USPS Smishing Scam

Grant Smith, a security researcher, uncovered a smishing scam masquerading as USPS. Scammers deceived victims into divulging credit card details through counterfeit websites. Smith infiltrated the scammers' systems, collected evidence, and collaborated with USPS and a major US bank to safeguard 438,669 unique credit cards.

Smishing is a type of phishing that employs text messages to mislead.

The scam encompassed 1,133 domains, capturing over 50,000 email addresses and 1.2 million data points. Victims were spread across the U.S., with California being the most severely affected. The scam likely extends beyond what Smith discovered, potentially connected to similar frauds in various countries.

Austrian police arrested a 19-year-old suspect and two others for planning an Islamist attack at a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna. Chemicals and technical devices found in the suspect's home indicated bomb-making intentions. The plot led to the cancellation of Swift's three-night run at Ernst Happel stadium, affecting over 170,000 fans.

The suspect had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State and stolen chemicals from his former employer. Reports suggest he planned to use a car, machetes, and knives in the attack. Austrian authorities, with help from foreign intelligence, thwarted the plot, though an abstract danger remains.

Taylor Swift has yet to comment. Fans will receive refunds, and there are no plans to reschedule the Vienna shows. Swift's tour continues, with upcoming dates in London's Wembley stadium. UK authorities are monitoring the situation.

### Flint Capital Raises $160M with Innovative Fundraising Strategy

Flint Capital, based in Boston, has raised $160 million. This marks their third fund, which is quadruple the size of their 2013 debut. They concentrate on early and late-stage technology, cybersecurity, fintech, and digital health startups.

Dmitry Smirnov, one of the founders, took an unconventional route. Rather than seeking traditional investors such as pension funds, he focused on IT entrepreneurs. Smirnov was convinced that these tech leaders would be eager to invest in the next wave of innovation.

Flint also casts a global net, particularly in Europe and Israel, but remains committed to the potential of the U.S. market. They have backed successful companies like Socure, WalkMe, and Flo, all of which have reached billion-dollar valuations.

Andrew Gershfeld observed that some investors were former founders backed by Flint. This reinvestment was a testament to Flint's successful strategy.

Despite a challenging fundraising environment, Flint was able to secure the necessary funds. Over the past year, they have supported Israeli startups during the Gaza conflict. Gribov witnessed these companies flourish, reinforcing Flint's global approach.

### OpenAI's AI Threat to Google: Greater Than Regulatory Challenges

  alt="OpenAI's AI Threat to Google: Greater Than Regulatory Challenges"
/>

Google faces a dual threat: antitrust rulings and OpenAI's AI advancements. The U.S. ruling against Google's search monopoly signals a regulatory win, but insiders see AI as the real game-changer. OpenAI's ChatGPT and similar tools are eroding Google's dominance, shifting how search operates.

Google, with its vast search market share and revenue, has long been synonymous with search. Even Apple, despite its self-reliant approach, pays Google to be its default search engine. Yet, Apple's recent partnership with OpenAI hints at a future less dependent on Google.

OpenAI, backed by Microsoft, plans to launch SearchGPT, an AI-driven search engine. This move could accelerate the shift from traditional to AI-powered search, potentially undermining Google's position faster than legal actions.

Google's initial AI efforts, like the AI overview feature, stumbled due to hasty implementation and errors. This raises concerns about Google's ability to compete effectively in AI against nimbler rivals like OpenAI.

Analysts and former Google executives agree that while Google has the resources to lead in AI, its current strategy appears fragmented. The rapid rise of generative AI has caught Google off guard, despite its foundational research in the field.

The article concludes that while antitrust rulings might not immediately impact Google, they could open the search market to more competitors. However, ending Google's search supremacy remains a daunting challenge. The future of search hinges on whether AI innovations can truly disrupt Google's entrenched position.

### Anduril Raises $1.5B, Valuing at $14B and Challenging Top Defense Contractors

Anduril, a defense tech startup, just raised $1.5 billion, valuing it at $14 billion. This positions it to challenge the top five American defense contractors: Lockheed Martin, RTX, Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and General Dynamics. These industry leaders dominate defense contracts, generating billions in revenue.

Founded by Palmer Luckey, Anduril aims to surpass these established firms with a Silicon Valley approach. It recently outperformed Lockheed, Northrop, and Boeing in a drone competition. The company asserts it can operate more swiftly, utilizing software to optimize production.

The latest funding round, co-led by Founders Fund and Sands Capital, represents a substantial increase from Anduril's previous $8.5 billion valuation. The company doubled its revenue to $500 million last year, achieving a high revenue multiple of 28 times. This starkly contrasts with traditional defense companies, such as Lockheed Martin's 1.9 times and Boeing's 1.3 times.

Anduril intends to use the funds to enhance its manufacturing capabilities through a new platform called "Arsenal." This initiative aims to produce tens of thousands of autonomous military systems annually, creating over 1,500 jobs. The objective is to massively scale defense production, prioritizing volume over high-cost, specialized systems.

Anduril's success has reignited interest in defense tech, a sector once considered sluggish and unappealing for investment. Whether Anduril's momentum will benefit the broader industry remains to be seen.

### TikTok Partners with Warner Bros. for Media Discovery

TikTok's new feature, "Spotlight," partners with Warner Bros. and other studios to streamline the process of discovering movies and TV shows. Users can click on videos, access detailed information pages, and choose to stream, rent, or purchase tickets.

Content creators benefit from rewards such as profile frames, filters, and complimentary tickets. Warner Bros. is promoting "House of the Dragon" season two through this initiative. They previously tested the feature with "Dune: Part Two," resulting in 260,000 posts.

Spotlight launches with select studios, potentially positioning TikTok as the premier destination for media discovery, possibly even surpassing Google. TikTok has previously ventured into this space by partnering with Ticketmaster for event ticketing.

This strategy could revolutionize how we seek out entertainment, posing a direct challenge to Google's dominance in search. With AI-driven search tools gaining prominence, TikTok's approach is well-timed.

### Disney's Box Office Success with Three Billion-Dollar Films

Disney's box office is roaring back in 2024. "Inside Out 2" leads the charge, now the top-grossing animated film ever, surpassing $1.5 billion globally. "Deadpool & Wolverine," an R-rated Marvel flick, smashed opening weekend records and is on track to hit $1 billion.

"Moana 2" is next, expected to capitalize on the original's streaming success and hit theaters over Thanksgiving. "Mufasa: The Lion King," a prequel to the 2019 blockbuster, is a December wildcard.

Disney's strategy extends beyond films. Hits like these bolster theme parks, merchandise, and TV shows. The company's recent struggles, including a dip in theme park revenue and criticism over content quality, are being addressed.

CEO Bob Iger attributes the turnaround to a focus on quality over quantity and a renewed emphasis on the theatrical experience. Disney's resilience is evident; it has produced more billion-dollar hits than any other studio.

### How Trump Turned TikTok into a Campaign Weapon

  alt="How Trump Turned TikTok into a Campaign Weapon"

Trump once sought to ban TikTok, but now it has become a campaign weapon. In just two months, he has amassed nearly ten million followers, far surpassing his rivals. His team views it as a secret weapon to attract young voters, aiming to portray Trump as the "number one celebrity entertainer on Earth."

TikTok strategy: Avoid deep policy discussions, focus on behind-the-scenes footage, and showcase a human side. The videos are short and punchy, designed to amplify spontaneous humor and charisma. The team analyzes data, tracks viral moments, and hires TikTok experts to optimize content.

Trump's TikTok account has garnered over 500 million views. His campaign team calls it "the most successful entry in political history," emphasizing Trump's authenticity and charm.

Despite continued Republican attacks on TikTok, Trump's inner circle encourages its use. The number of pro-Trump posts on TikTok is twice that of Biden's. Although the Biden team is working hard, they lag far behind in followers and engagement.

Trump's first TikTok video received nearly 170 million views. Subsequent videos may not have replicated the explosive viewership but remain popular. The team disseminates videos via email, highlighting their popularity.

After Harris joined TikTok, her engagement soared, challenging Trump's dominance. Trump's team strives to maintain their advantage, but Harris's team seems to have gained the upper hand.

Trump leverages the influence of sports and internet celebrities to mobilize young male voters. Collaborations with golf player DeChambeau and video game streamer Ninja have garnered high attention.

Trump explicitly states that saving TikTok is an electoral strategy, urging TikTok users to vote for him. A live video reached 27 million views, with commenters expressing their admiration.

TikTok has become the nerve center of American political debates, with the boundaries between political leaders and influencers blurring. In the social media landscape,争夺关注度与相关性至关重要.
