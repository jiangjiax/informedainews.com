Anura Kumara Dissanayake, a leftist outsider, won Sri Lanka's presidential election, marking a seismic shift in the nation's political landscape. Dissanayake, 55, led the National People’s Power (NPP) alliance, which has never held power. His victory reflects public anger over corruption and economic hardship, sparked by a 2022 crisis.

Dissanayake pledged to renegotiate IMF bailout terms to ease the burden on impoverished Sri Lankans. His win contrasts sharply with previous poor showings; in 2019, he garnered just 3% of the vote.

The election saw a second-round runoff, a first in Sri Lanka's history. Dissanayake secured 42.31% in the first round, leading to a final count against Sajith Premadasa, the parliamentary opposition leader.

The campaign was notably peaceful, a departure from past violence. Dissanayake's success stems from the NPP's long-term strategy to tap into antiestablishment sentiment. Analysts credit his win to grassroots organizing and a novel political blueprint.

Dissanayake's victory underscores a broader trend of antiestablishment forces gaining traction globally. His rise from humble beginnings to the presidency symbolizes a profound shift in Sri Lankan's political dynamics.

  alt="Europe's Largest Economies Face Economic and Political Crises"

Europe's economic landscape is grim. Germany and France, its largest economies, are mired in political and economic crises. September's Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI)—a key economic indicator—shows significant declines in both countries. Germany's PMI fell to 47.2, its lowest in seven months, while France's dropped to 47.4, an eight-month low. A PMI below 50 signals contraction.

Germany, once Europe's growth engine, is now dubbed the "sick man" of the continent. Challenges include Chinese competition, energy prices, and an aging population. The three-way coalition government seems unable to address these issues, further eroding confidence.

France faces its own troubles. A new minority government, led by Michel Barnier, must navigate fiscal challenges and political instability. Barnier's immediate tasks include drafting a 2025 budget and presenting a deficit reduction plan to the European Commission. The far-right National Rally party poses a constant threat, complicating governance.

Both economies are in dire straits. Capital Economics predicts Germany's recession will deepen, while France's growth prospects are bleak. The European Commission forecasts minimal growth for both countries in 2024.

In summary, Europe's economic giants are struggling. Political upheaval and economic uncertainty have pushed them to the brink. The road to recovery is long and uncertain.

### 2024 U.S. Presidential Election: A Close Contest

  alt="2024 U.S. Presidential Election: A Close Contest"
/>

CNN analysis suggests that the 2024 U.S. presidential election is shaping up to be "the closest race of the century." The competition between Democratic candidate Harris and Republican candidate Trump is exceptionally fierce, with polls showing Harris only slightly ahead, often within the margin of error.

The Electoral College system makes the outcome uncertain. Harris's support has slightly increased after the televised debates, but she is not yet assured of victory. The latest polls show Harris leading Trump by three to five percentage points, far from a level that would guarantee a win.

Since the campaign began, the two candidates have maintained a deadlock, with no candidate ever leading in national polls by at least five percentage points. This situation is quite rare and similar election dynamics may have to be traced back to the 1960s.

The final result will depend on who can secure at least 270 electoral votes. Analysis estimates that Harris needs to win the popular vote by at least three percentage points to have a clear advantage in electoral votes, but she has not yet reached that point.

Currently, Harris is confident of securing 225 electoral votes, while Trump is confident of securing 219. The electoral votes from seven swing states and Nebraska's 2nd congressional district are still up for grabs.

Early in-person voting has already begun in some states, with more states set to follow in mid-October. This closely contested presidential race still holds many uncertainties.

In 1951, six-year-old Luis Armando Albino was abducted from a California park. He remained missing for 73 years. Thanks to an online ancestry test, old photos, and newspaper clippings, his niece, Alida Alequin, located him on the U.S. East Coast.

Albino, now a retired firefighter and Marine Corps veteran, was raised by a couple who treated him as their own. His mother never gave up hope, passing away in 2005.

Alequin's DNA test in 2020 showed a 22% match with her uncle. After further investigation, she and her daughters found him in June. Albino met his California family, including his brother Roger, who died in August.

Oakland police acknowledged Alequin's efforts, calling the outcome "what we strive for." Albino prefers privacy but Alequin hopes her story helps other families.

**Key Terms:**
- **Ancestry test:** A DNA test used to trace one's genetic lineage.
- **Microfilm:** A photographic film used to store large amounts of printed or photographed material for easy viewing.

### GM Electric Vehicles Gain Access to Tesla Superchargers

General Motors (GM) electric vehicles can now use Tesla's Superchargers, thanks to a new adapter. This move expands the North American Charging Standard (NACS) compatibility, easing concerns about charging options for GM customers. The adapter, priced at $225, grants access to roughly 17,800 Tesla Superchargers, boosting GM's total fast-charger network to 231,800 across the U.S.

GM is also part of IONNA, a group planning to build 30,000 high-powered chargers nationwide. This partnership marks a significant shift, as GM and Tesla were once fierce rivals, particularly over Tesla's direct sales model. Now, cooperation benefits drivers, offering reliable, fast, and convenient charging.

Tesla Superchargers are considered the industry gold standard—fast, reliable, and well-located with amenities like restrooms and fresh food. This could shift the electric vehicle (EV) market, potentially reducing demand for plug-in hybrids as GM, Ford, and Stellantis introduce their models.

A GM executive emphasizes the company's commitment to an all-electric future, highlighting ongoing efforts to expand public charging infrastructure. This move not only addresses range anxiety but also positions GM as a leader in the evolving EV landscape.

  alt="U.S. Homelessness Crisis: Record Numbers Expected in 2023"
/>

The U.S. is set to break its homelessness record this year. Preliminary data from over 250 service organizations shows a 10% rise, with around 550,000 people homeless on a single night. This could surpass the 2023 peak of 653,000.

Cities like Boston, San Francisco, and Chicago report significant increases. Chicago saw a 70% migrant homeless population. Texas's migrant busing to cities like Chicago and New York contributed to these numbers.

Home prices have surged 2.4 times faster than inflation since the 1960s. The average U.S. home now costs over $430,000, compared to $177,000 if prices had kept pace with inflation.

The COVID-19 pandemic shifted lifestyles, exacerbating the housing crisis. Ending pandemic aid worsened the situation. Mental health issues and drug use, like fentanyl, also play a role.

In short, soaring housing costs, pandemic shifts, and social issues are driving the homelessness surge. The U.S. faces a stark housing crisis, with no easy solutions in sight.

### California's Economic Growth and Reduced Greenhouse Gas Emissions

California's economy expanded by 78% from 2000 to 2022, yet greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 20%. In 2022 alone, emissions fell by 2.4%, or 9.3 million metric tons—equivalent to the emissions of 2.2 million gas-powered cars. The most significant reduction came from the transportation sector, thanks to the increased use of electric cars and renewable fuels.

Emissions from the electricity sector also declined by 4.1%, even as electricity usage increased. Solar and wind power now make up 30% of electricity generation. Battery storage capacity surged by 757% from 2019 to 2023, enough to power 6.6 million homes for four hours.

Industrial emissions reached a 22-year low, dropping by 2%. Livestock emissions, which account for 70% of agriculture's greenhouse gas output, peaked in 2012 and decreased in 2022 due to the use of methane digesters. Methane emissions from landfills also declined, thanks to waste reduction efforts.

Governor Gavin Newsom attributes the progress to California's climate programs. The state aims to continue this trend, with zero-emission vehicles expected to make up a quarter of new car sales in the second quarter of 2024.

**Key Terms:**
- **Methane Digesters:** Systems that capture methane from livestock waste and convert it into clean fuel.
- **Cap-and-Trade Program:** A market-based approach to controlling pollution by providing economic incentives for achieving reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
- **Renewables Portfolio Standard:** A policy that requires utility companies to obtain a minimum percentage of their power from renewable energy sources.

/>

CCTV Investigation Reveals the Truth and Risks of "Zero Down Payment" and "Ultra-Low Down Payment" Home Purchases. Recently, many developers and intermediaries have introduced such promotions to attract homebuyers. However, these practices are actually illegal, circumventing down payment policies through methods such as inflating house prices and fronting loans.

Cities like Zhengzhou and Nanning have issued risk warnings, pointing out that "zero down payment" schemes hide significant financial risks that could harm consumer rights. For instance, a salesperson for a certain property promised a down payment of 20,000 yuan, but in reality, this was achieved through dual contracts and inflated house prices, increasing the bank loan amount.

After opting for "zero down payment," the monthly mortgage and interest payments for homebuyers significantly increase. Taking a 970,000 yuan house as an example, the monthly mortgage after a normal down payment is 3,865.32 yuan, while with "zero down payment," it rises to 4,547 yuan, an increase of 17.6%. The total interest also increases from 477,471 yuan to 561,731 yuan, an additional 84,000 yuan.

Moreover, inflating house prices can lead to additional taxes. Experts point out that "zero down payment" does not reduce the burden; the total amount paid remains the same, or even more.

Such practices are fraught with risks, easily leading homebuyers to misjudge their capabilities and increasing the risk of default. Banks also face challenges in their audits, needing to be vigilant against such illegal activities.

**Key Term Explanations:**
- **Dual Contracts**: Two contracts with different content for the same transaction, one for the actual transaction and the other for evading regulations or avoiding taxes.
- **LPR Rate**: Loan Prime Rate, the interest rate banks offer to their most creditworthy customers.

### Tech giants enter the hearing aid market, driving industry transformation.

Apple, iFlytek, Tencent, and other tech giants have recently announced their entry into the hearing aid market, signaling a transformation in this long-dominated industry.

For a long time, the hearing aid market has been controlled by six major groups (Signia, Phonak, ReSound, Oticon, Widex, and Starkey), which together hold over 95% of the global market share. These groups have maintained high gross margins of 55%-75% through high prices and bundling strategies.

However, the involvement of tech giants is changing this landscape. Apple's AirPods Pro has received FDA approval as an OTC hearing aid; iFlytek has partnered with Bo'in Hearing to launch an O2O fitting solution; Tencent has released a one-stop hearing aid solution that improves clarity and intelligibility by 85%.

These innovations not only lower the price of hearing aids but also simplify the purchasing process. For example, OTC hearing aids in the U.S. now range from $99 to $3,000, far below the previous average price of $4,700.

In China, the entry of tech giants has also driven market education and technological advancement. Zhitin Technology, backed by Xiaomi, has sold over 5.21 million hearing aids on the Xiaomi Youpin platform; iFlytek has become the top-selling brand in the hearing aid category on both JD.com and Tmall.

Although online channels simplify the purchasing process, the unique nature of hearing aids (requiring personalized tuning and usage guidance) still necessitates offline support. Therefore, most companies opt for a dual "online + offline" channel strategy.

Overall, the involvement of tech giants is breaking the monopoly in the hearing aid market, driving the industry towards greater accessibility and convenience.

Sentinel-2C, launched just two weeks ago, has already transmitted its first images. These images showcase a vast area from Seville, Spain, through the Camargue region in France to Barcelona, Spain, as well as details of wildfires in California and the Great Blue Hole in Belize. The satellite is equipped with a multi-spectral imager that captures high-resolution images from an altitude of 786 kilometers, covering a swath of 290 kilometers.

The quality of the first images has exceeded expectations, demonstrating the satellite's exceptional performance. Simona Ceccarelli, Head of the Earth Observation Program at ESA, stated that these images strongly affirm the success of the mission. Sentinel-2C will serve the Copernicus program for the coming years.

Following its launch, the satellite entered a commissioning phase, during which the multi-spectral imager will undergo calibration over the next three months. Sentinel-2C will operate alongside Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, Sentinel-3, and Sentinel-5P.

Copernicus Sentinel-2 data is widely applied in various fields, including agriculture, water quality monitoring, and natural disaster management. The data is freely accessible through the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem.

The Sentinel-2 mission is part of the Copernicus program, which is the Earth observation component of the EU's space program.

The Pokemon Company aims to strengthen its presence in Indonesia, a country with 60 million young people and a growing economy. Despite having been present for 20 years, its popularity still trails behind that in Japan and the U.S.

Mana Wakiyama, a representative from The Pokemon Company, highlighted this gap during the finale of Pikachu’s Indonesia Journey in Jakarta. The tour, which also included stops in Surabaya, Yogyakarta, and Bali, attracted 30,000 fans. Pikachu was dressed in batik, a nod to local culture.

The company plans to further localize its products, beginning with the mobile game Pokemon Go and trading cards. The Bali event alone generated $13.6 million, including $1.4 million in taxes.

Indonesian fans are enthusiastic about these efforts. Fauzan Ilhami, a 21-year-old college student, hopes for more localized merchandise and a Pokemon Center in Indonesia, which would reduce the need to travel abroad for official products.

The Pokemon franchise started as a 1996 computer game, expanding into cartoons and merchandise. It is now one of Japan’s top intellectual properties, initially gaining popularity in Indonesia through cartoons.

  alt="Tsinghua team develops new oral nanomedicine for treating ulcerative colitis."
/>

A research team from Tsinghua University has developed an oral nanomedicine that can precisely target the site of ulcerative colitis (UC), rapidly suppress inflammation, and repair the intestinal barrier. The drug utilizes nanoparticles encapsulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers and targeting molecules, fabricated through a layer-by-layer self-assembly technique. Studies have found that low molecular weight heparin can specifically target integrins on the surface of inflammatory cells, while ROS-sensitive bonds effectively clear ROS from the microenvironment, achieving dual therapeutic effects.

This "two birds with one stone" design not only enhances treatment efficacy but also reduces side effects. The research team also designed a probiotic delivery system, using biomacromolecular materials to enhance the stability of probiotics in the gastrointestinal tract and achieving efficient release in the colon through pH-responsive groups.

In the future, combining AI technology, the team plans to develop more precise drug design and optimize the delivery system, potentially offering more effective treatment options for patients with ulcerative colitis.

**Explanation:**
- **Ulcerative colitis (UC):** A chronic inflammatory bowel disease.
- **Reactive oxygen species (ROS):** Harmful substances produced during cellular metabolism.
- **Integrin:** A protein on the cell surface involved in cell adhesion and signal transduction.
- **Probiotics:** Beneficial microorganisms for the human body.

  alt="Rising Type 2 Diabetes Cases in the U.S.: A Decade-Long Trend"
/>

From 2012 to 2022, the number of Americans with Type 2 diabetes surged nearly 20%. Southern and Midwestern states saw the sharpest rises. Non-Hispanic Blacks and low-income groups bore the brunt. Obesity and inactivity were primary culprits.

Age, race, income, weight, and exercise all heighten diabetes risk. Georgia University found a 20% increase in Type 2 cases over the decade. Blacks were hit hardest, with 16% diagnosed. Over-65s had a 1-in-5 chance. Low-income and less-educated groups faced higher risks.

Diabetes costs the U.S. $412 billion annually. Researcher Sulakshan Neupane warns of rising future costs. Data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, covering 400,000 people, underpins these findings.

Regional disparities exist. Arkansas, Kentucky, and Nebraska saw the steepest rises. Ten states recorded increases of 25% or more. Neupane urges policymakers to focus on these hotspots.

Obesity and inactivity boost diabetes risk. One in five obese people had diabetes in 2022. Exercise cuts risk. Neupane advises healthy eating, active living, and weight loss to mitigate risk.

A research team from Pohang University of Science and Technology has successfully replicated biological wrinkle structures in vitro, revealing that compression force and dehydration are key factors in wrinkle formation. The study, published in Nature Communications, not only contributes to research on skin aging but also has broad applications in biomedicine and the cosmetics industry.

The research, led by Professor Dong Sung Kim, Professor Anna Lee, and Dr. Jaeseung Youn, developed an epithelial tissue model composed of human epithelial cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM). By combining this model with a precise compression force device, the team was able to reproduce wrinkle structures found in tissues such as the intestines and skin in vitro.

The study found that compression force leads to mechanical instability in the ECM layer, resulting in wrinkles, and that dehydration of the ECM layer is also a critical factor. This finding aligns with the phenomenon of wrinkle formation due to dehydration in the underlying tissues of aging skin.

Professor Kim noted that the platform, which does not require animal testing, allows for real-time imaging and observation of the wrinkle formation process, making it widely applicable in fields such as embryology, biomedical engineering, and cosmetics.

TOKYO — The Deaflympics, set to debut in Tokyo in 2025, marks a historic first for Japan. This event, distinct from the Paralympics, brings together deaf athletes from around the world. The games, spanning 12 days, will feature 3,000 athletes competing in 21 sports.

The Deaflympics foster international exchange, transcending differences in sign languages. International Sign Language (ISL) serves as a common tongue, much like English in spoken communication. However, regional sign languages, such as Japanese Sign Language (JSL) and American Sign Language (ASL), vary significantly.

Clubs like Tampopo in Tokyo are preparing for the event by teaching ISL. Members, including those who can hear, are eager to connect with international participants. The diversity in sign languages highlights the unique challenges and opportunities in deaf communication.

Digital technology is also bridging gaps. Smartphones and IT infrastructure are making global communication easier for deaf individuals. The Deaflympics in Tokyo could be a catalyst for greater international understanding and connection among deaf communities.

Craft and sparkling sake are revitalizing Japan's traditional rice wine culture. Sendai Station Brewery Fermenteria offers Sake Baby, a fizzy, yogurt-like drink with 5% alcohol, appealing to younger tastes. Shokagura, the brewer, plans to expand its sales to more restaurants.

Ichinokura's Suzune, a pioneering sparkling sake, has gained international acclaim, including a premium version, Suzune Wabi. Takara Shuzo's Mio, Japan's top-selling sparkling sake, attracts younger consumers, especially women.

Despite overall sake shipment declines, craft sake, which uses traditional techniques with varied ingredients, thrives without export-only restrictions. Kakuyasu Group promotes sake-and-soda cocktails, replacing beer as a first-course drink in restaurants. This innovation has boosted sake sales by 10% year-on-year.

**Insights:**
The evolution of sake reflects changing consumer preferences and global interest. Craft and sparkling varieties offer a modern twist, making traditional sake more accessible and appealing to younger generations and international markets. This shift underscores the adaptability of traditional industries in the face of modern tastes and global trends.

Over the past decade, the Chinese dining table has undergone significant changes. Data shows that Chinese people can consume 700 million pigs, 800 million chickens in Guangdong, and at least 300 million crayfish in Shanghai in a year. These figures reflect the richness and diversity of Chinese culinary culture.

Carbohydrates play a crucial role in the Chinese diet. In 2022, the per capita grain intake in Hebei, Tibet, and Jiangxi was 181.4, 176.8, and 160.9 kilograms, respectively. Taking Hebei as an example, this is equivalent to eating more than three bowls of noodles per person per day.

In terms of meat consumption, Chongqing, Sichuan, and Guangdong are the provinces that consume the most pork, while Xinjiang, Tibet, and Inner Mongolia prefer beef and mutton. In 2022, the per capita meat consumption in China was 70.57 kilograms per year.

Economic development has driven an increase in food supply. In 2022, the per capita grain supply in China increased by 104 kilocalories, equivalent to a bowl of rice. However, the proportion of grain on the dining table decreased from 50.57% ten years ago to 48%.

The significant increase in grain and meat production has made the Chinese dining table more abundant. In 1949, there were only 13 combine harvesters nationwide, with a total grain output of 226.4 billion jin. By 2023, the total grain output had increased by 5.1 times to 1,390.8 billion jin.

Heilongjiang has maintained its position as the top grain-producing province in the country for 14 consecutive years, with a production of 155.764 billion jin in 2023. A new variety of millet in Henan, "Zhonggu 25," achieved a per-mu yield of 625.92 kilograms, setting a high-yield record for summer millet in the North China region.

Sichuan is the largest province in producing pork, beef, and mutton, with a production of 5.44 million tons, enough to feed 1 million people for 77 years. Inner Mongolia's beef and mutton production accounts for 10.1% and 21% of the national total, respectively.

China's per capita grain production has surpassed the internationally recognized food security line of 400 kilograms, reaching 493 kilograms. Local specialty agricultural products such as Dandong strawberries in Liaoning, Zengcheng lychees in Guangdong, Yangcheng Lake hairy crabs in Jiangsu, and Tan sheep in Ningxia are also widely enjoyed.

These changes not only reflect economic development but also demonstrate advancements in agricultural technology and the diversity of culinary culture.
