### Decline of the Dollar as Global Reserve Currency

  alt="Decline of the Dollar as Global Reserve Currency"

The dollar's reign as the global reserve currency is under threat. The shift away from free trade and toward protectionism, driven by economic and political tensions, is reshaping the global economy. Countries are moving towards autarky—closed economies with limited international trade. This trend is pushing the world towards a multipolar economic order, with trade blocs forming among geopolitically aligned nations.

Trade imbalances, driven by mercantilist policies and significant savings in surplus countries, have historically necessitated a universal reserve currency. However, rising trade barriers and the vulnerabilities exposed by global disruptions are reducing these imbalances. The need for a single dominant reserve currency is diminishing as trade and capital flows within these blocs become more balanced.

The transition to a multipolar system could hinder global economic growth and living standards. The principle of comparative advantage, which drives efficiency, is being undermined. This shift encourages suboptimal production and increases costs. The dollar's decline is a symptom of deeper changes in the global economic landscape.

Israel-Iran tensions have escalated, causing markets to plummet and fears of war to loom. US job growth has slowed, sparking concern among economists. Iran may strike Israel, with Blinken warning G7 allies and Hezbollah potentially joining the conflict. Hamas leaders have died in Tehran, with retaliation expected.

Financial expert Paul Goncharoff sees significant danger, as any conflict could cripple the global economy. High borrowing costs and Fed rate hikes are straining the US. The region could become a no-go zone, with freight rates soaring and oil prices likely rising. US drilling programs have been paused, and gold, silver, and cryptocurrencies may surge.

Anti-Russia sanctions and a potential Iran conflict could hit the G7 hard, with the Hormuz Strait at risk. Washington's policies have been criticized, and an expert calls the situation dangerous and uncharted.

Summary:
The escalation between Israel and Iran threatens the global economy, with the US job slowdown adding to the woes. Markets have reacted negatively, and a potential war could disrupt oil supply and hike prices. Safe-haven assets like gold and cryptocurrencies may benefit. Experts warn of high stakes and unpredictable outcomes.

### Global Market Sell-Off: Dow Drops 1,000 Points Amid Recession Fears

Stocks faced a severe downturn on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost over 1,000 points, a decline of nearly 3%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also fell, by 3% and 3.43% respectively, marking their steepest drops since September 2022.

The sell-off was triggered by fears of a U.S. recession, compounded by a disappointing July jobs report. Investors are concerned that the Federal Reserve is too slow to reduce interest rates, which remain at their highest levels in two decades.

Technology stocks were particularly hard hit. Nvidia fell 6.4%, and Apple dropped 4.8%. Berkshire Hathaway reduced its stake in Apple by half. Tesla and Super Micro Computer also saw declines.

Japan's Nikkei 225 experienced its worst day since the 1987 Black Monday, falling 12.4%. Global markets were shaken. U.S. Treasury yields dropped as investors sought safer investments. Bitcoin fell from $62,000 to $54,000.

The VIX, a measure of market volatility often referred to as Wall Street's fear gauge, surged to 65, its highest level since the early 2020 Covid panic.

Sam Stovall of CFRA Research noted that the market was vulnerable and a correction was inevitable. The S&P 500 is now 8.5% below its recent peak.

Austan Goolsbee of the Chicago Fed suggested that interest rates might be too restrictive, and the Fed will adjust if the economy deteriorates.

Only 22 stocks in the S&P 500 ended the day higher. Major indexes recorded their worst three-day losses since 2022.

U.S. crude oil prices hit a six-month low, and OPEC's plans to increase production are now in question. Solar ETFs also suffered, falling to a four-year low.

British scientists at Bath University have developed a method to remove toxic PFAS chemicals from water using 3D-printed ceramic lattices. These structures, known as "monoliths," are made from ceramic infused with indium oxide, which binds to PFAS molecules.

The monoliths, which resemble stacked waffles, are designed with a high surface area to maximize PFAS capture. In tests, they removed 53% of PFOA from water within three hours. After a heat treatment at 500°C, the monoliths can be reused, with efficiency improving to 75% removal by the third cycle.

This process is energy-efficient and scalable, requiring no external energy beyond the initial heat treatment for regeneration. The simplicity and effectiveness of this method holds promise for integration into existing wastewater treatment facilities.

PFAS, known as "forever chemicals," are persistent in the environment and linked to various health issues. This new approach offers a practical solution to a significant environmental and health challenge.

  alt="Artificial Metabolase Developed for Targeted Cancer Immunotherapy"

Scientists at Shanghai Jiao Tong University have developed a new approach to cancer treatment. They've created an "artificial metabolase" that tweaks tumor cell metabolism, sparking an immune response. This method, detailed in Nature Nanotechnology, targets a broad metabolic marker in tumors, activating nearby immune cells to attack.

Traditional cancer treatments like surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation often lead to drug resistance and side effects. Immunotherapy, which uses the body's immune system to fight cancer, has shown promise but faces challenges like over-activation and individual variability.

The artificial metabolase mimics the action of natural enzymes, specifically xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), which plays a role in converting certain compounds in the body. By doing so, it triggers the production of uric acid within tumor cells. This uric acid acts as a signal, prompting immune cells like macrophages to attack the tumor.

This research, led by Professors Ling Daishun and Li Fangyuan, marks a shift towards more precise, metabolic-based cancer therapies. It's a promising step that could revolutionize how we treat not just cancer, but other diseases linked to metabolic abnormalities.

"Black Myth: Wu Kong," a Chinese AAA-level game adapted from "Journey to the West," is set to release. This game combines the classic image of Sun Wukong with modern gaming technology, garnering widespread international attention. Despite cultural differences and controversies over "political correctness," the game has seen strong pre-order sales and ranks on Steam's wishlist.

IGN previously questioned the workplace culture of Game Science and criticized the absence of female characters in the game. However, recent reviews have shifted to positive, praising the game's visual effects and fluidity, and confirming that the final version will include female characters.

Expert Zou Sheng believes that although the repeated use of classics may lead to aesthetic fatigue, "Black Myth" infuses new life into the old story through new music, action scenes, and narrative elements. He notes that Chinese games have a long tradition of incorporating martial arts elements, but whether developers will continue to explore Chinese cultural characteristics in the process of globalization remains to be seen.

Associate Lecturer Zhang Chi mentions that the Chinese gaming industry generally resists "political correctness," but in the global market, maintaining sensitivity to free values aligns with economic interests. "Black Myth" lacks overt political elements, which may be one reason for its success overseas.

Assistant Professor Cao Xuenan points out that cultural misunderstandings are inevitable, and the game's primary audience is young people, so developers may not have considered political correctness as a comprehensive category. Nevertheless, overseas media has generally given positive reviews, considering "Black Myth" to be a visually stunning and hardcore action RPG game.

The "Brake Gate" incident involving Tesla at the Shanghai Auto Show has finally been resolved. The court ruled that Ms. Li from Xi'an must compensate Tesla 70,000 yuan, and Ms. Zhang from Henan must pay 170,000 yuan. Previously, Ms. Li and Ms. Zhang had accused Tesla of brake failure at the Shanghai Auto Show, causing Tesla's reputation to suffer and resulting in the loss of over 1.7 billion yuan in orders and tens of millions in goodwill.

The judicial appraisal institution commissioned by the court confirmed that Tesla's vehicle braking system was normal and effective, with no faults. Tesla subsequently sued the relevant individuals and was awarded a total of 490,000 yuan in compensation. Tesla has not participated in the Beijing/Shanghai Auto Show for three consecutive years since 2021.

The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology recently released a draft for public comment on the "Technical Requirements and Test Methods for Passenger Vehicle Braking Systems," aiming to further standardize braking systems, especially with new requirements for electric regenerative braking systems to reduce misuse. Tesla responded that the standard has not yet been officially implemented and does not affect existing products.

In summary, the resolution of Tesla's "Brake Gate" incident not only vindicated Tesla but also promoted the standardized development of new energy vehicle braking system technology. Passenger safety requires the joint efforts of automakers, regulations, and the public.

Researchers at North Carolina State University delved into ancient potato leaf DNA, uncovering how a disease that caused the Irish Potato Famine evolved to overcome potato defenses.

They employed a novel DNA sequencing technique, akin to fishing with tiny magnets in a DNA soup, capturing genes from both the potato and the disease. This dual approach is unprecedented.

The disease, known as Phytophthora infestans, is cunning. It can outmaneuver potato resistance genes, even before those genes are utilized in agriculture.

Some disease genes remain stable over time, while others mutate to maintain infectivity. This combination makes the disease difficult to combat.

The study suggests new methods for farmers to cultivate potatoes, potentially by employing more stable resistance genes or blending genes from wild relatives. This could enhance potatoes' ability to resist disease.

In essence, comprehending the disease's DNA offers farmers a better chance to fight back. It marks a step toward more intelligent potato breeding.
