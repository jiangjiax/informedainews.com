# World News Daily(2024-08-01) : China Advances Legislation to Boost Private Sector Involvement in National Strategies

## China Advances Legislation to Boost Private Sector Involvement in National Strategies

The National Development and Reform Commission is formulating the Private Economic Promotion Law, aimed at improving the institutional mechanisms for private enterprises to participate in national major strategies. This initiative includes protecting business property rights and entrepreneurs' rights and interests, optimizing financing support policies for private enterprises, and promoting fair access for operators in competitive infrastructure sectors.

State-owned enterprise reform will strengthen the management of state-owned economy, optimize its layout and structure. At the same time, it will promote the improvement of modern enterprise systems with Chinese characteristics, fostering more world-class enterprises and facilitating the joint development of various forms of ownership economies.

These measures are designed to invigorate enterprise vitality and implement the "two unswervingly" principles: resolutely consolidating and developing the public sector of the economy, and resolutely encouraging, supporting, and guiding the development of the non-public sector of the economy.

### U.S. Copyright Office Calls for AI Impersonation Law

The U.S. Copyright Office warns of AI-powered impersonation. They call for a new law to protect against unauthorized digital replicas. These replicas, made easily and cheaply from public data, threaten reputations and livelihoods.

The Office recommends liability for distributing these replicas, not just creating them. Protection should last a lifetime, with options for postmortem extension if needed. They suggest a safe harbor for online platforms to remove unauthorized replicas upon notice.

This law should mirror existing copyright protections but allow states to add extra measures. The Office's focus is on intellectual property, but the issue also touches on privacy and ethics.

In crafting this law, basing it on effective existing legislation might be wiser than starting from scratch.

### China Proposes National Internet ID System Amid Privacy and Control Debates

China is planning to introduce a national internet ID system, which would replace current company verifications that use phone numbers linked to personal IDs. The government asserts that this system will protect privacy and combat fraud, but critics view it as a means to tighten online control.

The proposal is currently open for public feedback and suggests that websites and apps may voluntarily adopt the ID. Although China's internet has historically been subject to monitoring, this initiative could potentially centralize surveillance efforts.

Some individuals support the ID due to concerns about privacy breaches by various apps, while others, such as Professor Lao Dongyan, believe it is a pretext for heightened social control, comparing it to the health code app employed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Professor Shen Kui cautions against the risks of a centralized ID, fearing it could discourage internet use. The ongoing debate underscores concerns about state power and individual freedoms in the digital era.

### U.S. Increases Military Aid to Philippines Amid South China Sea Tensions

The U.S. pledges $500 million in new military aid to the Philippines. This move deepens the defense alliance as China asserts claims in the South China Sea. Biden and Marcos strengthen ties, unlike Marcos' predecessor who leaned towards China.

The U.S. and Philippines held their first 2+2 session in Manila. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III attended. The meeting focused on countering aggressive Chinese actions in the South China Sea.

The $500 million aid will modernize the Philippine military and coast guard. This funding is unprecedented, signaling strong U.S. support. The U.S. also gained access to four additional Philippine military bases earlier this year.

Tensions peak in the South China Sea. Chinese coast guard vessels have harassed Philippine ships. In one incident, a Philippine sailor lost a thumb. The U.S.-Philippine treaty's mutual defense clause applies to these actions.

China recently allowed a Philippine resupply mission to the Sierra Madre ship without interference. Blinken urged China to refrain from further hostilities against the Philippines in the South China Sea.

The U.S., along with Japan, India, and Australia, denounced military aggression in the South and East China Seas. This joint stance aims to deter China's assertive territorial moves.

/>

The team led by Dr. David Liu has recently upgraded their gene editing system, named eePASSIGE. This technology can precisely insert large gene fragments into designated positions of the DNA in mammalian cells, significantly improving both efficiency and accuracy.

Traditional gene editing requires modifying each mutation individually, whereas eePASSIGE does not. It achieves a leap in gene insertion efficiency by improving the DNA serine recombinase Bxb1. This means that in the future, a single gene editing therapy might be able to treat diseases caused by multiple gene mutations.

This technology is not only expected to enhance ex vivo therapies such as CAR-T immune cell therapy but can also be applied to synthetic biology, optimizing the production of medicinal proteins, and even improving crop traits and yield.

Dr. Xin Gao is one of the main contributors to this research. He used AI technology to predict the structure of Bxb1, optimized experimental conditions, and improved editing efficiency. His next goal is to develop new delivery methods to address the challenges of delivering large molecular editors.

The research by Dr. David Liu's team not only breaks through technical barriers but also brings new hope for the treatment of genetic diseases.

### Leaf: Revolutionizing Farm Data Management with Technology

Farms generate a wealth of data. Tractors, irrigation systems, all produce numbers. The issue? This data is scattered and disorganized. Enter Leaf, which can be thought of as Plaid for farms.

Bailey Stockdale, CEO of Leaf, witnessed the traditional methods used on his family's farm—like planting seeds based on a thermometer buried in the soil. He recognized that technology could offer a solution. While farms were accumulating data, they lacked the means to utilize it effectively. Stockdale reached out to various sources but found no definitive solutions, prompting him to create Leaf.

Leaf organizes and streamlines farm data, integrating it into an API that is utilized by crop insurers, agricultural technology startups, and more, with payment structured per acre. Since its launch in 2021, Leaf has partnered with major companies like Bayer and Syngenta.

Leaf has secured $11.3 million in funding. Its future plans include expanding sales and refining its product. The company is focused on enhancing data accuracy, a critical factor for AI models that predict crop planting and fertilizer application.

Stockdale views agriculture as a blend of traditional and modern practices. Leaf, functioning as an API in a rustic setting, is successfully bridging this gap.

Almost half of dementia cases worldwide could be prevented or delayed. A study identified 14 risk factors.

By addressing these factors from childhood through old age, 45% of dementia cases could be avoided. This includes high "bad" cholesterol from age 40 and untreated vision loss later in life.

The 14 factors: lower education, hearing impairment, high blood pressure, smoking, obesity, depression, physical inactivity, diabetes, excessive alcohol, brain injury, air pollution, social isolation.

Healthy lifestyles—exercise, no smoking, cognitive activity, moderate alcohol—can delay dementia onset.

Recommendations include hearing aids for hearing loss, cholesterol checks from 40, and good-quality education.

Public health interventions could save billions by reducing dementia rates and improving health.

Age and genetics are still top risk factors, but lifestyle and health factors offer a chance for prevention.
