# World News Daily(2024-08-27) : Marine Scientist Leads UN Body on Deep-Sea Mining Governance

## Marine Scientist Leads UN Body on Deep-Sea Mining Governance

Leticia Carvalho, a Brazilian marine scientist, will lead the International Seabed Authority (ISA) starting in 2025. She is the first woman, oceanographer, and Latin American to hold this role. The ISA, a UN body, manages deep-sea mining, covering 54% of the world's oceans.

Deep-sea mining involves extracting minerals like cobalt and nickel from seabed nodules. These minerals are crucial for electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies. However, environmentalists warn of irreversible damage to marine ecosystems.

Carvalho emphasizes the need for a clear mining code before any extraction begins. She aims to rebuild trust and ensure transparency within the ISA. Her focus is on governance and environmental protection.

Recent studies, such as the discovery of "dark oxygen" production deep in the ocean, highlight the unknown impacts of mining. Over 30 countries now support a moratorium on deep-sea mining, urging caution.

Carvalho welcomes the debate, seeing it as essential for the ISA's future. She believes environmental safeguards must be part of the mining code, ensuring protection of the deep ocean.

UN chief Guterres warns Pacific islands face grave danger from rising seas. He urges global action before it's too late.

Sea-surface temps in the south-west Pacific have risen three times faster than the global average since 1980. Marine heatwaves have doubled in frequency and intensified.

Last year, 34 hydrometeorological hazard events in the region led to over 200 deaths and affected 25 million people.

The climate crisis and sea-level rise are no longer distant threats, especially for small island developing states. Sea-level rise is caused by melting land ice and seawater expansion due to warming.

Guterres calls for a drastic slash in global emissions and a fast, fair phase-out of fossil fuels. He demands a massive increase in finance and support for vulnerable countries.

Civil-society groups urge Australia to step up and support Pacific neighbors. Australia's climate finance contributions are falling short of need.

Pacific communities endure severe climate impacts despite contributing the least to the crisis. The climate emergency deepens debt and gender inequality in the region.

Brazil's Environment Minister, Marina Silva, has declared a "war" on fire. A surge in blazes across the country, from the Amazon to São Paulo, has blanketed cities in smoke, grounded flights, and closed schools. Federal police are investigating the spike in wildfires, which some fear mirrors the 2019 "Day of Fire" under Bolsonaro's presidency.

Silva described the simultaneous burning of multiple municipalities as unprecedented. She visited the environment protection agency Ibama with President Lula, emphasizing the fight against both fire and crime.

The Amazon and the Pantanal wetland have faced severe fires this year, attributed to drought and El Niño. São Paulo, Brazil's economic powerhouse, has seen rural areas ravaged by flames, with social media flooded by images of smoky skies.

In Brasília, the capital, and nearby Goiânia, smoke disrupted daily life and air travel. Ibama's director, Rodrigo Agostinho, noted that while drought made areas vulnerable, fires are typically man-made, either for land clearance or malicious intent.

Firefighters struggle to contain the blazes, with fears of worsening conditions through October. Agostinho highlighted the challenge of extinguishing fires only to see them reignited nearby. The cycle must end.

Coffee's impact on health hinges on your genes. Sandra Sanchez-Roige, a researcher at the University of California, San Diego, led a study comparing coffee habits in the U.S. and the U.K. using genetic data from 23andMe and the UK Biobank.

The study, published in Neuropsychopharmacology, found genetic links to coffee consumption. Specific gene mutations inherited from parents influence how much coffee one drinks.

However, the health effects of coffee remain unclear. The research showed mixed results: positive genetic associations with harmful outcomes like obesity and drug use, but also potential protective traits.

Differences in data collection methods and cultural preferences complicate the findings. For instance, the type of coffee consumed—instant in the U.K. versus ground in the U.S.—and the inclusion of sugar in American coffee affect results.

The study underscores the interplay between genetics and environment. A person's genetic makeup can lead to different behaviors and choices depending on their surroundings.

More research is needed to fully understand these interactions and their implications for health.

In a study by Florida University, beer yeast thrived in simulated microgravity. The team, led by Andrew MacIntosh, found faster fermentation with less ester production. Esters, compounds affecting beer flavor, were fewer in microgravity.

The experiment used a device called a clinostat to mimic weightlessness. Yeast suspended in this environment absorbed nutrients better, speeding up fermentation. A key gene, known to regulate ester production, showed lower activity in microgravity.

MacIntosh sees this as a starting point. The implications for space-based brewing and other fermentation processes are promising. This research could refine beer quality and expand our capabilities in space.
