Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has been appointed as the head of Bangladesh's interim government, succeeding long-time Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who resigned amidst violent protests and fled to India. Yunus, renowned for his pioneering work in microcredit and awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006, was appointed following advocacy by student protest leaders, military officials, and civil society representatives. In response to the protests, which resulted in hundreds of deaths, Yunus urged the nation to maintain peace and avoid violence, referring to Hasina's resignation as the "second Liberation Day."

A Pakistani man, Asif Merchant, faces charges in the U.S. for plotting to kill American politicians in retaliation for the 2020 drone strike that killed Iranian General Qassim Soleimani. The plot, thwarted by law enforcement, involved recruiting U.S. residents to carry out the assassinations.

Merchant, who allegedly spent time in Iran, was arrested and charged with murder for hire. A federal judge detained him in New York. The Justice Department is aggressively countering Iran's efforts to retaliate against U.S. officials for Soleimani's death.

The intended targets of the plot remain unnamed. Merchant discussed potential targets with an informant, noting the tight security around one. The Iranian government denies involvement, stating their policy is to legally prosecute Soleimani's killers.

No link has been found between Merchant and a recent assassination attempt on former President Trump. Law enforcement intercepted Merchant's plans before any attacks occurred. He also planned to steal documents and organize protests in the U.S.

Archaeologists have discovered a 12,000-year-old calendar at the Göbekli Tepe site in Turkey. This discovery traces the earliest human timekeeping wisdom back to 9600 BC, thousands of years before the ancient Greek calendar. The calendar is carved on stone pillars, marking 365 days, and records a comet impact event that occurred around 13,000 years ago, which was of a massive scale and had profound effects. The impact prompted humans to transition from hunting and gathering to settled agriculture, accelerating the evolution of civilization. Göbekli Tepe is one of the oldest known cities, witnessing the birth of the agricultural revolution and the early forms of civilization.

### Warner Bros. Discovery Faces Financial Challenges and Shifts Focus to Streaming

Warner Bros. Discovery's stock took a hit, sliding about 9% after reporting a $9.1 billion write-down on TV networks. The company also missed revenue estimates, bringing in $9.7 billion instead of the expected $10.07 billion.

The write-down stems from a reevaluation of TV network values, reflecting a shift away from traditional TV as viewers and advertisers move to digital and streaming platforms. CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels noted this shift during the earnings call, emphasizing the company's focus on studios and streaming growth.

CEO David Zaslav acknowledged the changing market conditions for legacy media, aligning the company's values with future prospects. Warner Bros. Discovery is aggressively paying down debt, reducing it by $1.8 billion in the second quarter, leaving $41.4 billion in gross debt and $3.6 billion in cash.

The company faces uncertainties with future sports rights, including a lawsuit against the NBA over media rights. TV network revenue dipped 8% to $5.27 billion, with declines in both distribution and advertising.

In contrast, the streaming business, centered on Max, added 3.6 million subscribers, reaching 103.3 million globally. Streaming advertising revenue surged 99%, driven by increased engagement and subscriber growth. Despite a 5% drop in direct-to-consumer streaming revenue, the platform shows promise with international expansion and ad spending.

Warner Bros. Discovery is also exploring streaming bundles with Disney and Fox, aiming to boost profitability.

### Delayed IPOs: Tech Startups Postpone Public Listings to 2025

Investors initially anticipated a strong 2024 IPO market, but it appears to be losing steam. Only four technology IPOs took place this year, in March and April. Broader economic factors, including the impending presidential election and elevated interest rates, indicate that the IPO market may not fully recover until 2025.

This year could still surpass 2023, with several additional public filings anticipated. Klarna and Shein are on the verge, though their IPO schedules remain uncertain.

Several prominent companies have decided against going public this year:

- **Skims**: Kim Kardashian’s brand, valued at $4 billion, is targeting 2025.
- **Chime**: The fintech startup, which saw its valuation increase by 25% in the past six months, is aiming for 2025.
- **CoreWeave**: The AI company, which raised $1.1 billion in May, is planning for 2025.
- **Sword Health**: The virtual physical therapy startup is also planning for 2025.
- **Plaid**: The B2B fintech company has no plans for a 2024 IPO.
- **Figma**: The design unicorn's actions suggest it will not pursue a 2024 IPO.
- **Stripe**: The fintech unicorn, valued at $65 billion, is likely to hold off.
- **Databricks**: The AI cloud platform, which raised $500 million, is eyeing 2025.
- **Canva**: The design startup might delay until 2026.

These companies continue to grow, secure funding, and prepare for more favorable market conditions. The IPO frenzy is merely delayed, not extinguished.

Suntory, a Japanese distiller, aims to dominate the global ready-to-drink (RTD) market by 2030. RTDs include canned cocktails and hard seltzer. CEO Takeshi Niinami sees potential in combining Suntory's strengths in soft drinks and alcohol.

The company plans a $437 million plant in Australia, its first overseas facility producing both soft drinks and RTDs. Suntory Global Spirits, formerly Beam Suntory, leads product development.

Suntory's -196 vodka seltzer, launched in Japan in 2005, now sells in Germany and the U.S. Consumers favor its natural, fruity taste. RTDs, less restricted than beer or whisky, grew 13% annually from 2020 to 2023 and could top $50 billion by 2030.

Suntory acquired U.S. distiller Beam in 2014 for $1.6 trillion, aiming to boost spirits sales. Despite initial resistance, Beam now integrates well, with high participation in Suntory University.

Overseas revenue rose from 25% to 52% of total sales from 2013 to 2023. Suntory ranks second in RTD volume, third in sales. Mark Anthony Brands International leads with White Claw hard seltzers.

Niinami focuses on adapting products to local tastes, aiming for a "gold medal" in RTDs. He plans to pass leadership to Nobuhiro Torii, a great-grandson of Suntory's founder.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III has introduced a temporary WWE-themed mode called Slam Deathmatch. This mode, running alongside WWE SummerSlam, features wrestling-style finishing moves on downed opponents. Players use the right joystick to execute maneuvers like chair smashes or Cross Rhodes finishers, while a WWE announcer reacts.

The mode is simple: it's Team Deathmatch on smaller maps, with enemies downed instead of killed, and grenades disabled. Players can't take damage during a finisher but can be interrupted. The chaos and novelty of the mode, combined with the use of WWE superstar skins like Rhea Ripley, make it a refreshing break from typical FPS gameplay.

Slam Deathmatch is available for a limited time, offering a unique blend of wrestling and shooter elements that remind players of Call of Duty's potential for fun and innovation.

### Revolutionary Gene-Editing Therapy Approved for NHS

Gene-editing therapy utilizing Crispr technology has been approved for the NHS. It targets beta thalassaemia, a blood disorder. Stem cells are extracted, reprogrammed, and reinserted with the aim of eliminating lifelong blood transfusions.

Beta thalassaemia is a genetic condition that affects haemoglobin production, causing symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath, and reducing life expectancy. Kirthana Balachandran, diagnosed at three months, experiences muscle pain, back pain, and palpitations.

Crispr, a Nobel Prize-winning tool, functions like a satnav and scissors, targeting and editing DNA. The therapy disables the BCL11A switch, restoring fetal haemoglobin production. Stem cells are harvested, sent to a lab, and then reintroduced after chemotherapy.

Abdul-Qadeer Akhtar, a 28-year-old clinical trial participant, describes the treatment as tough but transformative, leading to improved health and increased activity, including taking up boxing. Out of 52 patients, 49 have been transfusion-free for at least a year, although long-term effects are unknown.

The therapy has been approved by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence, with the NHS paying less than £1.6 million per patient. It is offered to 460 eligible patients at seven specialist centres. Beta thalassaemia is prevalent among Mediterranean, south Asian, south-east Asian, and Middle Eastern populations.

Vertex's Casgevy is the first Crispr-based therapy. The UK Thalassaemia Society calls it a revolutionary breakthrough and a beacon of hope. Negotiations are underway for a treatment for sickle cell anaemia.

  alt="New Research Challenges Training Optimization Based on Menstrual Cycles"
/>

New research from UiT The Arctic University of Norway challenges the idea of optimizing training based on menstrual cycles. The study, part of the FENDURA project, tested female endurance athletes across different menstrual phases. Key findings: no general fitness or performance benefits tied to cycle phases.

Tests included submaximal intervals, a 30-second full-effort ski ergometer, and a maximal treadmill run. Results showed no group-level impact from cycle phases on physical fitness. However, individual variations exist. Some athletes performed better or worse in specific phases, but these patterns aren't universal.

This research suggests a "one-size-fits-all" training approach based on menstrual cycles isn't effective. Instead, individual tracking and adjustments might be necessary. The study also highlights the importance of including women in sports science research, as menstrual cycles don't generally skew results.

The findings underscore the need for more research on what constitutes a "normal" menstrual cycle. Understanding individual experiences and variations is crucial for tailored training and health strategies.

Research from Texas A&M University reveals that reducing folate intake may promote healthy aging. Folate, a B-vitamin commonly found in leafy greens, is crucial for cell growth. Traditional thinking has been that more folate is better, but new findings suggest that moderate reductions in folate intake can enhance metabolic flexibility, particularly beneficial for older adults.

The research team observed improved metabolic flexibility, good maintenance of body weight and fat, and no adverse effects such as anemia in animal models with restricted folate intake. This challenges traditional views and supports personalized dietary advice, emphasizing that folate needs change with age.

Dr. Polymenys, the lead researcher, stresses the need for further study on the mechanisms of folate restriction and to explore safe and effective interventions for promoting healthy aging. He cautions that while new findings have emerged, it is not recommended to completely avoid folate intake, especially for specific groups like children and pregnant women.

This study offers new perspectives on precision nutrition and personalized diets, and also opens new avenues for developing folate-restricting medications tailored for the elderly.
