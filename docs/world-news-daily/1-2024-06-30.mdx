In 2007, Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone. Development began in 2005 under strict secrecy. The device was met with amazement upon launch but reached stores months later.

Apple partnered with Cingular Wireless (now AT&T) for the iPhone's network. Development costs approached $1.5 billion. Apple maintained full control over both hardware and software.

Prior to release, Jobs switched the screen from plastic to glass after scratching the prototype. Foxconn took over production.

The iPhone debuted at $499 for 4GB and $599 for 8GB. Despite the high price, demand soared. Stores sold out within hours. Theft risks prompted off-duty police to guard shops.

In the first week, Apple sold 270,000 iPhones. By the 74th day, sales reached one million. By October 2007, it ranked fourth in U.S. phone sales.

In 2008, Apple introduced a 16GB model at $499. The original models were phased out later that year, having sold over six million units.

The first iPhone laid the groundwork for Apple's smartphone dominance. The upcoming iPhone 16 promises advancements beyond the original's reach. Without that first iPhone, none of this would exist.

China now claims all rare-earth resources as state property. This rule, effective October 1, tightens control over the entire supply chain—from mining to export.

Rare earths are crucial metals used in many technologies, including electric vehicles and missiles. China dominates global production, accounting for about 70% in 2023.

This move is part of China's strategy to secure its industrial and resource sectors, especially as the U.S. tries to reduce its reliance on Chinese imports for these materials.

The regulation aims to prevent illegal mining and smelting, emphasizing state control, safety, innovation, and green development.

China's actions reflect broader tensions with the U.S., which has also restricted Chinese access to advanced chip technology. This regulation is a response to those challenges, ensuring China maintains leverage in critical materials.

### Supreme Court's Decision on Trump's Immunity and Other Key Rulings

The Supreme Court concluded a busy term, ruling on issues such as abortion, guns, environment, health, opioids, securities fraud, and homelessness. The major question now is: Will Trump be immune from prosecution for his involvement in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot?

The court's decision, anticipated in early July, is likely to postpone any trial until after the November election. This timing aligns with Trump's legal team's strategy, who have sought delays in all four criminal cases against him.

Critics contend that the court's deliberate pace provides Trump with "immunity by delay." A federal appeals court previously dismissed his immunity claim, but the Supreme Court has agreed to review his appeal.

The court also addresses state laws restricting social media content regulation, in response to conservative allegations of liberal bias and censorship.

In a different action, the justices dismissed a lawsuit against the Biden administration, which accused it of exerting improper pressure on social media to remove controversial posts.

A 428-year-old document, hidden in the National Archives, has revealed Elizabeth I's spy network. Robert Cecil, her spymaster, organized this network to gather intelligence on European monarchs. Historian Stephen Alford discovered the document, titled "The names of the Intelligencers," and has spent years reconstructing Cecil's espionage files.

Cecil's network was extensive, involving over 20 spies in various European cities. These spies were mostly international merchants, chosen for their travel abilities, language skills, and existing networks. Each spy sent coded reports to Cecil, who decrypted them using individual ciphers.

Alford believes this network was the first properly organized secret service in England. Cecil's meticulous organization and funding allowed him to operate effectively, providing accurate information rather than mere gossip. This discovery sheds new light on Elizabethan espionage and Cecil's role in it.

### Global Concerns Rise as Hezbollah and Israel Face Off

U.S., Europe, and Arab mediators urge Hezbollah to halt attacks on Israel, fearing a broader Middle East war. Hezbollah, stronger than Hamas, faces warnings not to challenge Israel's military might. The group should not rely on U.S. intervention to deter Israel if it invades Lebanon.

Recent strikes between Israel and Hezbollah have plateaued, but tensions remain high. The U.S. has deployed an amphibious assault ship to the region to deter conflict. Israel and Hezbollah possess significant firepower, capable of causing heavy casualties.

U.N. humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths describes a potential war as "apocalyptic." Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warns of catastrophic consequences for Lebanon. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant emphasizes readiness for various scenarios.

Iran-allied militias in the region could escalate hostilities. Iran, focused on domestic politics, views Hezbollah as a strategic partner. The U.S. may intervene if Israel faces serious threats.

Hezbollah's arsenal includes an estimated 150,000 rockets and missiles. Israeli leaders threaten Gaza-like devastation on Lebanon if war erupts. Diplomatic efforts by the U.S., France, and other European nations aim to reduce tensions.

White House officials support Israel's right to defend itself but caution against opening a second front. They acknowledge the possibility of a major escalation.

### Asteroid Bennu's Oceanic Origins and Life's Potential Beginnings

Scientists discovered water-soluble magnesium-sodium phosphate in rocks from asteroid Bennu. This mineral was unexpected and not previously identified in earlier data. It suggests that Bennu might have originated from an ocean world.

Phosphate compounds are essential for life, being part of DNA's structure. The samples from Bennu indicate a history involving water. The asteroid is rich in carbon and could contain clues about the origins of life. Some fragments might even date back to before the solar system.

NASA's OSIRIS-Rex mission, launched in 2016, retrieved these samples, marking the first time the U.S. has collected asteroid material. These findings support the need for further research on asteroids like Bennu.

Bennu's samples are now available for global research. Scientists aim to track the evolution of simple carbon molecules into complex life-supporting chemicals. The discovery of amino acids or nucleic acids in these samples could be a significant breakthrough.

Bennu's rocky composition and possible connections to ocean worlds like Enceladus deepen its intrigue. The mission's success highlights the importance of asteroid research in understanding the beginnings of life.

### Record Fires Ravage Brazil's Pantanal Wetlands Early

Brazil’s Pantanal, the world’s largest tropical wetlands, is burning. Fires typically flare from July to September, but June saw a record 2,500 blazes, more than six times the number in June 2020. Environment Minister Marina Silva calls it one of the worst situations ever seen.

The Pantanal, a biodiversity hotspot, is drying up. The Paraguay River basin is experiencing severe water scarcity. Fires are devouring the flora and charred animals. Silva attributes the fires to human activity, climate change, and prolonged effects of El Nino and La Nina phenomena.

The federal government has deployed 285 agents and 82 National Guard members to support local fire brigades. Fire committees, including government branches and environmental nonprofits, discuss fire management and train local communities in prevention and early response.

Manuel Garcia da Silva, head of a fire brigade, says most fires are underground, burning through nearly a meter of material under the soil. His brigade spends seven hours a day fighting fires.

Conditions are more severe than in 2020. Expectations for extreme drought in August and September are causing alarm. Renata Libonati, a meteorology professor, says the vegetation is under stress, predisposed to burning. Since January, fires have destroyed over 688,000 hectares.

Most fires are likely human-caused. Minister Silva says 85% originate in private properties. Traditional farmers use fire to manage pasture areas, despite the ban.

Environmental organizations had warned of the danger long before the fires. A study found that dry and semi-arid areas have expanded across Brazil over the past 30 years. The Pantanal has dried up most since 1985.

/>

The team from Beihang University has recently developed a super-resolution photonic force microscope, achieving sub-femtonewton-level mechanical sensing in aqueous solutions for the first time. It detected the smallest electric field force at 108.2 aN, with a sensitivity of 1.8 fN/√Hz. This technology combines ion resonance nanoprobes, optical three-dimensional super-resolution positioning, and machine learning, addressing the challenge of weak force measurements in aqueous solutions.

The microscope has broad application prospects, particularly in studying extremely weak interactions between DNA molecules. Traditional theories suggest that complementary DNA strands require close contact to pair in aqueous solutions, but this new tool reveals the possibility of long-range forces. Additionally, the technology can be used to study interactions of molecules such as CRISPR proteins.

Detecting extremely weak forces in aqueous solutions is crucial for understanding the operation of biological molecules. Previously, the highest sensitivity for force measurements in aqueous solutions was about 10 fN/√Hz, but the new method has elevated this to sub-femtonewton levels, providing an effective tool for studying long-range interactions of biological molecules in physiological environments.

Through theoretical analysis and experimental verification, the team improved force measurement accuracy by using lower potential well stiffness, higher positioning precision, and a large amount of positioning data. They also introduced a cylindrical lens positioning method from super-resolution imaging to refine the final steps of three-dimensional force measurement.

This research is not only scientifically significant but also opens new avenues for future studies on biological molecules.

### San Francisco Bookstore Sends LGBTQ+ Books to Banned States

Becka Robbins operates "Books Not Bans" from Fabulosa Books in San Francisco's Castro District. She ships LGBTQ+ books to states that have banned them. Robbins utilizes customer donations to dispatch books that explore queer history, sexuality, and romance. From July 2022 to June 2023, over 40% of book bans occurred in Florida, with Texas and Missouri following closely.

Book bans have reached unprecedented levels, impacting both school and public libraries. PEN America notes that 30% of banned books feature characters of color or address race, and another 30% contain LGBTQ+ themes. Conservative groups such as Moms for Liberty advocate for these bans, citing sexually explicit content, although 38% of their objections relate to LGBTQ+ themes.

So far, Robbins has distributed 740 books, each valued between $300 and $400. At the Rose Dynasty Center in Lakeland, Florida, these donated books have found a place on the shelves. Jason DeShazo, a drag queen who manages the center, strives to offer a safe haven and a collection of banned books.

Robbins prefers to send young adult queer romances, a genre that is expanding and reflecting broader discussions about LGBTQ+ topics. These books depict ordinary kids—ordinary people who happen to be queer—experiencing love and happiness.

The system comprises components such as a six-degree-of-freedom UR3 robotic arm and a linear ultrasound probe, which can automatically approach the neck, navigate, and detect nodules. The team has validated the system's accuracy and reliability through clinical tests.

During a test, a team member unexpectedly discovered a malignant thyroid tumor, prompting him to change his lifestyle, undergo active treatment, and eventually regain his health. This experience underscores the importance of early detection.

The system is expected to address the shortage of ultrasound services in primary healthcare settings, enhance diagnostic accuracy and consistency, and drive innovation and development in related technologies.

The team plans to conduct clinical validation in more medical institutions, collect data, optimize the system, and ensure its broad applicability and reliability.

Research on Alzheimer's disease has encountered a significant setback. A Nature paper cited nearly 2500 times, due to fabrication, faces retraction and could have misled research for up to 18 years. Two experts, Chen Yelin and Leng Lige, discuss the disease's pathogenesis and the latest research progress. Chen Yelin focuses on neurobiology and chemical biology, while Leng Lige studies Alzheimer's disease from the perspective of altered neural cell metabolic networks.

Alzheimer's disease, commonly known as senile dementia, primarily affects memory and cognitive functions. Its pathogenesis is complex, involving genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Treatment options include medications and non-pharmacological interventions, but the development of new drugs faces numerous challenges.

The falsifiability of scientific research is its core characteristic, and clinical trials and new drug development are crucial steps in validating hypotheses. Alzheimer's disease not only affects memory but can also lead to emotional and behavioral issues. Care for patients requires patience and specialized knowledge.

Screening and early diagnosis are key to prevention and treatment. Alzheimer's disease could become the next major disease affecting human lifespan.

Zoonotic diseases, which are those that can jump from animals to humans, are on the rise in Asia. Factors such as population growth, deforestation, and climate change are driving this trend. Recent examples include the H5N1 and H5N6 strains of bird flu, which have affected poultry across several Asian countries.

The "One Health" approach, which integrates human, animal, and environmental health, is crucial. It necessitates collaboration across various sectors and disciplines. Livestock health is particularly important, given its role in food security and livelihoods for many in Asia.

Heifer International's Community Agrovet Entrepreneurs (CAVE) program trains local individuals to manage animal health. This model not only improves livestock care but also empowers women and enhances community awareness of health interconnections.

Rajni Hembran, a CAVE participant in India, provides on-site animal care, boosting local livestock health and productivity. Her work exemplifies the practical benefits of the One Health approach at the grassroots level.

The CAVE model effectively addresses multiple issues: reducing disease transmission, educating communities, improving livestock productivity, and promoting women's leadership and economic empowerment.

### Hurricane Beryl Intensifies in the Atlantic, Expected to Become Major Storm

Beryl, a Category 1 hurricane, formed farthest east in the Atlantic in June, breaking a 1933 record. It's expected to intensify into a major storm, Category 3 or higher, before hitting Barbados. Hurricane warnings are in place for several Caribbean islands.

The storm's rapid intensification is attributed to record-high ocean heat content. Beryl is the strongest June tropical storm on record in this region.

Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley urged readiness, noting the island's hosting of the Twenty20 World Cup cricket final. Some fans are altering travel plans to avoid the storm.

St. Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves prepared shelters and extended business hours to accommodate storm preparations.

Beryl is the second named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, predicted to be busy. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecasts 17 to 25 named storms, with up to 13 hurricanes and four major ones.

Rain, high surf, and storm surges are expected in affected areas. Caribbean leaders are also monitoring a cluster of thunderstorms following Beryl's path.

Sports fans are now favoring social media clips over live TV broadcasts of the Olympics. This change is detrimental to the International Olympic Committee, which relies on broadcast rights for 60% of its revenue.

TV viewership has declined: 3.05 billion people watched the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, a decrease from 3.6 billion in London 2012. Meanwhile, internet clips have seen a surge: 28 billion views in Tokyo, up from 1.9 billion in London.

Young viewers, such as a Japanese individual in their twenties, opt for highlights instead of live TV. Since 1984, IOC broadcast revenues have increased tenfold, but now they face a potential decline.

Pay-per-view and high rights fees are reducing traditional TV audiences. Free Olympic broadcasts are straining TV channels, resulting in losses.

The 2024 Paris Olympics poses challenges for Japanese broadcasters due to time differences and the yen's depreciation.

TV sports once brought viewers together, but now smartphones are fragmenting the audience. Youth TV sports viewership and participation in sports clubs have decreased.

Olympics organizers are looking at e-sports, but financial interests could further destabilize the Games.
