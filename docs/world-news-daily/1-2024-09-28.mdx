# World News Daily(2024-09-28) : California Apologizes for Slavery and Takes Steps Towards Reparations

## California Apologizes for Slavery and Takes Steps Towards Reparations

California has formally apologized for its role in slavery and its lingering effects on Black Americans. Governor Gavin Newsom signed legislation acknowledging the state's historical complicity in the institution of slavery and its enduring racial disparities.

California's 1849 constitution declared slavery intolerable but lacked explicit laws to criminalize it or protect Black freedom, creating legal ambiguity that enslavers exploited. In 1852, a fugitive slave law was enacted, allowing escaped enslaved people to be arrested and returned to the South.

Despite resistance to cash payments, a UCLA study indicates most Californians support some form of compensation to address anti-Black racism. Newsom approved a $297.9 billion budget, including $12 million for reparations legislation.

The state has also taken steps to improve protections against hair discrimination and increase oversight over banned books in prisons. A new law mandates transparency in the prison book-banning process, requiring the office of the inspector general to review and post the list of banned books.

California leads other states in reparations efforts, with local initiatives like returning Bruce’s Beach to its original Black owners and ongoing demands for reparations in Palm Springs. However, the absence of widespread direct payments to African Americans has frustrated some advocates.

**Key Terms:**
- **Eminent domain:** The power of the government to seize private property for public use, often with compensation.
- **Reparations:** Compensation offered to address past injustices, particularly slavery and its effects.

### Iranian Operatives Charged in Trump Campaign Hack

  alt="Iranian Operatives Charged in Trump Campaign Hack"

The US Justice Department charged three Iranian operatives with hacking Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign. The hackers aimed to undermine Trump’s bid by leaking stolen documents to media outlets. Despite the leaks, major news organizations like Politico, the New York Times, and the Washington Post chose not to publish the sensitive information.

US Attorney General Merrick Garland noted a surge in Iranian cyber activity during this election cycle. Intelligence linked Iran to not only the Trump campaign hack but also an attempted breach of the Biden-Harris campaign. The operation sought to sow discord and influence the election outcome, seen as crucial to Iran’s national security.

Iran also sent unsolicited emails with hacked information to Biden campaign associates, though none responded. The Harris campaign labeled these emails as spam or phishing attempts.

The indictment comes amid escalating tensions between the US and Iran, including suspected Iranian plots to assassinate Trump. US intelligence briefed Trump on these threats, unrelated to previous failed assassination attempts.

### Massive Floods Devastate Six African Countries, Impacting Millions

More than four million people across six African countries—Cameroon, Chad, Guinea, Mali, Niger, and Nigeria—have been hit by severe floods. The disaster, unprecedented in scale, has displaced over 500,000, destroyed 300,000 homes, and claimed over 1,000 lives.

In Maiduguri, Nigeria, residents describe houses swept away, a prison washed out, and streets filled with floating corpses. Saleh Bukar, a local, recounts being roused by neighbors screaming, "Water is flooding everywhere!" Many drowned in their sleep.

Aishatu Ba'agana, a mother of three, lost her newborn to the flood. She hasn't seen her family since. The flood destroyed crucial infrastructure, including a dam that unleashed 540 billion liters of water, collapsing bridges and turning the city into a river.

Canoe trips now cost more than a month's wage. Falmata Muhammed, a mother of three, was charged $50 for a short trip, more than her monthly income. She laments, "After losing almost everything to floods, she was upset that some are making it a big business, using the disaster to make a huge amount of money."

In Niger, over 841,000 people are affected. Harira Adamou, a single mother of six, lost her mud hut in Agadez. She says, "The rooms are destroyed; the walls fell down." Unemployed and widowed, she lives in a temporary shelter, fearing more rain.

Africa, despite contributing little to global greenhouse gas emissions, is highly vulnerable to extreme weather. The cost of adapting to such events in sub-Saharan Africa is estimated at $30-50 billion annually over the next decade. By 2030, up to 118 million Africans could be impacted.

Hurricane Helene, once a 140 mph (225 kph) monster, ravaged Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, and Virginia, resulting in at least 44 fatalities. The storm weakened but continued to flood Tennessee, prompting rescue operations.

In Erwin, Tennessee, the Unicoi County Hospital was inundated; patients were evacuated by raft. Over three million people lost power across Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, and the Carolinas, with additional outages reported in Ohio and Indiana.

Tornadoes spawned by the storm injured four in North Carolina. Atlanta experienced its heaviest rainfall in history—11.2 inches (28.4 cm) over two days.

Helene struck Florida’s Big Bend, a quiet coastal region. It also disrupted Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula and Cuba, cutting power to 200,000 homes.

President Biden approved emergency aid for Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. He and Vice President Harris offered prayers for the victims.

**Explanation:**
- **Post-tropical cyclone:** A storm that loses its tropical characteristics but still carries strong winds and rain.
- **Intubated patients:** Patients who have a tube inserted into their windpipe to help them breathe.

Hanoi's new Metro Line 3, an 8.5-kilometer above-ground stretch connecting Nhon and Cau Giay, has quickly won over commuters. In its first 15 days, over 750,000 passengers rode for free. Regular fares start at 8,000 dong (30 cents), with a day pass at 24,000 dong.

The line, adorned with vibrant Vietnamese imagery, offers a scenic ride akin to a mini-trip. Many riders are students and tech workers, drawn by the universities and companies along the route. Beyond the city center, the line serves high-rise residential areas, promising relief from traffic congestion.

Currently, the line stops short of Hanoi Station, with construction ongoing on a 4-km underground section. Despite this, the line's potential to spur development in outlying areas is clear.

Hanoi Metro's revenue rose 7% in 2023 to 515.2 billion dong, with net profit nearly sextupling to 13.1 billion dong, thanks to strong ridership on Line 2A. With Line 3 now operational, further growth is expected in 2024.

Meanwhile, Ho Chi Minh City's subway, backed by Japan, faces delays due to administrative issues and COVID-19.

### Google Rehires AI Expert Noam Shazeer for $27 Billion After Character.AI Co-Founding

  alt="Google Rehires AI Expert Noam Shazeer for $27 Billion After Character.AI Co-Founding"
/>

Noam Shazeer, a prominent AI researcher, left Google in 2021 due to frustration with the company's cautious approach to deploying AI. He co-founded Character.AI, a startup focused on advanced chatbots. Recently, Google rehired Shazeer for a staggering $27 billion, primarily to secure his expertise and the technology developed at Character.AI.

Shazeer's journey at Google was marked by significant contributions, including the foundational paper "Attention is All You Need," which laid the groundwork for generative AI. His departure stemmed from Google's reluctance to release their AI tools, despite their potential.

Character.AI quickly gained traction, becoming the second most popular AI chat tool in the U.S. behind OpenAI's ChatGPT. However, the startup faced financial pressures and ethical challenges, such as managing inappropriate user interactions.

Google's acquisition of Character.AI's technology and Shazeer's return signify a strategic shift towards more aggressive AI development. Shazeer now leads key projects, including the development of Gemini, Google's most powerful AI system.

This move underscores the high stakes in the AI race, where talent and innovation are valued at unprecedented levels. Shazeer's return is seen as a significant boost for Google's AI ambitions, potentially tipping the scales in their favor.
