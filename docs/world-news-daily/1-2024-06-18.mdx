# World News Daily(2024-06-18) : Nuclear-armed Nations Increase Spending, Deepening Reliance on Nuclear Weapons

## Nuclear-armed Nations Increase Spending, Deepening Reliance on Nuclear Weapons

Nuclear-armed nations, led by the U.S., are escalating their reliance on nuclear weapons, spending a staggering $91.4 billion in 2023. This marks a $10.7 billion increase from 2022, with the U.S. accounting for 80% of this surge. The total U.S. expenditure, $51.5 billion, exceeds the combined spending of all other nuclear states.

China follows at $11.8 billion, with Russia at $8.3 billion. Despite the colossal investment, global security is not enhanced; instead, it is threatened.

SIPRI reports that 2,100 deployed warheads are on high alert, primarily by Russia and the U.S. China now also maintains some warheads in this state. The trend of increasing operational nuclear warheads is alarming and expected to accelerate.

Russia and the U.S. possess nearly 90% of all nuclear weapons. Transparency has waned since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with both nations halting strategic dialogues.

Globally, about 9,585 warheads are in military stockpiles, with 3,904 deployed. The capability to deploy multiple warheads on ballistic missiles is being pursued by India, Pakistan, and North Korea, escalating the potential for rapid deployment and increased threats.

This arms race, reminiscent of the Cold War, underscores a deepening reliance on nuclear deterrence, despite its inherent risks and moral implications.

## Politics

### Social Media's Role in Shaping European Politics

In Cyprus, a YouTuber named Fidias, with no political background, won a European Parliament seat by leveraging his online fame. He campaigned without political stances, promising only authenticity. In Spain, Alvise Pérez, a far-right figure, also secured a seat by railing against immigration and corruption on social media. Both tapped into public disillusionment with traditional politics, using video-based platforms to connect with young voters.

This trend reflects a broader shift where digital subcultures propel unconventional candidates into power, accelerated by platforms like TikTok and Instagram. These tools not only disseminate ideas rapidly but also humanize far-right figures, blurring the lines between entertainment and politics. The success of Fidias and Alvise underscores a growing voter appetite for change, expressed through social media's viral power.

Thailand edges towards legalizing same-sex marriage, poised to be the first in Southeast Asia to do so. The senate is set to approve the legislation, which alters marriage laws to include gender-neutral terms and grants same-sex couples equal rights in adoption and inheritance. If passed, the law will follow Taiwan and Nepal as the third in Asia to recognize marriage equality.

Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin, a vocal supporter, plans to open his residence for celebrations post-vote. Activists anticipate the first weddings by October, despite criticism that the law does not fully address transgender and non-binary rights.

Thailand, known for its LGBTQ+ tolerance, sees overwhelming public support for the bill, marking a significant stride in equal rights despite traditional conservative undercurrents.

In June, the digital landscape of Xiamen experienced a significant transformation with the establishment of Sanzhiyang Group's Xiamen branch, spearheaded by its founder with a billion followers, Xiao Yang Ge. This development signified a strategic initiative to capitalize on Fujian's thriving tea industry, with the goal of creating a national e-commerce hub for premium tea resources.

Concurrently, Xiamen's beauty industry saw a surge on TikTok, with local brands such as Dr. Wen, VC, and Zao Wu Zhe leading in sales, outperforming well-known international brands. These TikTok-native brands concentrate on select SKUs, popular products, and substantial advertising investments, achieving high returns on investment through strategic celebrity endorsements.

Xiamen's e-commerce strategy, known as "technical flow," involves meticulous analysis of TikTok's algorithms to enable precise ad targeting and high profitability, distinguishing it from other TikTok hubs like Yiwu and Guangzhou, which emphasize low pricing and direct factory sales, respectively.

The city's digital capabilities are further enhanced by TikTok's significant presence, including substantial investments and strategic operations. As Xiamen continues to evolve, its dedication to e-commerce is clear, with new policies designed to elevate its position as a leading digital commerce center.

This synergy between local entrepreneurial spirit and global technological influence positions Xiamen as a key player in China's e-commerce landscape, shaping a future where digital innovation and traditional industries seamlessly integrate.

### China Grants Visa-Free Entry to Australia, Boosting Tourism and Economic Ties

China announced on June 17th that Australia will be included in its list of single-entry visa-free countries. This decision has sparked a surge in interest among Australian travelers, with search volumes for China-related travel on Trip.com spiking by over 80% within half an hour of the announcement. The move coincides with a significant increase in flights between the two nations, recording a 220% rise in the number of flights to China from Australia this year.

Australia now stands as the fifth-largest source of inbound tourists to China, experiencing a 155% increase in tourism orders. Popular destinations among Australian visitors include major cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou. The upcoming summer season is marked by a nearly 30% reduction in airfare prices compared to last year.

The visa-free policy is anticipated to boost tourism and economic interactions between China and Australia, benefiting over a million Chinese expatriates residing in Australia. It also underscores the growing economic complementarity between the two countries and a mutual intent to enhance ties in the tourism sector.

This policy change not only streamlines travel for Australians and Chinese expatriates but also facilitates cultural exchange, enabling more individuals to directly experience the dynamic changes in China. The impact on inbound tourism is already noticeable, with significant increases in visitor numbers from countries previously granted similar visa-free access.

German prosecutors have unveiled the country's largest cocaine bust, valued at €2.6 billion, confiscated from multiple container ships. The 35.5 tonnes of cocaine, found in Hamburg, Rotterdam, and Colombia, were hidden within shipments of fruits and vegetables. This operation, triggered by a tip from Colombia, resulted in the arrest of seven individuals from various countries.

The suspects, employing front companies and a sophisticated network of 100 shell companies, masterminded the smuggling of cocaine from Latin America to Europe. Authorities confiscated significant assets during the arrests, including a Porsche and gold bars.

This seizure represents a significant blow to international drug trafficking, disrupting the influx of cocaine into Europe and affecting the operations of global drug kingpins.

### Apple Enhances Podcast Accessibility with Universal Transcripts

Apple's journey to podcast transcripts began in 2018, with the goal of enhancing accessibility for the hearing-impaired. Initially, transcripts were used to provide context for search results, but over seven years, they evolved into a comprehensive feature. Drawing inspiration from Apple Books and Music, transcripts now include time-synced highlighting and adjustable aesthetics. Unlike competitors such as Amazon Music and Spotify, which limit transcripts to select shows, Apple transcribes every new episode and plans to cover its entire podcast library. This commitment to universal accessibility not only benefits its intended audience but also enhances the podcast experience for all listeners. Apple's approach highlights a broader principle: by focusing on the needs of the margins, they improve the product for the masses.

### AI Technology Revolutionizes Video Soundscapes with Video-to-Audio (V2A)

The Generative Media team has developed a groundbreaking technology called Video-to-Audio (V2A), which synchronizes sound with video using video pixels and text prompts. This innovation allows for the creation of rich soundscapes that match the on-screen action, transforming silent videos into immersive audiovisual experiences.

V2A pairs with video generation models like Veo to enhance videos with dramatic scores, realistic sound effects, and dialogue. It can also breathe new life into archival material and silent films, expanding creative possibilities.

The system uses a diffusion-based approach for audio generation, which iteratively refines audio from random noise, guided by visual input and prompts. This method ensures realistic and synchronized audio output.

However, challenges remain, such as maintaining audio quality with video artifacts and improving lip synchronization in videos with speech. The team is actively researching these areas to refine the technology.

**Personal Insight:**

The advent of V2A marks a significant leap in the integration of AI with creative arts. Its potential to harmonize visuals with tailored audio not only enhances storytelling but also democratizes the filmmaking process, making sophisticated audiovisual production accessible to a broader audience. The ongoing research to refine lip synchronization and audio quality promises a future where AI-generated content could rival traditional filmmaking in authenticity and impact.

### NFL Faces Class-Action Lawsuit Over 'Sunday Ticket' Pricing and Distribution

A class-action lawsuit against the NFL challenges the "Sunday Ticket" pricing and distribution. Subscribers argue that the league violated antitrust laws by inflating prices and restricting the package to a single satellite provider. The NFL defends its actions under an antitrust exemption for broadcasting, although the plaintiffs assert this exemption only pertains to over-the-air broadcasts.

Initially dismissed, the case was later reinstated by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. It now encompasses over 2.4 million residential subscribers and 48,000 businesses that purchased the package between 2011 and 2023. The NFL could face up to $21 billion in potential damages if found liable.

This legal battle highlights the NFL's vulnerability in court, especially in Los Angeles, where antitrust issues have traditionally not been in the league's favor. The outcome of this case could significantly influence how other major sports leagues manage their out-of-market packages, potentially altering the dynamics of sports broadcasting rights.

Wesley Wang, a 19-year-old Harvard student, has made history as the youngest director to break into Hollywood. His YouTube short, "nothing, except everything," garnered over 600 million views and caught the attention of TriStar Pictures, which acquired the rights to adapt it into a feature film. A former national chess champion, Wang financed his project through crowdfunding and extensive networking. His success challenges the idea that age is a barrier in filmmaking, echoing the spirit of Orson Welles, who once credited his own breakthrough to an "ignorance" of the impossible.

Wang's journey points to a future where YouTube and Hollywood merge, using digital platforms to uncover new talent and stories. This convergence is not new; many acclaimed directors started in non-traditional mediums. As Hollywood looks for adaptable intellectual properties (IP), platforms like YouTube provide a rich environment for narratives that connect with global audiences.

Wang's story underscores the impact of youthful vision and the changing landscape of film production, where digital content creators can break through boundaries and reshape industry standards.
