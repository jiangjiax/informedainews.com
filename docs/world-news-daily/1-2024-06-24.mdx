### New Study Reveals High Lead Levels in US Residential Soil

New research unveils a startling reality: 25% of American homes have soil with lead levels surpassing the EPA's new 200 ppm safety threshold, reduced from 400 ppm. This translates to approximately 29 million homes at risk. The cost of remediation through traditional excavation methods could skyrocket to $1 trillion, highlighting the issue's enormity and financial burden.

Nearly 40% of households encounter multiple lead exposure sources, prompting the EPA to establish a more stringent 100 ppm guideline for these instances. Alarmingly, 40% of homes exceed this limit, impacting nearly 50 million residences.

Lead, a toxic metal, accumulates in the body, posing significant health risks, especially for children. Historically, low-income and minority communities have disproportionately suffered from lead exposure due to discriminatory practices such as redlining.

Remediation is expensive and time-consuming, typically involving excavation and disposal. A faster, more affordable alternative is "capping"—overlaying contaminated soil with clean material. Although less formal, this method provides immediate protection and is viable for homeowners.

The scale of lead contamination is daunting yet solvable. Raising awareness and taking swift action are crucial to mitigating this widespread health hazard.
