### Moon Cave Discovery Could Be Future Human Habitat

Scientists discovered a cave on the Moon. It is deep, possibly 100 meters, and an excellent location for a human base, offering protection from radiation and extreme temperatures.

The cave features a skylight, vertical walls, and a sloping floor, formed by lava long ago, similar to volcanic caves on Earth.

Researchers located it using radar and believe there are more such caves. They require additional technology, such as ground-penetrating radar, for comprehensive exploration.

This discovery aids in understanding the Moon's history, as the rocks inside the cave are less damaged, providing a clear geological record.

It may also assist in exploring Mars's caves, potentially revealing signs of life, if any existed.

The research has been published in Nature Astronomy.

Scientists have developed a new tracking device, the "hair-on-prickle" label, to monitor polar bears. This method is less invasive than traditional collars and can track subadults and adult male bears, groups previously hard to study.

The device sticks to the bear's fur and confirms that these bears spend most of their time on land, conserving energy until the ice returns. This technology fills a gap left by collars, which don't fit adult males or rapidly growing subadults.

The new trackers, tested on wild bears, showed promise. The SeaTrkr label, using GPS/Iridium technology, lasted an average of 58 days and provided more accurate data. This method could be crucial for understanding bear behavior and managing human-bear interactions.

This innovation, a result of collaboration between York University, 3M, and Polar Bears International, marks a significant step in wildlife management and conservation. It's especially vital as climate change accelerates, affecting bear habitats and interactions with humans.

TikTok and Kantar predict a doubling of "Korean Wave" revenue by 2030, reaching $1.43 trillion. Currently at $760 billion, this surge is driven by viral content on platforms like TikTok, particularly in the U.S. and Southeast Asia.

Korean culture, encompassing K-pop and dramas, is a significant attraction. TikTok plays a crucial role, not only as a fan hub but also as a sales catalyst for Korean products such as food and cosmetics. A video by Cardi B boosted instant noodle sales, highlighting the platform's market influence.

Although TikTok has a global impact, local Korean users favor YouTube and Instagram. However, TikTok is dominant in introducing Korean culture to new markets, with 80% of users in the U.S. and Southeast Asia discovering it there.

TikTok's expansion into e-commerce, especially with Korean products, is well-timed. Over half of TikTok users have purchased Korean items directly through the app. The music, beauty, and food sectors are particularly robust, with continued growth anticipated.

The report highlights TikTok's role in globalizing Korean culture, enhancing its soft power and economic impact. Southeast Asia is emerging as a pivotal gateway for this cultural and commercial expansion.

Land sales in China dropped 35% in the first half of 2024. Residential land sales fell 42% in value, totaling 669.4 billion yuan. This marks a significant shift, with residential land transactions dropping from 82% to 64% of total land sales since 2011.

Local governments heavily rely on land auction revenue for expenses like education and affordable housing. The decline forces them to depend more on central government transfer payments. These payments, initially a stopgap, are now a crucial part of local finances.

Guangdong, Ningxia, and Tianjin saw the steepest falls in land revenue, dropping 64%, 62%, and 60% respectively. State-owned enterprises now dominate land auctions, accounting for 80% of acquisitions.

Developers are retreating from third- and fourth-tier cities, focusing on first- and second-tier cities. However, even these markets are losing appeal. Beijing and Shanghai saw land revenue declines of 16% and 19%. Guangzhou sold only four residential lots.

The real estate crisis is deepening. Top developers avoided buying land in 12 provinces in the first half of 2024. The shift in land sales dynamics reflects broader economic challenges and changes in the real estate market.
