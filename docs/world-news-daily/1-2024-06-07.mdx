SpaceX's colossal Starship rocket, the largest ever built, soared into the sky from Texas on its fourth test flight. Despite technical glitches in the live feed, the mission was a resounding success. The rocket, equipped with a new heat shield deployment mechanism, navigated through intense atmospheric re-entry heat flawlessly. Its super-heavy booster stage splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico, marking a significant milestone.

Starship itself, after a 66-minute journey, gently touched down in the Indian Ocean, despite some thermal tiles being lost and a flap damaged. This soft landing, a critical test for future space missions, was achieved despite the challenges.

The test aimed to scrutinize Starship's resilience during the most brutal part of atmospheric re-entry, a phase crucial for any spacecraft aiming to return from space safely.

This successful test not only advances SpaceX's ambitious space exploration goals but also pushes the boundaries of what is technologically feasible, paving the way for future missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.

### Billions Awarded to Investors in Climate Law Disputes

  alt="Billions Awarded to Investors in Climate Law Disputes"
/>

Over $100 billion has been awarded to private investors through investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) courts, a system that allows corporations to sue governments for decisions impacting their profits. This often secretive arbitration has primarily benefited fossil fuel companies, with $80.21 billion awarded since 1998.

ISDS, which is embedded in many international investment agreements, enables foreign investors to sue states over public measures such as environmental regulations that affect their expected profits. Unlike national courts, ISDS tribunals allow investors to influence the composition of the panels, raising concerns about bias and conflicts of interest.

This mechanism has impeded necessary climate action, diverting public funds to corporations instead of using them for climate reparations. Criticized for its impact on countries in the global south, the system is viewed as a modern form of colonial-era protectionism, ensuring that corporate interests take precedence over environmental and social regulations.

The data underscores an urgent need for reform, as ISDS continues to empower corporations against climate laws, threatening governments from implementing popular climate measures.

In Tokyo, a new generation of Chinese democracy seekers gathers, echoing the historical ties between the two nations. The city, once the cradle of China's 1911 Revolution, now hosts Chinese residents advocating for democracy in mainland China and Hong Kong. The influx of Chinese migrants to Japan, seeking refuge from China's surveillance society and economic stagnation, is on the rise. Many bring wealth, investing in Japanese real estate for stability. Tokyo's significance in Chinese revolutionary history is highlighted by the formation of the Tongmenghui in 1905, a pivotal moment in China's path to revolution. Despite the Chinese Communist Party's reluctance to acknowledge Tokyo's role in history, the legacy of Chinese revolutionaries like Sun Yat-sen lives on in the city. A recent memorial in Tokyo commemorated the 35th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown, honoring the victims of the 1989 tragedy.

### 「英」To Restrict Migrants, Biden Leans on Trump’s Favorite Immigration Law

President Biden, confronted with a historic surge in migrants, has invoked a provision of the asylum law previously favored by Trump to temporarily halt asylum at the southern border. This action suspends the longstanding right of migrants to seek protection upon setting foot on U.S. soil. Biden cited a global migrant crisis as justification, arguing that securing the border is imperative to manage the influx.

This policy represents a significant reversal for Biden and the Democratic Party, traditionally advocates for immigrant rights. Critics contend that Biden is adopting Trump's restrictive tactics, even utilizing the same legal clause Trump used for his contentious Muslim travel ban. Heidi Altman of the National Immigrant Justice Center cautions that this shift threatens U.S. values and commitments.

Despite past Democratic criticisms of Trump's border policies, the political landscape has shifted with rising migrant numbers straining resources in border communities and beyond. Biden, perceiving public support for stricter immigration controls, has aligned with this sentiment, aiming to alleviate pressure on cities grappling with the migrant influx.

The new measures, however, are controversial. They include a five-year ban on entry for migrants caught illegally entering during the asylum suspension, a policy long opposed by liberals. Biden defends his approach, differentiating it from Trump's more extreme measures such as family separations, and reaffirming his commitment to humane immigration policies.

This policy shift reflects a pragmatic adjustment in response to a complex, evolving immigration crisis, balancing humanitarian concerns with practical governance challenges.

Tokyo DisneySea has unveiled its new Fantasy Springs area, attracting a surge of foreign visitors. Anticipating a record 14% of guests from abroad, the park offers attractions themed around "Frozen," "Tangled," and "Peter Pan." The adjacent Fantasy Springs Hotel, featuring luxury rooms from $1,920 per night, is fully booked for months.

Chiba Governor Toshihito Kumagai expects tourism growth, while Tokyo Disney operator Oriental Land celebrates its highest revenue, with foreign visitors making up 12.7% of all park-goers. The Japan National Tourism Organization reports a 72.1% increase in visitors to Japan, benefiting from the weak yen.

The $2.05 billion expansion is part of a broader trend where entertainment companies capitalize on their intellectual property through theme parks. Competitors like Sony and Toei Animation are also expanding their theme park offerings, reflecting a global shift towards immersive entertainment experiences.

Urayasu City, home to Tokyo Disney Resort, is considering an accommodation tax to manage the influx of visitors and enhance local infrastructure. This tax would apply to hotels and other lodging facilities, which frequently host more guests than the city's resident population.

  alt="DJI's Affordable Driver Assistance Tech Set to Transform Automotive Industry"
/>

DJI Automotive, a spin-off from the drone giant DJI, is revolutionizing the affordability of driver assistance technology in cars. Leveraging drone technology, they offer Level 2 autonomy at a cost of just 5,000 yuan per vehicle, making it viable even in cars priced around 100,000 yuan. This starkly contrasts with competitors like Huawei, whose systems are typically found in more expensive models.

At least 20 new models this year will feature DJI's technology, which utilizes cameras and inexpensive semiconductors instead of costly lidar and radar systems. Drawing from DJI's Phantom 4 drone technology, this approach enables vehicles to self-navigate and park autonomously, primarily on highways and familiar roads.

The appeal of DJI Automotive's technology lies in its affordability, potentially accelerating the adoption of driver assistance systems in China, a market expected to quadruple by 2025. As China aims for widespread adoption of such technologies by 2030, DJI's strategy could significantly influence the automotive landscape, making advanced driving features accessible to a broader consumer base.

Level 2 autonomy refers to vehicles that can control both steering and acceleration/deceleration under certain conditions, requiring the driver to remain engaged and ready to take control. Lidar, or Light Detection and Ranging, is a sensing method used to examine the surrounding environment by measuring the distance to a target using laser light.

### The Enduring Shift to Remote Work: Impacts and Implications

  alt="The Enduring Shift to Remote Work: Impacts and Implications"
/>

Remote work, once a rarity, surged during the pandemic and has since stabilized at a significant level—about 25% of workdays. This shift is not temporary; it's a lasting change in the labor market.

Why? Remote work is profitable for companies, reducing turnover and office costs. Employees value it highly, equating it to an 8% pay raise. Hybrid work, a blend of remote and in-office, is particularly popular.

Despite some return-to-office mandates, these are exceptions. The traditional five-day office week is fading, especially for roles that can be done remotely. Companies now recruit nationwide, potentially lowering wages in high cost-of-living areas.

Critics argue remote work hampers oversight and mentoring, but studies show it doesn't harm productivity. In fact, it benefits society by reducing commuting pollution and allowing more family time.

Remote work is a triple win: good for employees, companies, and society. It's hard to find a more beneficial change in modern work practices.

  alt="Saudi Arabia Faces Forced Labor Allegations Ahead of 2034 World Cup Bid"
/>

Saudi Arabia, the likely host of the 2034 World Cup, is facing allegations of forced labor among its migrant workforce. A complaint filed with the UN's International Labour Organization (ILO) alleges widespread labor rights violations, including unpaid wages, passport confiscation, and debt bondage. The Building and Wood Workers’ International (BWI), a trade union representing about 12 million workers, describes these practices as "an epidemic of abuses," indicative of forced labor, a modern form of slavery.

The BWI is urging the ILO to investigate these claims, supported by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and FairSquare. This complaint comes just months before FIFA's decision on the World Cup host. FIFA's bidding rules mandate that host countries must respect internationally recognized human rights, which could complicate Saudi Arabia's bid.

Similar to Qatar, Saudi Arabia heavily relies on migrant workers, predominantly from South Asia and Africa. The workforce could significantly expand due to World Cup-related construction projects. Despite recent labor reforms, a BWI survey of 193 migrant workers indicates ongoing abuses, such as denial of access to personal documents and restrictions on job mobility.

This complaint could pose a significant challenge to FIFA's decision, necessitating a critical examination of labor practices in potential host countries. FIFA's response will test its commitment to human rights and labor standards, potentially influencing labor reforms in Saudi Arabia and beyond.

New research on ancient zircon crystals from Australia reveals that Earth had fresh water and dry land 4 billion years ago, 5 billion years earlier than previously thought. Scientists at Curtin University analyzed these zircon crystals from Jack Hills, Western Australia, which are the oldest known terrestrial minerals. Zircon, nicknamed the "Time Lord," is highly resistant to erosion and transformation, making it a reliable historical record.

The team dated about 1,000 zircon grains, finding that 10% were over 4 billion years old. By measuring the ratio of heavy to light oxygen isotopes within these crystals, they detected a unique light oxygen signature, indicating the presence of fresh water. This discovery suggests that the hydrological cycle, crucial for sustaining life, began at least 4 billion years ago.

This evidence challenges previous theories that Earth was entirely covered by oceans 3 to 4 billion years ago. The findings not only shed light on Earth's early history but also suggest that land and fresh water might have facilitated the rapid emergence of life within 6 billion years of Earth's formation.

### Disney and DeSantis Reach Agreement, Disney to Invest $17B in Florida Parks

Disney and DeSantis' appointees, following a legal dispute, have reached an agreement. Disney intends to invest $17 billion in Florida parks, potentially adding a fifth theme park and expanding accommodations and retail spaces. In exchange, Disney must support local infrastructure and housing, and prioritize Florida-based contractors.

The conflict arose when DeSantis, unhappy with Disney's opposition to Florida's "Don't Say Gay" law, assumed control of the district overseeing Disney World. Disney filed a lawsuit, claiming a violation of its free speech rights. The settlement halts this legal confrontation, enabling both parties to concentrate on development.

This agreement marks a strategic shift, balancing Disney's expansion goals with local community needs, potentially setting a precedent for corporate-government relations in development projects.
