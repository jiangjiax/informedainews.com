The Biden administration has announced that it will provide $4.3 billion to local governments for climate projects. These funds will support 25 projects across 30 states, aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting the transition to clean energy. Projects include the construction of solar and wind farms, as well as the deployment of electric vehicle charging infrastructure. By 2050, these projects are expected to reduce approximately 971 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, equivalent to eliminating the pollution of 5 million American households annually.

Pennsylvania has received $396 million to launch the RISE PA initiative, which aims to reduce carbon emissions from industrial facilities, create jobs, and invest in the energy sector. This funding comes from the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest investment in climate and clean energy in the United States. Additionally, the Biden administration's Justice40 Initiative ensures that at least 40% of the investments go to disadvantaged communities.

Despite the United States remaining the world's largest producer of oil and natural gas, the Biden administration has pledged to reduce carbon emissions by at least 50% by 2030, in line with the Paris Agreement. Former President Trump had stated that if re-elected, he would attempt to withdraw the United States from the agreement.

### Biden Withdraws, Endorses Harris: Political Chaos Ensues

Biden exits race, backs Harris. Chaos ensues.

President Joe Biden withdraws from the 2024 election, endorses Kamala Harris. He remains in office until January. Republicans demand his immediate resignation.

Harris isn't a shoo-in. Delegates at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) determine the nominee. Biden's endorsement enhances her prospects. No formidable challengers emerge.

Potential candidates like Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer opt out of running. Others unite behind Harris. The DNC confronts an open convention, a rare occurrence.

Delegates cast their votes. If no majority is reached, superdelegates participate in the ballot. 1,976 votes are needed to secure the nomination.

Harris's choice for VP is less formal. Potential selections include Shapiro, Pritzker, and Kelly.

Biden's $100 million campaign funds may transfer to Harris. Republicans threaten legal action. The fate of the funds remains uncertain if a different nominee arises.

Insights:
This political chess game tests party unity and strategy. Biden's move, unprecedented since 1968, reshapes the election landscape. Harris must navigate a tightrope, balancing ambition and loyalty. The DNC's decision process underscores the complexities of democracy. Financial challenges add another layer of uncertainty. The outcome will define the Democratic Party's future and America's political direction.

New HIV infections have shifted outside sub-Saharan Africa. UNAids reports a 56% drop in Africa since 2010. Global infections are down 39%.

Infections are rising in eastern Europe, central Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and North Africa. Winnie Byanyima, UNAids director, warns of a human rights backlash. Funding cuts and debt hinder care.

New drugs, taken every few months, could be exclusive to richer nations. The UN's goal to end AIDS by 2030 is lagging. 39.9 million people live with HIV globally. There were 1.3 million new infections and 630,000 AIDS-related deaths in 2023.

Dr. Sharon Lewin, International AIDS Society president, highlights successes in poor regions but notes challenges outside Africa. Infections are concentrated in marginalized groups facing discrimination.

Byanyima stresses the need for decriminalization and fighting stigma. Young women in sub-Saharan Africa remain vulnerable. Only 50% of HIV-positive individuals in eastern Europe, central Asia, and the Middle East take antiretroviral drugs.

Sub-Saharan Africa lacks treatment for nearly half its HIV-positive population, especially children. Byanyima urges immediate global sharing of long-acting drugs and debt restructuring to boost health spending.

### AI-Generated Child Abuse Material Surges, Challenging Tech Regulation

Generative AI is fueling a surge in online child sexual abuse materials (CSAM). The UK's Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) reports a 17% increase in AI-altered CSAM since fall 2023. Deepfake content, using real victims' imagery, is rampant. One forum shared 3,512 explicit images and videos in 30 days, mostly of young girls. Offenders share advice and AI models fed by real images.

IWF CEO Susie Hargreaves warns, "Without proper controls, generative AI tools provide a playground for online predators." The technology is advancing rapidly, creating more lifelike synthetic videos. Of 12,000 AI-generated images on a dark web forum, 90% were realistic enough to be assessed as real CSAM.

Apple faces allegations of underreporting CSAM shared via its products. The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) claims Apple was implicated in 337 offenses in England and Wales alone between April 2022 and March 2023, while reporting only 267 cases worldwide to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC).

Google reported over 1.47 million CSAM cases to NCMEC in 2023. Facebook removed 14.4 million pieces of child sexual exploitation content between January and March this year. Despite these efforts, the battle against online child exploitation intensifies with the misuse of generative AI.

  alt="AI Method Accelerates Material Thermal Property Predictions"
/>

MIT researchers have developed a new AI method to predict material thermal properties, specifically how heat moves via phonons, subatomic particles. This prediction is crucial for designing efficient power systems, as 70% of global energy ends up as waste heat.

The challenge lies in predicting the phonon dispersion relation, a complex measure of energy and momentum in crystal structures. Traditional methods, whether AI or non-AI, are slow and computationally intensive.

The new method, a Virtual Node Graph Neural Network (VGNN), introduces flexible virtual nodes to represent phonons. This approach speeds up predictions by up to 1,000 times compared to other AI methods and 1 million times faster than non-AI methods, all while maintaining accuracy.

VGNN simplifies complex calculations by using virtual nodes, allowing quick estimation of phonon dispersion relations. This efficiency enables broader searches for materials with specific thermal properties, such as superior heat storage or superconductivity.

The method isn't limited to thermal properties; it can also predict challenging properties like optics and magnetism. Future improvements aim to enhance virtual nodes' sensitivity to subtle structural changes.

Overall, VGNN represents a significant advancement in material science, offering a faster, more efficient way to predict and utilize material properties.

Yan Lianke, a literary giant from China, explores the authenticity of literature in his work "The Faith of Fiction." He believes that authenticity is the core belief of fiction, transcending language and structure, and is a natural pursuit for writers. Yan Lianke dislikes discussing his personal writing experiences and prefers to gain insights from reading and incorporate them into his creations.

He emphasizes that literary theory and creation largely operate independently, but he wrote "The Faith of Fiction" primarily for self-inspiration and clarification. Yan Lianke's works are deeply influenced by his childhood experiences, particularly his fears of hunger, revolution, and death, which form the foundation of his writings.

Regarding contemporary Chinese literature, Yan Lianke believes that it has not yet produced classics that transcend individual life experiences. Alongside writers like Can Xue, who are both considered strong contenders for the Nobel Prize, they maintain a distance from the Chinese literary scene, embracing or distancing themselves from reality in different ways.

Yan Lianke proposes that dreams, as a creative technique, should not be used as a tool to escape reality but rather as a means to understand it. His works, such as "The Chronicles of Liaozhai," offer a modern interpretation of classical literature, exploring the spiritual aspects of non-experiential authenticity.

Asahi Group, Japan’s brewing giant, continues to grow in Australia. Five years after acquiring Carlton & United Breweries, the focus has shifted to soft drinks. CUB, Australia’s largest beer maker, operates six breweries and employs 1,700 people. Melbourne’s Abbotsford brewery, a CUB asset, produces 300 million liters annually.

Asahi’s 2019 acquisition of CUB from Anheuser-Busch InBev cost 16 billion Australian dollars. By 2023, Asahi held a 59% share of Australia’s mid-priced beer market. Following the acquisition, Asahi enhanced employee morale by promising no future sales and investing in long-term growth.

Asahi’s Oceania region, including Australia, contributed 24% of revenue and 40% of core operating profit in 2023. Marketing strategies, such as sports sponsorships, and environmental initiatives, including plastic bottle recycling, strengthen its presence.

Australia’s population growth, in contrast to Japan’s decline, fuels economic optimism. Asahi is pivoting to non-alcoholic and low-alcohol drinks, aiming for a 20% sales mix by 2030. Recent acquisitions include Never Never Distilling, a luxury gin maker.

Asahi’s strategy involves leveraging synergies, avoiding antitrust issues, and exploring unique acquisitions. Financial stability, despite no imminent major deals, positions Asahi for future growth.
