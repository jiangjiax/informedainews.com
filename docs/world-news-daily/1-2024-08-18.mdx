Extreme misogyny, a new form of terrorism, is being targeted under UK plans. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is reviewing counter-terrorism strategies with a focus on violence against women and girls.

Teachers are required to report suspected extreme misogyny to Prevent, the UK's counter-terrorism program. Cooper highlights the increase in online and street extremism and the urgency for action.

The review seeks to identify policy gaps and effective disruption methods, with an expected completion in the autumn. A new counter-extremism strategy will follow.

The "Incel" subculture, which is misogynistic online, blames women for their lack of sexual opportunities. Deputy Chief Constable Maggie Blyth links online influencers like Andrew Tate to radicalization. Tate is facing trial in Romania on allegations of rape and human trafficking.

Prevent workers have observed an increase in school referrals influenced by Tate's teachings. His toxic misogyny closely aligns with incel ideology.

### Adapting to AI: The Future of Human-Machine Collaboration

The world is changing rapidly due to smart technologies. Humans must adapt or risk obsolescence. The rise of technosubjects—machines capable of self-development—blurs the line between man and machine. This cyborgization could lead to a split between natural and augmented humans, mirroring conflicts seen in games like Deus Ex and Cyberpunk.

New social groups, like "centaurs"—human-robot teams—are forming. These unions are more efficient than traditional groups. The Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) are merging with the Internet of People, creating an Internet of Everything. This integration transforms the physical and digital worlds into a unified space.

Virtual reality and blockchain technology are pushing society towards total decentralization. Physical presence will become obsolete as virtual interactions become more immersive. Offices, theaters, and stadiums may disappear as robots take over jobs and blockchain ensures transparent interactions.

To survive, humans must rethink education and governance. Adaptation is no longer optional; it's essential for preserving our place as the smartest species on the planet.

  alt="Decoding Deep Earth's Mysteries: The PKP Seismic Signals"
/>

Earth scientists have long puzzled over PKP precursors, seismic signals that precede main quake waves. New research links these signals to ultra-low-velocity zones deep beneath North America and the western Pacific. These zones, where seismic waves slow significantly, might be tied to major geological features like hotspot volcanoes.

Michael Thorne, a geophysicist at the University of Utah, led the study. His team used advanced seismic techniques to trace PKP precursors back to the core-mantle boundary, about 2900 kilometers below Earth's surface. They believe these ultra-low-velocity zones form when subducting tectonic plates hit the core-mantle boundary.

Thorne speculates that these zones could be the source of mantle plumes, which drive volcanic activity at sites like Yellowstone, Hawaii, and Iceland. His findings suggest these zones are more widespread than previously thought, potentially influencing geological processes globally.

The study, published in AGU Advances, marks a significant step in understanding Earth's deep dynamics. It highlights the power of seismic waves in revealing the planet's hidden structures and processes.

New research in the Journal of Anthropological Archaeology explores ancient rock art in Colombia's Amazon, dating back 12,500 years. These paintings, found at Cerro Azul, depict a variety of animals and mythological transformations, offering insights into early Amazonian diets, myths, and environmental interactions.

The art reveals a complex relationship between humans and animals, where creatures were not only food sources but also revered beings linked to the supernatural. This duality is evident in the paintings, which include scenes of hunting and fishing alongside mythical transformations.

Archaeologists combined analysis of animal remains from nearby digs with the art. The remains showed a diverse diet, including fish, mammals, reptiles, yet the art did not mirror this directly. This suggests selective representation, possibly influenced by cultural or spiritual significance.

The study highlights the intricate knowledge and utilization of diverse ecosystems by ancient Amazonians, from aquatic to terrestrial habitats. It also touches on the cosmological aspects of their lives, such as taboos and interactions with the supernatural.

This research, facilitated by recent peace in the region, opens a window into the deep history and rich mythology of the Amazon, revealing how early humans perceived their world and their place within it.

Japan's anime and content exports are nearly on par with steel and semiconductors. This growth offers a chance to bolster the economy. U.S. sprinter Noah Lyles celebrated his Olympic win with a "Dragon Ball" pose, highlighting anime's global reach.

Japan's digital trade deficit hit 5.5 trillion yen in 2023, mainly from cloud services and internet ads. The content industry could reverse this, according to a Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry official.

The government's 2024 economic white paper supports this view, emphasizing the need to capitalize on strengths like content. Anime series like "Jujutsu Kaisen" and "Attack on Titan" top global charts. However, Japan lags in live-action films and mobile games compared to South Korea and China.

Japanese content providers have been cautious, focusing on the domestic market. This limits their global competitiveness. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's new economic agenda includes boosting content industry exports.

The Cool Japan Fund, launched in 2013, has struggled, losing nearly 40 billion yen. Developing effective policies for the content industry requires extensive trial and error.

Japan's content exports are close to 4.7 trillion yen, nearing semiconductor and steel exports. A successful content industry strategy could surpass auto exports, which stand at 13 trillion yen.

The research team at the University of California, Davis, has developed a new type of brain-computer interface technology that can convert brain signals into speech with 97% accuracy. This technology brings hope to patients with language disorders such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). In the study, a 45-year-old ALS patient, Kathy Harell, successfully expressed her thoughts through a device implanted in her brain.

The technology implants sensors in the brain to interpret brain signals during speech, converts them into text, and then has the computer read it out. Harell conducted 84 experiments over 32 weeks, engaging in over 248 hours of autonomous conversations through the system. The system's initial accuracy was 99.6%, stabilizing at 97.5% after training.

The research team plans to apply the technology to more patients in the coming years and expand its capabilities, such as adding intonation and singing abilities. Despite challenges such as portability and infection risks, the high precision of this technology offers hope to those who have lost their language abilities.

Gaza's first polio case in 25 years has emerged in a 10-month-old child. The UN has called for war pauses to vaccinate over 640,000 children. Polio, which spreads through sewage, causes paralysis and can be fatal, mainly affecting kids under five.

The UN plans two seven-day vaccination drives starting late August. These require ceasefires to ensure safe access to health facilities. Over 1.6 million vaccine doses are set to arrive via Israel's Ben Gurion airport.

The re-emergence of polio threatens neighboring countries. A ceasefire is crucial for regional public health security. The Gaza health ministry and UN agencies aim to administer two drops of the novel oral polio vaccine type 2 to children under ten.

The war, ongoing for 11 months, escalated after Hamas's attack on Israel in October, leading to thousands of deaths. Israel's retaliatory campaign in Gaza has claimed over 40,000 lives.

### Deep Sleep Resets the Hippocampus, Facilitating Continuous Learning

  alt="Deep Sleep Resets the Hippocampus, Facilitating Continuous Learning"
/>

Good sleep not only restores energy but also resets memory. Research from Cornell University has found that learning activates hippocampal neurons, and during sleep, these neurons repeat their activity patterns to reinforce memory. Memories are stored in the cortex.

The question is, how does the brain continue to learn without exhausting its neurons? A new study in the journal _Science_ reveals that during deep sleep, certain parts of the hippocampus fall silent, allowing neurons to reset. The hippocampus is divided into CA1, CA2, and CA3 regions, with CA1 and CA3 involved in encoding spatial and temporal memories, and CA2 regulating memory reset.

Through experiments with mice, the study found that during sleep, neurons in the CA1 and CA3 regions replay learning patterns, while the CA2 region quiets these areas, enabling memory reset. The brain has two types of interneurons that regulate parallel circuits: one type controls memory, and the other allows for memory reset.

This discovery not only aids in enhancing memory but may also explore methods to eliminate negative memories and treat conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder. Memory is a dynamic process, and sleep not only repairs memories but also resets the brain, allowing it to continue functioning when awake.

### Tiny Creatures Steal Genes to Fight Infections

  alt="Tiny Creatures Steal Genes to Fight Infections"

Bdelloid rotifers, tiny freshwater creatures, steal genes from bacteria to make antibiotics. This discovery by researchers at Oxford, Stirling, and Woods Hole Marine Bio Lab could lead to safer drugs against resistant infections.

These rotifers, smaller than a hair's width, have heads, mouths, guts, muscles, and nerves. When infected by fungi, they activate stolen genes to produce antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents.

Chris Wilson, a lead researcher, was surprised to find these genes, typically thought beyond animal capability, actually crafting antibiotic recipes.

Rotifers have been borrowing DNA from their environment for millions of years. This study shows they use these genes to fight disease, a strategy unique among animals.

David Mark Welch suggests rotifers might evolve new antibiotics less toxic to animals, including humans.

Antibiotics, crucial for modern medicine, are mostly natural products of wild fungi and bacteria. Rotifers might be doing the same, hinting at new drug possibilities.

Reuben Nowell notes the unique DNA changes in these stolen genes might lead to new chemical compounds, exciting for future drug development.

Irina Arkhipova proposes the next step should be identifying these compounds and understanding their synthesis conditions.

The challenge in drug development is many natural antibiotics are toxic to animals. If rotifers can safely produce these chemicals, it might pave the way for safer human medicines.

Tim Barraclough links this gene borrowing to rotifers' unique reproduction: they are all female, reproducing without males. This asexual reproduction might explain their extensive gene borrowing, crucial for survival.

Reuben Nowell concludes these stolen genes, some from plants, offer insights into gene mobility across species, a growing field of study.
