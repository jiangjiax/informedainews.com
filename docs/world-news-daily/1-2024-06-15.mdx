China, Russia, and North Korea may allow ships to navigate the Tumen River into the Sea of Japan, raising security concerns for Tokyo. Currently, Chinese vessels face restrictions due to a bridge and permissions needed from Russia and North Korea. Recent talks between Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin signal a potential shift in allowing access. Russia's reliance on China for trade, amid sanctions, has led to a warming relationship. China aims to widen the river and demolish the bridge for easier transport and economic exchanges. However, this move could impact security, with potential implications for Japan's coast guard activities near disputed territories. Joint military drills and patrols between China and Russia further complicate the situation in the Sea of Japan.

### Trump Proposes Tariff-Based Revenue System: A Shift in US Economic Policy

  alt="Trump Proposes Tariff-Based Revenue System: A Shift in US Economic Policy"
/>

Trump proposes a "full tariff" system to replace income tax, aiming to protect domestic industries and reduce corporate taxes. This initiative, if enacted, would overturn more than a century of economic policy that has promoted free trade and progressive taxation. Critics contend that it would place a heavier burden on middle and lower-income Americans while enriching the wealthy.

Under Trump's plan, a 10% tariff would be levied on all imported goods, potentially impacting over $3 trillion in annual imports. This could disrupt global supply chains and lead to higher consumer prices, intensifying inflation. At the same time, Trump advocates for reducing the corporate tax rate to 20%, which would further benefit large corporations.

Despite previous controversies, Trump's re-emergence on Capitol Hill indicates a political reconciliation, with many Republicans now endorsing his policies. His lead in polls against Biden reflects a significant shift in public opinion, which could reshape U.S. fiscal and trade policies.

This policy shift harkens back to 19th-century protectionism, representing a sharp divergence from recent economic standards. The ramifications are extensive, affecting income distribution, international trade dynamics, and domestic economic stability.

### Study Reveals Sleep Deprivation's Impact on Memory Formation

<img

  alt="Study Reveals Sleep Deprivation's Impact on Memory Formation"
/>

Sleep loss weakens memory signals in the brain, as revealed by a study in *Nature*. Even after recovery sleep, the damage isn't fully repaired. The study, which involved mice, demonstrated that sleep deprivation disrupts "sharp wave ripples"—synchronized neural patterns in the hippocampus essential for memory formation. These ripples, which occur both during wakefulness and sleep, are crucial for transferring knowledge into long-term memory.

Researchers noted that although sleep-deprived mice exhibited similar ripple frequencies to well-rested ones, their ripples were weaker and less organized, thus impairing memory consolidation. This implies that intense cramming before exams or all-nighters may be ineffective, as the crucial post-experience memory processing is compromised.

These findings highlight the critical role of sleep in preserving cognitive health and may lead to targeted therapies aimed at enhancing memory. Interestingly, disrupted sleep could also be therapeutically utilized to prevent traumatic memories from becoming ingrained, potentially providing relief for conditions such as PTSD.

MIT and Broad Institute researchers have advanced gene editing, enabling efficient insertion or replacement of entire genes in human cells. Led by David Liu, this development could revolutionize treatments for diseases like cystic fibrosis, where multiple gene mutations are involved.

The new method, eePASSIGE, utilizes prime editing and a novel recombinase to insert large DNA segments directly into the genome's native locations. This approach surpasses traditional methods, which often require multiple edits for each mutation.

Liu's team enhanced the efficiency of gene integration by evolving a more effective version of the Bxb1 recombinase. The improved eePASSIGE system can integrate up to 30% of a gene's size, significantly more than previous methods.

This breakthrough could lead to a single gene therapy capable of treating a wide range of genetic disorders, regardless of specific mutations. By preserving the surrounding DNA sequence, the therapy aims to ensure proper gene regulation, avoiding over- or under-expression.

Liu's ongoing work focuses on integrating eePASSIGE with delivery systems like engineered virus-like particles (eVLPs) to overcome barriers in therapeutic gene delivery. This could pave the way for effective in vivo gene editing treatments.
