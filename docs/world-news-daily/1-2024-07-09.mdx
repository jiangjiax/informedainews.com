# World News Daily(2024-07-09) : French Political Instability due to Election Uncertainty

## French Political Instability due to Election Uncertainty

Macron retained Prime Minister Gabriel Attal after a chaotic election. No clear winner emerged; left, center, and right all fell short. The New Popular Front led but did not secure a majority. The far-right National Rally came in third. Despite a high voter turnout, France now faces a hung parliament, possibly leading to political gridlock.

This outcome has broader implications beyond French politics. It could affect the war in Ukraine, global diplomacy, and Europe's economy. Germany, a key partner, expressed relief that the far right did not dominate.

Attal planned to resign but will remain for now. His disagreement with Macron's decision to hold early elections highlights internal tensions. France's political uncertainty looms large, especially with the Paris Olympics approaching.

In summary, France's political landscape is fractured, with far-reaching implications. The stability of Europe and beyond hangs in the balance.

### Barcelona's Plan to Ban Airbnb Rentals to Address Housing Crisis

Barcelona plans to ban short-term rentals by November 2028. Mayor Jaume Collboni aims to reclaim 10,000 Airbnb apartments for long-term housing, addressing the city's severe housing crisis. This move reflects a global trend scrutinizing platforms like Airbnb and VRBO, questioning the balance between tourism and local welfare.

Critics blame Airbnb for inflating housing prices, forcing locals to endure unregulated hotel-like environments. However, a Harvard Business Review study suggests that outright bans might not lower rents significantly. In New York City, the ban led to record hotel rates, averaging $300 per night.

City councils may prioritize local sentiments over tourism, using bans to signal political responsiveness. Alternatives like Berlin's 90-day rental limit for owner-occupiers exist, balancing supplementary income for part-time hosts with housing stability.

The challenge lies in effective regulation. How to implement and fund such measures remains crucial. The debate continues, not just about numbers, but about community well-being and tourism's role.

### UN Official Welcomes Two-Week Truce in Congo Amid Alarming Violence

The top U.N. official in Congo, Bintou Keita, welcomed a two-week truce in the east, where violence is at "alarming levels." She hopes for a permanent ceasefire. Keita expressed concern over M23 rebel group's rapid expansion and attacks, despite Congolese army operations supported by U.N. peacekeepers and southern Africa forces.

Keita accused Rwanda of supporting M23, enabling territorial gains and risking a wider regional conflict. She also criticized other armed groups for "horrific attacks" causing hundreds of deaths and injuries.

Congo's President Felix Tshisekedi accuses Rwanda of military backing for M23, which Rwanda denies. U.S. deputy ambassador Stephanie Sullivan called Rwanda's support for M23 "irresponsible" and expressed alarm at the conflict's rapid escalation.

Sullivan urged Rwanda and Congo to de-escalate, commit to diplomatic processes, and hold accountable those responsible for human rights abuses. She commended the two-week truce, facilitated by the U.S. and Angola, and pledged to monitor it.

Congolese and Rwandan ambassadors exchanged accusations at the U.N. Security Council meeting. Congo's ambassador called for Rwandan troops' withdrawal and sanctions on Rwanda for supporting M23. Rwanda's ambassador claimed Congo failed to protect Congolese Tutsis and reiterated the need to address the FDLR rebel group's threat.

Myanmar's military, relentless, bombs civilians daily. 2024, a record year: 819 airstrikes, 359 dead, 756 wounded. Sanctions on jet fuel, meant to halt this, failed. U.S., Australia, Canada, EU, U.K. tried, but Myanmar adapted, sourced fuel from China, Malaysia, Vietnam. Amnesty International calls these bombings war crimes.

Jet A1 fuel, crucial for airstrikes, slipped through sanctions. Myanmar, lacking refining capacity, relies on imports. Singapore, main supplier, cut ties. Thailand emerged, supplying fuel via two companies, two banks. Swan Energy, a Yangon trader, claimed 100% market share, importing 10,000 tonnes monthly.

The military, embattled, doubles airstrikes, losing ground to insurgents. Civilians pay the price, caught in escalating violence. International efforts, fragmented, prove insufficient. Myanmar's military, undeterred, continues its campaign, indifferent to global outcry.

Germany's government has been selling large amounts of bitcoin, causing market volatility. The sales began last month, with the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) selling 900 bitcoins in June, followed by additional sales of 3,000 and 2,739 bitcoins in subsequent weeks. These sales, along with others from the collapsed exchange Mt. Gox, have pushed bitcoin's price down.

The German government seized nearly 50,000 bitcoins in 2024 from a movie piracy site, worth around $2.2 billion at the time. Currently, the BKA holds about 32,488 bitcoins, valued at roughly $1.9 billion. Some, like Bundestag member Joana Cotar, argue the government should hold onto bitcoin as a strategic reserve currency rather than sell it.

Despite the significant sales, bitcoin's overall market remains large, with around 19.7 million bitcoins in circulation, worth $1.1 trillion. The impact of these sales on bitcoin's price underscores the cryptocurrency's sensitivity to large-scale transactions and government actions.

On July 9, 2024, Europe's Ariane 6 rocket will launch from French Guiana, carrying nearly 12 satellites and experimental devices. This marks Europe's return to heavy-lift rockets. The launch is scheduled for 2 PM Eastern Time.

Ariane 6 has been highly anticipated, originally intended as a successor to the Ariane 5, which retired a year ago. The first flight of Ariane 6 will last 2 hours, 51 minutes, and 40 seconds. It will showcase the rocket's capability to reignite its second stage up to four times, enabling precise payload placement in various orbits and reducing space debris.

The rocket will carry 11 international payloads, including satellites and experimental units. Notably, two space capsules will return intact to Earth, providing valuable data for future spacecraft design.

Ariane 6 will launch in two configurations: A62 with two solid rocket boosters and A64 with four. These boosters, combined with a Vulcain 2.1 engine, will provide 350 tons of thrust. The second stage will utilize the Vinci engine to propel the rocket and its 10,350 kg payload into low Earth orbit.

Success for Ariane 6 could revitalize Europe's heavy-lift capabilities, offering flights at a lower cost than Ariane 5. However, competition from SpaceX and others presents a significant challenge.

The launch will be live-streamed by ESA, with options for French, German, and annotation-free broadcasts.

NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission successfully returned 121.6 grams of asteroid Bennu. Initial analysis indicates that the sample is abundant in carbon, nitrogen, and organic compounds—essential elements for life as we understand it. The sample also contains pristine magnesium-sodium phosphate, a first for any meteorite.

Bennu's composition suggests a history involving water, possibly originating from a small, ancient oceanic world. This discovery prompts questions about how these elements aggregated and provides insights into Bennu's past.

The asteroid's elements closely match those of the Sun, remaining unchanged since the formation of the solar system. This makes Bennu a time capsule, offering a window into the early solar system and potentially the prebiotic chemistry that preceded life on Earth.

Dante Lauretta, the principal investigator of OSIRIS-REx, highlights the significance of studying these materials, which are vital for understanding the solar system's formation and the origins of life.

  alt="Early Autism Diagnosis Possible Through Stool Samples"

Scientists have discovered variations in gut microbes between autistic and non-autistic children, which could pave the way for a simple stool test to diagnose autism early.

Presently, autism diagnosis can take three to four years, with most children being diagnosed at age six. Professor Qi Su's team has developed a method to diagnose autism in children under four using a panel of microbiome biomarkers.

Autism rates have increased due to heightened awareness and expanded diagnostic criteria. In the UK, approximately one in 100 people are on the autism spectrum. While genetic factors are significant, other contributors include older parents, birth complications, and environmental exposures.

Su's team examined stool samples from 1,627 children aged one to 13. They identified 51 types of bacteria, 18 viruses, 14 archaea, seven fungi, and a dozen metabolic pathways that were altered in autistic children. Through machine learning, they were able to accurately identify autistic children with 82% accuracy.

The study indicates that the microbiome may influence the severity of autism, potentially enabling personalized interventions such as dietary changes or probiotics to enhance gut diversity.

Dr. Dominic Farsi acknowledges the potential of this approach but emphasizes the need for further research. Dr. Elizabeth Lund stresses the importance of quicker, more automated diagnostic methods to address current backlogs and clinician shortages.

The team is currently investigating whether stool samples can diagnose autism in one-year-old children.
