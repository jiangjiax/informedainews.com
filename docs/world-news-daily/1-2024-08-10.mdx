# World News Daily(2024-08-10) : U.S. and States File Antitrust Lawsuit Against Google

## U.S. and States File Antitrust Lawsuit Against Google

The United States, along with 18 states and 38 additional jurisdictions, has filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google LLC. The suit, initiated under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, targets Google's alleged monopolization of general search services, search advertising, and text advertising markets. The plaintiffs accuse Google of maintaining these monopolies through anticompetitive practices.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the initial 18 states seek to restrain Google's monopolistic activities and remedy their effects. Meanwhile, 38 other states and jurisdictions have filed a separate action, incorporating the DOJ's allegations and adding further claims of Google's unlawful monopoly maintenance.

This legal action marks a significant challenge to Google's dominance in the tech industry, aiming to restore competition and fairness in the markets it allegedly controls.

Central banks worldwide are shifting away from the dollar and yuan, turning to gold as their reserve of choice. This move reflects growing geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties. The dollar's share in global foreign reserves has dipped to historic lows, currently at 58.9%.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine and subsequent U.S. sanctions have pushed emerging economies to favor gold, a 'stateless currency' not tied to any specific nation. This shift underscores global fragmentation.

Gold purchases by central banks have surged, with net purchases reaching 1,030 tonnes in 2023, following a record 1,082 tonnes in 2022. Countries like China, Brazil, and India are increasing their gold reserves while reducing their reliance on the yuan.

The trend towards gold reflects a broader move away from currencies linked to specific nations, driven by concerns over financial stability and geopolitical risks. As tensions persist, gold's appeal as a stable, independent asset continues to grow.

### U.K. Considers Stricter Tech Regulation Amid Disinformation-Fueled Unrest

The U.K. government is considering stricter tech regulation following recent violence fueled by online disinformation. Prime Minister Keir Starmer plans to review the Online Safety Act (OSA), which was enacted in September 2023. The OSA requires platforms to remove illegal content and protect users from harm, such as hate speech, with significant fines for non-compliance.

Starmer emphasizes that online spaces are not lawless, pointing to prosecutions for hate speech linked to the violence. However, he acknowledges the need for broader scrutiny of social media. London Mayor Sadiq Khan criticizes the OSA as inadequate.

The unrest started after a knife attack in Southport, with false claims about the attacker's identity causing widespread chaos. A woman was arrested for allegedly spreading these falsehoods.

The OSA, which is not yet fully operational, faces criticism for its drafting and for omitting provisions against "legal but harmful" speech. Critics argue it fails to address platforms' profit models based on outrage-driven engagement.

Platforms like Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) claim to enforce content standards, but enforcement is often opaque. The EU is already scrutinizing X for its handling of disinformation.

Once the OSA is fully operational, it could pressure platforms to more proactively manage misinformation. The U.K.'s internet regulator warns of the risks posed by social media in inciting violence.

### Security Researcher Exposes USPS Text Scam

Grant Smith, a security researcher, tackled a smishing scam aimed at USPS customers. Scammers sent texts, masquerading as USPS, requesting credit card details. Smith's wife was duped, sparking his investigation.

He traced the scammers to a Chinese-language group, infiltrated their systems, and collected evidence. He then collaborated with USPS and a US bank to safeguard over 438,000 credit cards.

The scam encompassed 1,133 domains, capturing over 1.2 million pieces of information. Smith's efforts likely only touched the surface, as similar scams have been identified in other countries.

Ukrainian forces ambushed a Russian convoy deep in Kursk, triggering a federal emergency in Russia. The Kremlin responded by moving military reserves, including Grad rockets and tanks, to the region.

A video showed the destroyed convoy near Oktyabrskoe, with casualties evident. This attack mirrored earlier strikes near Kyiv, showcasing Ukraine's hit-and-run tactics.

In Kursk, the acting governor urged calm among residents, while 3,000 civilians were evacuated. Meanwhile, a Russian missile hit a supermarket in Kostiantynivka, killing 10 Ukrainians and injuring 35.

Ukraine's incursion into Kursk marked a significant shift, employing fast-moving maneuver warfare, a stark contrast to the trench-dominated battles seen previously.

Russian military bloggers reported Ukraine's capture of parts of Sudzha, with tactics involving armored vehicles and ambushes. Ukraine's leaders have been cautious in their public comments about the operation.

Analysts suggest this attack has psychologically impacted Putin's image and might divert Russian forces from the Donbas, easing pressure on Ukraine's eastern front.

The White House has shown support for Ukraine's actions, despite previous concerns about escalating the conflict. The Pentagon emphasized its policy consistency but reiterated its opposition to long-range attacks into Russia.

### Scientists Propose Lunar Vault for Endangered Species DNA

  alt="Scientists Propose Lunar Vault for Endangered Species DNA"

Scientists propose a lunar vault for endangered DNA. No power, no liquid nitrogen needed. Moon's shadowed craters stay cold enough.

Led by Smithsonian, the plan aims to safeguard Earth's vanishing species. They target high-risk species first, then expand. The idea? Use the moon's natural chill.

The proposal draws from Norway's seed vault, but for animal cells, which need colder temps. Earth's setups rely on liquid nitrogen, power, and manpower—all vulnerable.

Moon's poles have pits never hit by sun. These spots hit -410°F (-246°C), perfect for passive freezing. To shield from space radiation, store samples underground or in thick lunar rock.

They've frozen fish skin cells, a good test case. These cells are easier to collect than eggs or sperm and can represent many species.

Next, test radiation resistance on Earth. Seek partners for more trials, maybe on the International Space Station.

Imagine a public-private lunar vault, managed like the seed bank. Not a doomsday plan, but a safeguard against disasters, and a boost for space travel. Life, precious and rare, deserves this backup.

Africa CDC may declare a public health emergency due to rising mpox cases. Dr. Jean Kaseya, the director, warns of a potential pandemic if borders aren't secured. This week, 887 new cases pushed the year's total to 15,132, a 160% increase from last year. Sixteen countries are affected, with the Democratic Republic of Congo leading in cases and deaths.

Mpox, a viral disease causing rashes and flu-like symptoms, is related to smallpox. It spreads through direct contact. A new, more virulent strain was reported in the DRC. Vaccine shortages in Africa complicate control efforts; only 200,000 doses are available against a demand of 10 million. The AU approved $10.4 million to support the fight against mpox.

Kaseya emphasizes collective action. The WHO may declare a global emergency. The process involves technical consultations and a summit of African Union heads of state.

Gender controversy at Paris Olympics sparks debate. Algeria's Imane Khelif and Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting faced disqualification and slander. Misinformation spread, labeling them transgender or claiming disorder of sex development (DSD). DSD refers to variations in chromosomes or reproductive organs.

IBA and IOC conflict complicates matters. IBA's gender tests and public naming raise issues. History shows past gender suspicions and invasive checks. IOC's 1968 chromosomal tests led to mental health crises. Tests abolished in 2000 due to discrimination and scientific doubts.

Science now recognizes gender complexity. XY chromosomes don't always mean masculine bodies. Sports separate men and women by testosterone levels, but this method is flawed. Testosterone's impact on strength varies, and it's not the sole factor for athletic prowess.

The debate continues, highlighting the need for fairer, safer sports policies.
