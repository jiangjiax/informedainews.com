# World News Daily(2024-10-06) : Scientists Discover Plastic-Eating Bacteria to Combat Pollution

## Scientists Discover Plastic-Eating Bacteria to Combat Pollution

Scientists discovered a bacteria, Comamonas testosteroni, that consumes plastic. This bacteria breaks down polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a common plastic found in bottles and packaging. PET accounts for 12% of global waste. Unlike other bacteria, C. testosteroni thrives on complex materials like plastics.

The researchers outlined six steps the bacteria use to break down plastic into a food source. These processes need optimization to work more quickly. Adding acetate, a chemical, could enhance their efficiency.

This discovery could be a crucial step toward solving plastic pollution.

### California Updates Consumer Privacy Act to Protect Neural Data

California has updated its Consumer Privacy Act to include "neural data"—information collected from a person's brain or nerves. This data, previously unregulated, is now protected from unauthorized sale or sharing. Consumers gain rights to know what data is collected and to delete it. The law aims to safeguard mental privacy and sets a precedent for the neurotechnology industry.

### Mossad's Covert Operation: Exploding Pagers Against Hezbollah

Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, orchestrated a covert operation targeting Hezbollah. The plan involved selling 5,000 booby-trapped pagers disguised as Taiwanese-branded Apollo devices. Hezbollah, wary of Israeli surveillance, believed these pagers were secure.

In February, Hezbollah distributed the pagers to mid-level fighters. On September 17, Mossad remotely detonated the devices, killing or injuring up to 3,000 Hezbollah members and an unknown number of civilians. The pagers were designed to explode when users attempted to decrypt a message, ensuring maximum casualties.

This operation was part of a broader strategy. Mossad had previously infiltrated Hezbollah with similarly rigged walkie-talkies, which had been used for eavesdropping until the crisis. The success of the pager attack led Israel to launch airstrikes on Hezbollah's headquarters and arsenals, further weakening the group.

The operation demonstrated Mossad's ingenuity and Hezbollah's vulnerability. It underscored the high stakes of intelligence warfare in the Middle East.

More than 1.4 million people have cast their votes in the presidential election. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are neck-and-neck, crisscrossing the country in the final stretch.

Their vice-presidential picks, JD Vance and Tim Walz, faced off in the only vice-presidential debate. Initial polls suggest the debate had little impact on the race.

Harris's national polling average reached its highest since July. However, the race remains extremely close in battleground states. Harris leads in five of seven swing states, according to recent polls. But overall, both candidates have about even odds of winning.

7-Eleven, once a beacon of retail wisdom, now faces an uncertain future. Its parent company, Seven&i Holdings, has received a preliminary acquisition offer from Alimentation Couche-Tard (ACT), a Canadian convenience store giant. If successful, this deal would be the largest foreign acquisition of a Japanese company and create a retail empire with over 200,000 stores.

ACT, with over 16,700 stores globally, has a history of aggressive acquisitions. Its strategy mirrors that of Chinese sportswear giant Anta, using mergers to expand rapidly. ACT's recent financials show growth but also regional weaknesses, particularly in the U.S. and Europe.

The proposed acquisition could be a game-changer for ACT, offering new growth opportunities and valuable Asian market insights. However, Seven&i has rejected the initial $39 billion offer, seeking a higher valuation.

This potential deal raises questions about 7-Eleven's legacy and the evolving retail landscape. ACT's ambition to dominate the global convenience store market is clear, but the path to success is fraught with challenges.

**Key Terms:**
- **EBITDA:** Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. A measure of a company's operating performance.
- **Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A):** Business strategies involving the combination of different companies or assets.

  alt="Li Denghai: The Journey from Junior High School Graduate to Expert in Corn Breeding"
/>

Li Denghai, a farmer who only graduated from junior high school, continues to toil in the cornfields at over 70 years old. The corn seeds he cultivated have been promoted for a cumulative total of 1 billion mu (about 165 million hectares), increasing the number of people supported per mu from 1 to 4.5, earning him the title of "Father of China's Compact Hybrid Corn."

In 1972, at the age of 23, Li Denghai set his sights on challenging the cultivation of a new corn variety with a yield of 1,500 jin (about 750 kg) per mu. He self-taught theoretical knowledge, studied late into the night, and narrowly avoided a fire. In 1974, he entered Laiyang Agricultural School for further studies, completing a four-year curriculum in just one year.

In 1978, Li Denghai went to Hainan, living in thatched huts, eating dried radish, and sleeping only three to four hours a day. After numerous failures, in 1979, he finally cultivated the "Yedan No. 2" with a yield of 776.9 kg per mu, fulfilling his goal set seven years earlier.

In 1984, Li Denghai resigned from his position as the deputy director of the county science committee to focus on corn breeding. In 1985, he raised funds to establish the Hou Deng Experimental Station, which later developed into Denghai Seeds. Through demonstration fields and mergers and acquisitions, he expanded Denghai Seeds across the country.

In 2005, Li Denghai's "Denghai Super Test No. 1" achieved a yield of 1,402.86 kg per mu, once again breaking the world record. That same year, Denghai Seeds went public, becoming the third stock in the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock markets named after an individual.

Li Denghai's story is a microcosm of several generations of Chinese agricultural scientists. They have written extraordinary lives on the land with their sweat and wisdom.

Meta, the tech giant, has hit new highs with its recent innovations. In September, they unveiled Orion, an advanced AR headset, and on October 4th, they introduced Movie Gen, a sophisticated video generation model.

Movie Gen boasts four key features: video creation, personalized video generation, precise editing, and audio synthesis. It can produce 1080P, 16-second videos and up to 45 seconds of high-quality audio. However, like Sora, Movie Gen is still a "futures" product, not yet available to the public.

Meta's AI research team has detailed the model's architecture in a 92-page paper. The Movie Gen Video model, with 30 billion parameters, generates high-quality videos up to 16 seconds long. The Movie Gen Audio model, with 13 billion parameters, creates synchronized audio up to 45 seconds.

Despite its capabilities, Movie Gen faces challenges. Generating a video from text can take up to tens of minutes, prompting Meta to focus on efficiency improvements for mobile deployment.

Meta's stock has surged, with a 70% increase this year, pushing its market cap to $1.51 trillion. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has surpassed Jeff Bezos as the world's second-richest person.

Meta's success in AI has turned its fortunes around. Their Q2 2024 earnings showed a 22% revenue increase and a 73% profit rise, driven by AI investments enhancing their ad platform. Analysts predict continued growth, with Q3 2024 revenue expected between $38.5 and $41 billion.

In essence, Meta's relentless pursuit of AI innovation has not only boosted its financial performance but also solidified its position as a tech leader.

### Rio Tinto in Talks to Acquire Arcadium, a Major Lithium Miner

Rio Tinto is in talks to buy Arcadium, a lithium miner. If the deal goes through, Rio would become the world's third-largest lithium producer, behind Albemarle and SQM. Arcadium, based in Philadelphia, could be valued between $4 billion and $6 billion.

Lithium is crucial for electric vehicle (EV) batteries. Demand is set to surge as EVs become more common. Arcadium's shares have dropped over 50% this year due to a slump in lithium prices, making it an attractive target.

Arcadium has mines and processing facilities on four continents. Its customers include Tesla, BMW, and General Motors. The company also has expertise in direct lithium extraction (DLE), a method that filters lithium from brines without evaporation ponds.

Rio Tinto, already a major copper and iron ore producer, aims to expand its lithium footprint. The deal could give Rio access to Arcadium's global operations and DLE technology.

Arcadium was formed in January by merging Livent and Allkem. Analysts see the merger as a strong case for Rio to buy Arcadium. The deal would also align with the mining industry's growing interest in critical minerals for the energy transition.

Chinese scholars have published the world's first universal CAR-T therapy results on the front page of Nature's official website. This research, led by Professor Xu Huji's team from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Naval Medical University, utilized CRISPR-Cas9 technology to modify CAR-T cells from healthy donors, developing an allogeneic universal CAR-T therapy. This therapy successfully helped three patients with rheumatic and immune diseases achieve long-term remission.

CAR-T cell therapy (chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy) was previously mainly used to treat blood cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma. This study marks a significant breakthrough in the field by being the first to apply it to the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

The research shows that the universal CAR-T therapy is not only effective but also has the potential to significantly reduce costs and production time, meeting the needs of a large number of patients. However, whether donor-derived CAR-T cell therapy carries other risks still requires further research.

Professor Xu Huji's team has treated 24 patients with different types of allogeneic CAR-T cells, achieving expected results. This progress demonstrates the enormous potential of this therapy in the treatment of immune diseases, signaling that treatment has entered a new stage.

Lachlan Morton, an Australian pro cyclist, has completed a 14,200km ride around Australia in just 30 days, nine hours, and 59 minutes. This shatters the previous record of 38 days set by David Alley in 2011. Morton averaged over 450km per day, riding through the night and sleeping for six or seven hours. He finished in Port Macquarie, his hometown.

The ride, undertaken to raise funds for the Indigenous Literacy Foundation, has so far collected $130,000. Morton rode anti-clockwise, passing through Sydney, Brisbane, Darwin, Broome, Perth, Esperance, Adelaide, and Melbourne. The rules required him to cover at least 14,200km and pass through these eight locations.

Morton faced physical and mental challenges, pushing himself into uncharted territory. He had a few close calls with road hazards, including a kangaroo, and deviated from his planned route for safety. Despite the hardships, he found strength in the relentless headwinds of Western Australia and South Australia.

Morton’s achievement is a testament to endurance and determination. His ride not only set a new record but also made a significant impact on remote Indigenous communities through his fundraising efforts.

Bangkok's vegan dining scene is booming, driven by social media and celebrity influence. Sittileun Tortianchai, co-owner of Veganerie, opened the first branch in 2014. Now, with seven outlets, the chain caters mainly to foreigners. Thailand, famous for its meat-centric street food, has a long-standing vegetarian tradition. During Buddhist holidays, many Thais adopt vegetarian diets.

Veganism, however, is relatively new. It's gaining traction, partly due to the "mindfulness" lifestyle popular in tourist spots like Koh Phangan and Pai. Bangkok's cosmopolitan vibe attracts expatriates and tourists, boosting demand for vegan options. Nat, manager of Plantiful, notes that while Western and Indian diners dominate, more Thais are trying vegan dishes.

For Thais, veganism isn't tied to Western ideological debates. Instead, it's seen as a healthy lifestyle choice, influenced by social media. Sittileun reports that 20% of Veganerie's customers are Thai, driven by health concerns rather than environmental issues.

The variety of vegan food is expanding. International dishes and vegan versions of Thai classics are becoming more common. Tofu often replaces meat or fish. Vistro, a vegan restaurant in Phrom Phong, was inspired by global vegan trends.

In summary, Bangkok's vegan scene is evolving, blending local traditions with international influences. Social media and celebrity endorsements play a crucial role, making veganism more accessible and appealing to a broader audience.

Laos, a nation rich in water resources, is set to pioneer a novel coffee roasting venture using green hydrogen. TSB Greenex, a Japanese environmental firm, has partnered with eight other companies to launch the Green Hydrogen Valley Project in Laos. The project aims to roast locally grown Arabica coffee beans using hydrogen fuel, produced from water via hydroelectricity.

Hydroelectricity, which accounts for 80% of Laos' power mix, is significantly cheaper than in Japan or Thailand. This cost advantage allows TSB to produce green hydrogen—separated from water using carbon-free electricity—at a competitive price, despite it being 20-30% more expensive than fossil fuel-derived hydrogen.

The coffee roasting plant, slated to open in Champasak province by mid-2026, will have a yearly capacity of 3,000 tonnes, comparable to Laos' largest coffee producer. The hydrogen-roasted coffee is expected to be 10-20% cheaper than conventional coffee, appealing to price-conscious consumers.

This initiative not only leverages Laos' natural resources but also positions the country to create value-added products, a crucial step in its economic development. The project could set a precedent for sustainable coffee production, blending environmental responsibility with economic viability.
