  alt="Pakistan Renegotiates Power Contracts to Save $1.48 Billion and Reduce Tariffs"
/>

Pakistan has terminated power purchase contracts with five private companies, including its largest utility, to save $1.48 billion. The move aims to reduce electricity tariffs amid soaring energy costs.

Power Minister Awais Leghari explained that the government reviewed agreements with independent power producers (IPPs) to determine which plants were necessary. The decision to end take-or-pay agreements—where the government pays for capacity regardless of usage—will save nearly 411 billion rupees over the coming years.

Negotiations are underway with other IPPs to revise contracts, with the goal of lowering consumer tariffs. This effort aligns with Pakistan's discussions with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a $7 billion bailout.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif announced that renegotiating contracts with five IPPs would save 60 billion rupees annually. Hub Power Company, Pakistan's biggest private utility, agreed to end a power purchase contract early, in the "greater national interest."

A decade ago, Pakistan approved numerous IPP projects to address chronic shortages. However, economic crises led to reduced consumption and excess capacity, resulting in high fixed costs and capacity payments. These costs were passed on to consumers, sparking protests.

Pakistan is also negotiating with China to restructure power sector debt and implement reforms, though progress has been slow. The government plans to end power sector subsidies.

**Insights:**
The decision to renegotiate power contracts reflects a pragmatic approach to managing economic challenges. By addressing excess capacity and reducing costs, Pakistan aims to stabilize its energy sector and ease the financial burden on consumers. However, the success of these measures depends on effective negotiations and implementation, as well as broader economic recovery.

/>

The venom of the black widow spider contains seven toxins, among which α-latrotoxin is toxic to vertebrates. This toxin disrupts nerve signals, leading to muscle spasms.

Research from the University of Münster has revealed the complex mechanism of α-latrotoxin. After binding to nerve cell receptors, the toxin forms calcium channels, allowing calcium ions to flow in and trigger muscle contractions.

The study, utilizing cryo-electron microscopy and molecular dynamics simulations, found that the toxin molecules form a stalk-like structure that penetrates the cell membrane, creating small pores that act as calcium channels.

Professor Christos Gatsogiannis noted that α-latrotoxin mimics the function of calcium channels, differing from known toxins. The research findings were published in *Nature Communications*.

This study not only unveils the toxin's mechanism but also demonstrates its potential in the medical and biotechnological fields, such as developing antidotes and biological pesticides.

In 1947, NASA sent fruit flies into space to test if they could survive the journey. These tiny creatures share 60% of our genetic code, making them ideal for such experiments.

A recent study in *Nature* mapped every one of the 139,255 brain cells in an adult fruit fly. These cells, connected by over 50 million synaptic connections, control everything from perception to action. The longest cells in the fly’s brain, if stretched out, would be 43 times longer than the fly itself.

Hundreds of scientists have spent over a decade creating this detailed map. They’ve identified over 8,000 cell types, 4,581 of which are new discoveries. This surpasses the 3,300 cell types identified in humans, many of which remain mysterious.

The study reveals how sensory signals prompt flies to walk, stop, or eat. Despite being 500 times smaller than humans and having a million times fewer neurons, this research offers profound insights into brain function.

**Synaptic connections**: Links between neurons that allow them to communicate.

**Connectome**: A comprehensive map of neural connections in the brain.

/>

A century after British climbers George Mallory and Andrew “Sandy” Irvine vanished on Everest, a climber’s foot, identified as Irvine’s, has been found. The discovery, made by Jimmy Chin, includes a boot and sock with a label reading “AC Irvine.” Mallory’s body was found in 1999, but Irvine’s remains had eluded searchers until now.

The foot was found at a lower altitude than Mallory’s body, suggesting Irvine may have fallen further. Mallory’s body bore rope marks, hinting at a fall, but the absence of a photograph he intended to leave on the summit raises the possibility that they reached the top. Irvine, who was 22, was believed to be carrying a Kodak camera, which could resolve whether they summited, but it remains missing.

Julie Summers, Irvine’s great-niece, expressed deep emotion at the discovery, having lived with the mystery since childhood. The find provides closure for the family and the climbing community, offering a clue to what happened on that fateful day in 1924.

The remains are now with the China Tibet Mountaineering Association. Prof Joe Smith of the Royal Geographical Society praised the discovery, noting Irvine’s significant contribution to Everest exploration.
