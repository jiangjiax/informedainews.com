Thailand has legalized same-sex marriage, becoming the first country in Southeast Asia to do so. The law, endorsed by King Maha Vajiralongkorn, grants LGBTQ couples equal rights, including tax benefits, inheritance, and adoption. Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra celebrated the milestone, emphasizing "Love Wins." A support group urges couples to register immediately. Despite a reputation for tolerance, Thailand's laws previously fell short. The ruling party prioritized this reform.

### Israel and Hezbollah Escalate Conflict Amid Deadly Strikes in Lebanon

Israel and Hezbollah exchanged heavy blows. Israel targeted Hezbollah positions in Lebanon, while Hezbollah struck military facilities in Israel. Lebanon experienced its deadliest day in decades, with 558 people killed, including 50 children and 94 women.

Israel's military chief, Herzi Halevi, pledged to intensify attacks on Hezbollah. Overnight, Israel launched strikes on dozens of Hezbollah targets, including missile launchers and weapon storage facilities. Hezbollah responded by hitting an explosives factory in Israel with Fadi rockets.

Beirut was again hit, with an Israeli airstrike targeting a Hezbollah commander. The strike damaged a building in the Ghobeiry neighborhood. Hezbollah also attacked the Megiddo airfield near Afula.

Lebanon's hospitals are overwhelmed, and Haifa's main hospital has moved operations underground. The UN anticipates tens of thousands of displaced people in Lebanon.

The US is deploying more troops to the region, raising concerns of a broader conflict involving Iran and its proxies. The G7 expressed concern about the risk of a wider war.

Israel's intelligence and technological superiority has given it a strong advantage, enabling it to track and assassinate top Hezbollah and Hamas leaders.

The escalating conflict threatens to destabilize the Middle East, exacerbating the ongoing war in Gaza.

  alt="The Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee meeting promotes the stabilization and recovery of the real estate market."
/>

The Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee convened a meeting on September 26, clearly stating the need to stabilize and reverse the decline in the real estate market. The meeting called for strict control over the increase in commercial housing construction, optimization of existing stock, improvement in quality, and increased lending for projects on the "white list" to support the revitalization of idle land. At the same time, addressing public concerns, it proposed adjustments to housing purchase restrictions, reductions in existing mortgage rates, and improvements to policies related to land, fiscal and taxation, and finance, to promote the establishment of a new model for real estate development.

The central rate of mortgage rates is expected to further decline, with the LPR likely to be cut by 20-25 basis points as soon as the October 20th LPR announcement, leading to a further downward shift in the central mortgage rate. Additionally, reductions in housing transaction taxes, including exemptions from deed tax, value-added tax, individual income tax, and other real estate transaction taxes, are intended to stimulate housing consumption.

Among first-tier cities, Guangzhou is most likely to be the first to fully lift purchase restrictions, followed by Shenzhen, while it is unlikely for Beijing and Shanghai to fully lift purchase restrictions. For second and third-tier cities, demand-side policies will mainly focus on incentives through credit policies, trade-in policies, and housing subsidies.

On the supply side, policies will promote the construction of high-quality residential properties, optimize floor area ratio rules to increase the actual usable area, moderately reduce the retention ratio for pre-sale funds of high-quality projects, encourage premium pricing, and no longer implement price guidance for new housing. Pilot projects for sales of completed properties will be advanced, with increased development loan quotas, extended loan terms, and reduced loan rates for such projects.

**Note:**
- **LPR (Loan Prime Rate):** The Loan Prime Rate is a type of interest rate in the Chinese interbank market.
- **BP (Basis Point):** A basis point is equal to 0.01%.

### Man Exonerated After 58 Years on Death Row

In 1966, a fire at a Japanese miso factory claimed the lives of a family of four. The sole survivor, the eldest daughter, accused factory worker Hakamada Iwao of the murder. Police arrested Hakamada, subjected him to brutal interrogations, and coerced a confession from him. Despite DNA evidence later exonerating him, Hakamada was sentenced to death in 1968.

For 48 years, Hakamada remained in prison, becoming the world's longest-serving death row inmate. His sister, Hakamada Hideko, tirelessly fought for his release. In 2014, a court finally granted him a retrial and released him.

The case revolved around a blood-stained pajama top found in Hakamada's dormitory. Initial tests revealed that the blood type did not match his. Despite this, police continued to press the case, fabricating evidence and manipulating the trial.

A retired judge, Kumamoto Norimichi, who had originally voted for Hakamada's conviction, later expressed doubts. He believed the confession was coerced and the evidence was fabricated.

In 2023, after decades of struggle, Hakamada was finally exonerated. The court acknowledged the flaws in the original trial and the misconduct of the police.

This case highlights the dangers of coerced confessions and the importance of thorough, unbiased investigations. It serves as a stark reminder of the fragility of justice and the need for constant vigilance.

Hong Kong’s Umbrella Movement, a decade ago, saw thousands protest Beijing’s curtailment of democratic rights. Today, the city’s governance has shifted, with national security laws stifling freedoms. Visa denials and entry restrictions have driven away international talent, replaced by mainland Chinese influx.

Neta Auto, one of over 100 Chinese EV makers, faces fierce competition. Founder Fang Yunzhou admits survival is uncertain. Only a few, like BYD and Li Auto, are profitable. Despite tariffs, Neta eyes North America and Europe.

The FBI probes Hone Capital, a Silicon Valley venture fund with Chinese backing. Investigators suspect Beijing accessed U.S. tech startups’ secrets. Hone, launched in 2015 with $115 million from China, invested in 360 startups, including driverless car and aerospace firms.

China’s EV subsidies remain contentious. Europe and the U.S. cite these as justification for tariffs. CATL, a leading battery supplier, tops the list of subsidy recipients.

**Insights:**
The geopolitical tension between the U.S. and China extends to tech and automotive sectors. Hong Kong’s transformation underscores Beijing’s tightening grip. The EV market, globally competitive, faces survival challenges. Subsidies and tariffs highlight the economic and political stakes.

### ADB Adjusts Inflation and GDP Forecasts for Developing Asia

  alt="ADB Adjusts Inflation and GDP Forecasts for Developing Asia"

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has adjusted its inflation outlook for developing Asia, predicting a slight easing in price pressures for 2024 and 2025. Inflation is now forecasted at 2.8% for 2024, down from the previous 2.9% estimate. For 2025, it’s projected at 2.9%, revised from 3.0%.

Energy inflation has returned to pre-pandemic levels, while food inflation, though declining, remains slightly elevated. Core inflation has eased below pre-pandemic levels.

In Southeast Asia, inflation projections for 2024 and 2025 were revised upwards, influenced by currency depreciations in Laos and Myanmar. Laos’ inflation forecast stands at 25%, the highest in the region.

Despite these adjustments, the ADB maintained its GDP growth forecast for developing Asia at 5.0% for 2024, driven by sustained global electronics demand. Southeast Asia’s GDP growth was revised slightly downwards to 4.5%.

Thailand’s GDP outlook was cut due to subdued government spending and weaker export recovery. Singapore’s forecast was raised, driven by increased demand for electronics and financial services.

The report highlights risks, including rising protectionism, the U.S. presidential election, geopolitical tensions, and China’s troubled property market. These factors could negatively impact developing Asia’s economy.

Lady Gaga is set to release "Harlequin," her seventh studio album, as a companion to the upcoming film "Joker: Folie à Deux." The album, announced on September 24, is expected to be the highlight of the movie, which has received mixed reviews.

The album features a mix of covers and original tracks, including songs like "Good Morning," "World On A String," and "That’s Life." These selections suggest a nod to classic Hollywood and jazz, aligning with Gaga's previous work and the musical nature of the film.

Gaga's cryptic social media teasers leading up to the announcement sparked excitement among her fans, known as Little Monsters. The album art, depicting Gaga in a shower with running makeup and a life vest, adds a compelling visual element.

In typical Hemingway fashion, I’d say this album is likely to be the standout element of the film. Gaga’s talent for blending old-school charm with modern flair ensures "Harlequin" will be a memorable addition to her discography.

### Woman Dies After Non-Surgical BBL Procedure, Two Arrested

Alice Webb, a 33-year-old mother of five, died following a non-surgical Brazilian butt lift (BBL) procedure. Two individuals have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter. Webb fell ill and passed away at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital. This marks the first known death from a BBL in the UK.

BBL involves injecting fat or dermal filler into the buttocks to alter size or shape. While not illegal, the procedure carries risks such as blood clots, sepsis, and tissue death. Several UK local authorities have banned certain companies from performing liquid BBLs due to these dangers.

Webb's partner, Dane Knight, urged the public to consider her daughters' feelings before speculating about her death. Gloucestershire Police's major crime team is investigating.

Save Face, a register of accredited non-surgical cosmetic practitioners, has supported 500 women with complications from BBL. Director Ashton Collins described liquid BBLs as "a crisis waiting to happen," criticizing their promotion as risk-free and cheaper alternatives to surgical BBLs.

### Study Suggests Ozempic May Reduce Opioid Overdose Risk in Diabetic Patients

Novo Nordisk's diabetes drug Ozempic, which contains semaglutide, may reduce the risk of opioid overdose in patients with Type 2 diabetes and opioid use disorder, according to a study published in JAMA Network Open. The study, which was not funded by Novo Nordisk, analyzed nearly 33,000 patient records from 2017 to 2023. Users of semaglutide showed a 58% lower risk of overdose compared to those taking other diabetes medications.

The study suggests that Ozempic could be a tool in combating the U.S. opioid crisis, which was declared a public health emergency in 2017. Currently, only about 25% of patients with opioid use disorder receive recommended treatments, with many discontinuing treatment within six months. Opioids are responsible for 72% of overdose deaths in the U.S.

GLP-1 drugs, such as Ozempic, are increasingly being studied for benefits beyond diabetes and obesity, including in chronic conditions and addictive behaviors. More clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings and determine the drug's efficacy in broader populations of opioid use disorder patients.

**Key Terms:**
- **GLP-1s:** A class of drugs that enhance insulin secretion and reduce glucagon release, used for diabetes and obesity.
- **Opioid Use Disorder:** A chronic condition characterized by problematic use of opioids, leading to significant impairment or distress.

### Japan's Rice Shortage: Weather, Tourism, and Policy Impacts

Japan is experiencing its worst rice shortage in decades, fueled by adverse weather, increased tourist demand, and restrictive policies. Summer 2024 witnessed empty supermarket shelves as demand outpaced production for three consecutive years, depleting stocks to 20-year lows. Consumers stockpiled rice in anticipation of typhoons and earthquakes. By August, white rice was frequently out of stock, and prices soared to 16,133 yen per 60kg, a 5% increase since January.

Private rice inventories reached 1.56 million tons in June, the lowest in years. Tourists, particularly sushi enthusiasts, doubled rice consumption from 19,000 to 51,000 tons. Despite this, tourist demand remains insignificant compared to domestic consumption of over 7 million tons. Japan welcomed a record 17.8 million visitors in the first half of the year, including 3.3 million in July alone.

Aging farmers and a lack of young recruits have reduced production. Last year's heatwaves and drought further compromised harvests. Japan's rice policies, including a 778% tariff on imports, isolate its market. While it imports 682,000 tons annually under WTO obligations, this rice is primarily for processing and feed, not direct consumption. Exports have surged sixfold since 2014 to nearly 30,000 tons.

Higher rice prices contributed to Japan's 2.8% inflation in August, driven by energy and food costs. Rice and chocolate were major factors in rising food prices.

### McDonald's Kiosks: Job Creation and Operational Complexity

McDonald's kiosks, initially feared as job killers, have paradoxically created more jobs. Franchisees, owning 95% of U.S. McDonald's, deploy kiosks that handle cash and change. Instead of reducing staff, these kiosks reassign cashiers to new roles like "guest experience leads," aiding customers with kiosks and resolving issues.

RJ Hottovy, an analyst at Placer.ai, notes that kiosks haven't cut labor; they've added complexity. With mobile ordering and delivery, labor saved by kiosks is redirected. Kiosks have even flopped in some cases, like at Bowlero, where lack of training rendered them useless.

Kiosks' touted benefits—upselling and speeding orders—aren't guaranteed. Temple University research shows that kiosk lines stress customers, leading to fewer purchases. Some customers take longer on kiosks than with cashiers. Malfunctions and breakdowns further complicate matters.

Kiosks were seen as a response to higher minimum wage laws. Yet, the restaurant industry continues to grow, with staffing levels 3% above pre-pandemic levels. Christopher Andrews, a sociologist at Drew University, compares kiosks to ATMs and self-checkout machines. ATMs didn't eliminate bank teller jobs; they shifted tasks, freeing tellers for higher-value work. Similarly, self-checkout hasn't led to retail job losses; it's increased merchandise losses due to customer errors and shoplifting.

In essence, kiosks haven't streamlined labor; they've reshaped it, creating new roles and complexities.
