# World News Daily(2024-07-27) : Russia and China Conduct First Joint Bomber Patrol Near Alaska

## Russia and China Conduct First Joint Bomber Patrol Near Alaska

Russia and China sent bombers near Alaska for a joint patrol, marking the first time in that region. Two Russian Tu-95s and two Chinese Xian H-6s flew over the Chukchi and Bering seas, escorted by Russian fighter jets. The flight lasted over five hours.

Russia stated that the drill was not against any third country, but it prompted the U.S. and Canada to dispatch their own jets for interception. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin noted that the bombers remained about 200 miles off the coast.

This move underscores the deepening military ties between Russia and China, partly serving as a message to the West, particularly following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Both countries have ramped up joint military exercises since 2019.

Alexander Gabuev from the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center views this as a signal to the U.S. that Russia is not alone, having a powerful partner with a significant nuclear arsenal.

The bombers did not enter U.S. or Canadian airspace. They operated within the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), a perimeter just outside U.S. airspace where aircraft must be identified for security purposes. NORAD, the joint U.S.-Canada defense operation, did not perceive the bombers as a threat.

PARIS—On July 26, 2024, sabotage struck French high-speed rail lines just hours before the Olympics opening ceremony. Incendiary devices ignited fires, crippling TGV lines. Transport Minister Patrice Vergriete described it as a "massive attack."

The disruptions were concentrated at Montparnasse station. Videos revealed crowded hallways. Paris police increased security measures. Travel to London, Belgium, and throughout France was severely impacted. SNCF characterized the incidents as coordinated.

Government officials denounced the acts, although no direct link to the Olympics was established. Sports Minister Amelie Oudea-Castera highlighted the impact on both travelers and athletes. Eurostar cautioned about potential delays.

SNCF was uncertain when traffic would resume, anticipating disruptions to persist throughout the weekend. They urged passengers to postpone their journeys. Valerie Pecresse, from the regional council, estimated that 250,000 travelers were affected. While substitution plans were in effect, she advised against visiting the stations.

The attack occurred amidst global tensions and heightened security measures for the Olympics. Many were planning to attend the opening ceremony, exacerbating the chaos.

UN chief Guterres criticizes wealthy nations for increasing oil and gas production, warning that this threatens global climate objectives. New drilling initiatives could emit 12 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases, equivalent to China's yearly emissions.

Guterres advocates for the cessation of fossil fuel subsidies and new coal projects, and calls for support for countries vulnerable to climate effects. Record-breaking heatwaves have swept across the globe, resulting in over 1,300 deaths in Mecca.

A UN report reveals 489,000 annual heat-related fatalities from 2000 to 2019. More than 70% of the global workforce, approximately 2.4 billion people, are at risk from extreme heat. Guterres promotes low-carbon cooling solutions and urban redesign to manage heat.

He identifies the reliance on fossil fuels as the "disease" that requires a cure. UK's Miliband supports the transition away from fossil fuels for energy security and climate action.

Manhattan prosecutors remain resolute. They assert that Trump's conviction stands, despite his claims of immunity. The case involves hush money paid to a porn star, Stormy Daniels. Trump's team contends that the Supreme Court's immunity ruling should nullify the verdict. Prosecutors counter, highlighting Trump's actions and personal transactions prior to his presidency.

Trump was charged with 34 felonies. He falsified business records to conceal the $130,000 payment made by Cohen. Trump denies the affair and intends to appeal. He is the first former president to be convicted of a crime.

The Supreme Court has ruled that presidents are immune from criminal charges related to official acts. However, this case primarily concerns Trump's personal life before he assumed office. Judge Juan Merchan may not dismiss the verdict. He is expected to make a decision by September 6th. If the conviction is upheld, Trump faces sentencing and the possibility of further appeals.

Key points:
- Trump convicted of falsifying business records.
- Prosecutors argue the case is unaffected by the recent immunity ruling.
- Judge to decide on the conviction by early September.
- If upheld, Trump faces sentencing and potential appeal.

  alt="The Limits of Predicting Life Outcomes with Data"

Researchers attempted to forecast children's futures using data and algorithms. They analyzed over 4,000 American families over a span of 15 years, beginning from a child's birth. The aim was to predict academic and personal outcomes by the age of 15.

The predictions were inaccurate. Ian Lundberg, a sociologist, was taken aback. They delved deeper, concentrating on GPA, and conducted interviews with 40 families. The problem wasn't merely data or computational limitations. Life is intricate; certain aspects cannot be predicted.

Two primary errors were identified:
1. **Irreducible error**: Unforeseen events, such as a parent's death, cannot be anticipated.
2. **Learning error**: Algorithms can misinterpret patterns when dealing with too many variables.

Qualitative research, such as interviews, provided insights overlooked by numerical data. For instance, Bella, a stable child, encountered academic difficulties following her father's death and her mother's depression.

The study indicates that not all outcomes are predictable, even with increased data and computational capabilities. Social outcomes continue to be unpredictable and complex. We must acknowledge this unpredictability.

Sales of $100 million homes are set to double this year. The ultra-luxury real estate market is booming, driven by surging financial markets and hopes for rate cuts. Six homes in the U.S. have already sold for over $100 million as of July 15. If this pace continues, it will more than double last year's total and likely surpass the record of nine homes sold in 2021.

Manhattan saw two blockbuster deals recently. A penthouse at Central Park Tower sold for $115 million. Another penthouse at the Aman New York went for $135 million to a Russian-born billionaire. Palm Beach's Tarpon Island fetched $150 million in May. A Malibu mansion sold for $210 million, the most expensive home ever sold in California.

Even San Francisco is seeing ultra-luxury activity. Laurene Powell Jobs, the billionaire widow of Steve Jobs, bought the most expensive home ever sold in the city for $70 million.

Sales of homes priced at $5 million or more are up 13% compared to last year. High-end markets in Naples, Florida, and Montana are also seeing strong demand. The artificial intelligence boom has boosted sales in the San Francisco Bay area.

The ultra-luxury market is largely disconnected from the broader housing market. It's driven by global financial markets and the stock market's continued success. The surge in inheritances from the $80 trillion Great Wealth Transfer is also helping sales. Millennial and Gen Z buyers are purchasing condos with family trusts, often sight unseen.

Wealthy buyers now want all their favorite lifestyle amenities in their homes. This includes gyms, spas, offices, entertainment spaces, and displays for their art and car collections. The price per square foot for luxury condos in South Florida is up 33% this year, to $3,451. Per-square-foot prices for single-family homes are up 11% to $2,485.

Scientists have solved a longstanding issue in material design: the absence of a mathematical foundation for three-dimensional conformal methods. A team led by Professors Qiu Chengwei from the National University of Singapore and Huang Jiping from Fudan University has developed a new technique called Conformality-Assisted Tracing (CAT).

CAT enables the precise and efficient design of complex 3D structures, surpassing previous geometric limitations. It operates by constructing a 3D grid using heat flow lines and isotherms, circumventing the problem of lacking a mathematical representation for 3D coordinates.

This method is not limited to heat; it can also handle optical and other wave systems. It is faster and more accurate than traditional methods, marking a significant advancement in the design of metamaterials used in stealth technology and other cutting-edge applications.

The team is now exploring the expansion of CAT's applications to fluid dynamics and elasticity, with the goal of addressing challenges such as chip cooling and aircraft insulation. They are also investigating the use of quaternions to extend material parameter design into spacetime dimensions.

In 2035, robots like the NS-5 from "I, Robot" will slice vegetables faster than seasoned chefs. However, in 2024, most people haven't tasted meals cooked by robots. Some robots, though, operate invisibly in industrial kitchens, preparing mass-produced foods for supermarkets and airlines.

Chef Robotics, a startup, employs AI-driven arms to handle a variety of foods, from Indian curry to Italian pasta. These robots never tire, reduce waste, and handle portions precisely, unlike human cooks. They adapt to various containers and speeds, using different tools for different sizes.

Chef Robotics doesn't sell robots but offers services under a Robot as a Service (RaaS) model. They have produced 20 million meals in two years, deployed in six cities. Humans still input orders and assist, but the vision is clear: robots handle the bulk, humans oversee.

Sweetgreen uses salad-making robots, speeding up service but still requiring human oversight and cleanup. Chipotle tests robots for tasks like making chips and slicing avocados, though challenges like maintenance persist.

Stanford's ALOHA robot can cook complex dishes but needs human guidance. Meanwhile, AI-powered "美膳狮" from 橡鹿科技 aims to standardize Chinese cuisine, promising chef-like results with less human intervention.

The takeaway? Robots enhance efficiency but don't fully replace humans. They standardize processes, ensuring consistency and freeing humans for more complex tasks. The future of dining might be automated, but human touch remains crucial.
