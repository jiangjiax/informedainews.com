# World News Daily(2024-08-07) : Massive Data Breach at Background Check Firm NPD Affects 29 Billion Records

## Massive Data Breach at Background Check Firm NPD Affects 29 Billion Records

National Public Data, a background check firm, suffered a cyber-attack in April. The breach exposed 29 billion personal records, making it the second-largest data leak in history. Leaked details include social security numbers, names, and addresses. The hacker, USDoD, is selling this data on underground forums. Christopher Hofmann has filed a class-action lawsuit against the company, seeking damages and corrective actions.

Background check firms like National Public Data gather personal information from non-public sources to verify identities. This incident underscores the vulnerability of such data and the potential for widespread misuse.

### Secretaries of State Demand X to Address Grok Chatbot's Election Misinformation

Secretaries of state from five states penned an open letter to Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, and X (formerly Twitter). They demanded immediate changes to X’s AI chatbot, Grok, which spread false claims about Vice President Kamala Harris’s eligibility for the 2024 presidential ballot.

Grok, available only to X Premium subscribers, incorrectly stated that ballot deadlines had passed in nine states. This misinformation circulated widely before being corrected ten days later.

The letter, signed by secretaries from Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Washington, Michigan, and New Mexico, highlighted the urgency of ensuring accurate election information.

Musk’s handling of political content on X has been criticized. Data shows X has fewer moderation staff than other platforms, a result of significant layoffs. Despite promises of a new trust and safety center, X hired far fewer moderators than projected.

Musk’s personal contributions to misinformation include sharing a video using AI to clone Harris’s voice, making false statements about her capabilities. His posts on civil war and riots in the U.K. have also drawn criticism.

In a critical election year, the integrity of information is paramount. The actions of platform leaders and the accuracy of AI tools are under intense scrutiny.

The World Health Organization has warned of the global spread of highly virulent Klebsiella pneumoniae, with at least 16 countries reporting its presence. The bacteria are highly resistant to drugs and can rapidly cause severe infections, even fatal ones. The scientific community has not yet fully understood its pathogenic mechanisms.

This bacterium can lead to various diseases such as pneumonia and meningitis, with highly virulent strains posing an even greater threat. ST23 strains, detected in 12 countries, are resistant to all β-lactam antibiotics. Treatment options are limited.

The WHO calls for enhanced cooperation, improved detection capabilities, understanding of epidemic dynamics, and the development of prevention strategies. Additionally, antibiotics should be used rationally to slow the development of resistance.

  alt="Google Antitrust Verdict Impacts Apple's Revenue, Highlighting the Importance of AI Transformation"

The court ruled that Google violated antitrust laws by paying Apple a substantial fee to ensure that Google became the default search engine for Safari. This fee has skyrocketed to over $20 billion in recent years.

Although the ruling targets Google, it significantly impacts Apple. With annual revenues exceeding $380 billion and a net profit of about $100 billion, losing this "passive income" is a heavy blow to Apple.

However, Apple is transitioning to AI, launching the "Apple Intelligence" suite, which integrates AI chatbots into software like Siri. This move opens up new revenue streams for Apple in the post-search engine era.

Apple has partnered with OpenAI, where users subscribing to ChatGPT membership result in OpenAI returning commissions to Apple. Apple is expected to reach new agreements with AI companies to avoid monopolistic accusations.

The court plans to discuss how to lift the monopoly status next month. It may require Apple to change default settings to create a fair competitive environment. Apple devices might emulate the EU by displaying multiple search engine options when the browser is first opened.

Apple anticipates that the Intelligence suite will change how users interact with their devices. Siri is being upgraded to facilitate users in making inquiries to AI across various devices.

The U.S. is providing SK Hynix with $450 million for a new chip plant in Indiana, which will produce specialized chips for AI, similar to those used in Nvidia's graphics cards. SK Hynix intends to invest $3.87 billion in the project.

In addition to the grant, the U.S. government is offering $500 million in loans and a 25% tax break. This new facility is expected to create 1,000 jobs and bolster the U.S.'s competitiveness in the global chip market.

Last year, Congress approved a $39 billion subsidy for U.S. chip manufacturers. The Commerce Department has already allocated $30 billion to 15 companies, which is anticipated to draw $300 billion in private investment.

All five major chip manufacturers—TSMC, Intel, Samsung, Micron, and SK Hynix—are now establishing operations in the U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo believes this will make the U.S. supply chain for advanced chips the most secure globally.

SK Hynix CEO Kwak Noh-Jung expressed appreciation for the support and enthusiasm for the project. The U.S. is also providing $75 million to Absolics for a materials plant in Georgia, which is vital for the semiconductor industry.

Bitcoin and ether rebounded after a sharp decline. Over $370 billion was wiped out from cryptocurrency market caps in just one day. Bitcoin fell below $50,000, and ether experienced its steepest drop in three years.

The sell-off reflected a broader slump in the stock market. New spot cryptocurrency ETFs, introduced this year, have increased exposure to crypto volatility for more investors. Despite the downturn, ETF holders largely remained invested. Bitcoin ETFs saw outflows of $168 million, a minor portion of their $50 billion market cap. Ether ETFs, however, attracted over $48 million.

Analysts at Bernstein emphasize the liquidity of bitcoin ETFs, which trade around $2 billion daily. They anticipate further approvals in the third and fourth quarters, which could enhance bitcoin investment.

Morgan Stanley plans to allow its advisors to recommend BlackRock and Fidelity's spot bitcoin ETFs to high-net-worth clients. This move could encourage more firms to do the same, driven by market demand.

Jenny Johnson, CEO of Franklin Templeton, expects larger institutions to participate once they are comfortable with the settlement processes. Bernstein analysts predict that cryptocurrency will respond to macroeconomic and election events in the third quarter.

Barclays points out that ETF trading volumes remain lower than those on cryptocurrency exchanges.

### Microplastics Discovered in Human Bone Marrow

Researchers discovered microplastics in human bone marrow. These minute plastic particles originate from common items such as bags and toys. They are pervasive, even within our bodies. This finding, led by Zhang Shao-kai at Henan Cancer Hospital, implies that these plastics could elevate the risk of blood cancers.

The study employed advanced techniques such as Py-GC/MS and LD-IR to detect and analyze these microplastics. It revealed an average concentration of 51.29 µg/g of microplastics in the bone marrow samples, with polyethylene and polystyrene being the most prevalent types.

This research marks the first to provide evidence of microplastic accumulation in human bone marrow, paving the way for understanding how these plastics may affect our blood-forming systems.

The results underscore the necessity to curtail plastic usage and pollution. Simple measures, such as avoiding single-use plastics, can contribute to safeguarding our health.

Microplastics: Tiny plastic fragments, often less than 5mm, resulting from the breakdown of larger plastic items.

Py-GC/MS: A method combining pyrolysis (heating to break down substances), gas chromatography, and mass spectrometry to analyze complex materials.

LD-IR: Laser diode infrared imaging, used to identify and map the distribution of specific substances.
