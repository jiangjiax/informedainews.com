# World News Daily(2024-07-21) : UN Court Rules Israeli Occupation of Palestinian Territories Illegal

## UN Court Rules Israeli Occupation of Palestinian Territories Illegal

The UN's top court declares Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories illegal. The ICJ, based in The Hague, states that settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem are unlawful. Israel must end the occupation and remove settlers. Prime Minister Netanyahu calls the decision "a lie."

The ICJ's opinion, though not binding, carries significant political weight. This is the first time the court has addressed the 57-year occupation. Israel disputes the legality of the settlements. The court finds that Israel's control over Gaza persists despite the 2005 withdrawal.

Israel has built 160 settlements since 1967, housing 700,000 Jews. The ICJ labels these annexations as against international law. The court also criticizes Israel's exploitation of Palestinian resources and systemic discrimination.

Palestinians welcome the ICJ's ruling. PLO's Hussein Al Sheikh calls it a "historic victory." The decision now goes to the UN General Assembly, which may adopt a resolution, potentially catalyzing negotiations.

This ruling is separate from South Africa's ongoing case at the ICJ, accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza.

US plans to station missiles in Germany worry Russia. Moscow vows to respond, eyeing new missile placements in Kaliningrad, Belarus, and the Far East. This could target Alaska and parts of the US.

Swedish observer Mikael Valtersson suggests Russia might also deploy missiles near US allies in North Africa or the Caribbean. He warns of increased tensions and the risk of hasty decisions due to shorter missile flight times.

The situation echoes the 1980s Euromissiles crisis, sparking protests and near-accidental nuclear war. Germany's defense minister dismisses comparisons, but tensions remain high.

Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister, Sergei Ryabkov, promises necessary measures. The US exited the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 2019, allowing these deployments.

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists recently adjusted the Doomsday Clock closer to midnight, highlighting global nuclear tension.

Xie Fan, a native of Shaodong, Hunan, holds a bachelor's degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology and a doctorate from the University of Alberta in Canada. He completed his postdoctoral research at the German Electron Synchrotron Research Institute. Recently, he published a paper in _Science_, which was a collaboration of only three authors, using tap water to complete the experiment. The paper proposes a new microscopic mechanism for the formation of hydrochloric acid by the dissolution of hydrogen chloride, solving a chemical puzzle that has persisted for decades.

Xie Fan's research focuses on the aggregation and growth processes of molecular clusters, deducing the microscopic mechanisms of macroscopic properties of substances through experimental observations. He used supersonic expansion technology to cool and separate hydrochloric acid-water clusters in a vacuum, obtaining rotational spectral fingerprints through microwave radiation, which revealed the mechanism of hydrogen chloride molecule dissociation under the influence of five water molecules.

This discovery not only corrects previous research directions but also provides new insights for chemistry, physics, and materials science. Xie Fan's research methods and achievements herald a broad prospect for the industrialization and commercialization of microwave spectroscopy instruments, while also emphasizing the importance of localization.

Xie Fan's research not only solves fundamental chemical problems but also provides a scientific basis for atmospheric chemistry, astrochemistry, material design, and environmental protection. His work demonstrates the role of basic scientific research in driving multidisciplinary development.

### North America's EV Battery Factory Boom

The boom in EV battery factories in North America surged post-COVID. From just two U.S. factories in 2019, now 34 are planned, under construction, or operational. President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act accelerated this trend, incentivizing domestic battery production and sparking a tech race with the EU.

China's dominance in lithium-ion batteries is waning as automakers shift production closer to home, wary of supply chain disruptions. The IRA offers tax credits for EVs meeting strict battery sourcing guidelines, aiming to halve U.S. reliance on China by 2030.

Automakers and battery makers have pledged $112 billion for domestic production, promising nearly 1,200 gigawatt-hours of annual capacity by 2030. This could power 18 million EVs.

Key players like BMW, Ford, General Motors, and Hyundai are investing heavily in U.S. and Canadian battery plants, driven by IRA incentives and a strategic pivot away from Chinese supply chains.

### "China's Rapid Expansion in Renewable Energy"

China's push for clean energy is massive. They are adding renewables at a rate equivalent to constructing five large nuclear plants weekly. A Sydney-based think tank, CEF, predicts they will reach their 2030 target six years early.

China is installing 10 gigawatts of wind and solar power every two weeks, a significant achievement. With China accounting for a third of the world's total emissions, these levels might have already peaked. Their power grid is transitioning to green energy, thanks to extensive solar and wind farms in the west, connected to the east via long transmission lines.

Interestingly, China continues to build coal plants. Last year, they accounted for 95% of the world's new coal plant construction. These plants serve to balance the grid, supporting the intermittent nature of wind and solar power.

However, the role of coal in China's power mix is diminishing. Renewables could surpass coal this year. While China added only 1 gigawatt of nuclear power last year, compared to 300 gigawatts of solar and wind, they are lagging in nuclear but leading in renewables.

Despite soaring electricity demand, renewables will meet this growth. Coal power will gradually decline as renewables and nuclear power expand. The EU leads in reducing CO2 intensity from power generation, with China closely following.

### Round One Arcade Expands in U.S. Market

Round One, a Japanese arcade operator, is doubling down on U.S. expansion. They opened their first standalone arcade in Las Vegas this April, featuring 150 claw machines across 2,000 sq. meters. Plans are to open two more arcades in fiscal 2024 and expand to 100 by 2032.

This growth strategy complements their existing hybrid bowling alleys, which also include billiards and arcade games. Round One aims to double these hybrid locations to 100 by 2032, investing 100 billion yen ($635 million) to quadruple their U.S. presence to 200 locations.

The U.S. market is proving more profitable for Round One, with a 19% operating margin compared to 14% in Japan. Their U.S. operating profit is projected to surpass Japan's by fiscal 2025.

Round One's stock has risen about 10% since announcing their U.S. expansion in early June. Analysts see this move as a positive sign for the market.

The company leverages its expertise in claw machines, capitalizing on the growing demand for Japanese character goods in the U.S. They also adopt cashless payments, allowing dynamic pricing based on game popularity.

Round One's expansion is facilitated by available U.S. real estate, particularly spaces vacated by struggling retail chains like Sears and Macy's.

Despite their success, Round One's stock price remains below its 2006 peak, reflecting a slower pace of growth compared to competitors like Genda, which uses mergers and acquisitions to build scale.

Analysts believe Round One is undervalued and expect earnings to rise from fiscal 2026, driven by reduced depreciation charges.

Exa, a San Francisco-based AI lab, has raised $22 million to develop a new AI-focused search engine. Led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, with NVIDIA and Y Combinator also investing.

Exa's founders, Will Bryk and Jeff Wang, both in their mid-20s, started the company before ChatGPT's launch. They aim to improve search by focusing on links rather than keywords, using vector databases and embedding technology.

The company initially offered a free version and various paid tiers, hosting on AWS. Post-ChatGPT, many AI firms sought Exa's API for integrating with their models.

Exa's search differs from traditional methods by predicting links instead of words, reducing clutter and irrelevant content. It categorizes results by type, such as PDFs or company sites, enhancing specificity.

While effective for tech-savvy users, Exa's search lacks direct answers, requiring manual filtering. It excels in indexing but sometimes includes inaccurate or outdated information.

Perplexity, another AI search tool, offers a more user-friendly, question-and-answer format, contrasting Exa's technical approach.

Embedding technology, used by Exa, converts words into numerical vectors, aiding machine understanding. This differs from models like GPT-4, which generate content directly.

Exa serves as a data intermediary for AI systems, focusing on deep data integration, while Perplexity caters to general users with immediate, concise answers.

Overall, Exa's innovative approach to search, though complex, could revolutionize how AI interacts with web data, especially in specialized, technical contexts.

The news of the seventh global patient cured of HIV has sparked heated discussions. A 60-year-old German man, who underwent a stem cell transplant in 2015, has remained asymptomatic and has tested negative for the virus since. Prior to this, there have been six similar cases of cure.

The key lies in the transplanted stem cells containing a CCR5 gene mutation, which provides resistance to HIV. CCR5 is the main receptor through which the virus enters cells; with the mutation, the virus cannot enter cells, thereby blocking infection and replication.

However, not all transplants are successful, and there are issues with individual differences and scarce donors. Experts believe that a functional cure, where the viral load is so low that it cannot be detected, is a more promising goal.

In the future, research will focus on immunotherapy and gene therapy, such as CAR-T cell therapy, which has shown potential in clinical trials.

HIV remains a significant global public health challenge, and prevention remains the best method of control.

### FGM Survivor Undergoes Reconstructive Surgery for Clitoral Regeneration

Shamsa Sharawe, a Somali FGM survivor, chose reconstructive surgery to regain her clitoris. FGM, or female genital mutilation, involves cutting off parts of a girl's genitalia. In Shamsa's case, this happened when she was six. She used a rose to show the damage in a viral TikTok video.

FGM is a deep-rooted practice in Somali culture, believed to preserve virginity. Those who avoid it face stigma, seen as promiscuous. Shamsa, now 31, moved to the UK in 2001. She faced forced marriage and rape in Somalia at 18.

Reconstructive surgery isn't covered by the UK's NHS. Shamsa learned about it from Haja Bilkisu, another FGM survivor. She raised £25,000 online for the procedure in Germany. The surgery, done by Dr. Dan mon O’Dey, used tissue from her buttocks to rebuild her clitoris and labia.

Shamsa's journey highlights the ongoing struggle against FGM. Her story offers hope and options to others. Despite the physical and financial toll, she feels a sense of completeness and empowerment.

Chef Robotics, a startup in San Francisco, has developed an AI-powered robotic arm system that can be programmed with recipes to accurately measure ingredients and sauces. Following successful trials with brands like Amy's Kitchen, the company is expanding its deployment.

Previously, robots struggled with the variety and flexibility required in food packaging. However, advancements in AI have enhanced robots' adaptability, enabling them to distinguish between tasks such as scooping peas and cauliflower. This adaptability reduces waste and labor costs, making robotic packaging more economical.

Chef Robotics offers its system as a service, charging an annual fee that includes maintenance and training. At Amy's Kitchen, these robots have replaced human labor in some tasks, reducing costs and improving precision.

The CEO of Chef Robotics, Rajat Bhageria, estimates the annual cost of a single-arm system at under $135,000. This investment is justified by the efficiency and cost savings the robots provide.

Despite these advancements, challenges remain. For instance, maintaining the artisanal look of hand-packaged foods is tricky. Amy's Kitchen faced this issue with their cheese enchilada, where the robot-packaged cheese lacked the human touch.

Overall, AI-driven robots are poised to transform food packaging, offering efficiency and consistency. However, the balance between automation and maintaining human-like qualities in packaged foods remains a challenge.

Miho Fujita, president of Mioya Shuzo, faced a 7.6-magnitude earthquake in Ishikawa, Japan, on January 1, 2024. The quake shattered many bottles at her sake brewery. Despite initial fears, most bottles survived, and production resumed quickly due to access to well water.

Fujita, a pioneer in the male-dominated sake industry, left a successful marketing career at Mattel to take over her father's struggling brewery in 2003. Her transition was challenging, but she learned every aspect of sake making.

Toshiaki Yokomichi, her master brewer, also switched careers midlife, bringing expertise from Osaka's Daimon Shuzo. Together, they rebuilt Mioya Shuzo, now a successful brand in Japan and abroad.
