### France Launches Mobile Phone Ban Trial in Schools for Under-15s

France plans to implement a mobile phone ban in 197 schools for children under 15, requiring phones to be handed in at reception. This trial, aimed at creating a "digital pause," builds on a 2018 law that only restricted phone use, not possession. If successful, the ban will be extended nationwide in January.

A presidential commission has warned about the detrimental effects of screen time on children's health and development. Their report links digital devices to issues such as sleep disturbances, sedentary habits, and obesity.

U.N. urges China to review Xinjiang policies. Two years after a critical report, the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights calls for a full review of laws and policies in Xinjiang, citing ongoing human rights concerns.

The U.N. team discussed China’s criminal justice system and policies, sparking allegations of abuses against Uyghurs and Tibetans. Ravina Shamdasani, spokesperson for the human rights office, highlighted the need for a human rights perspective on national security and counterterrorism laws, and stronger protection against discrimination for minorities.

Allegations of torture and human rights violations require thorough investigation. The U.N. faces challenges monitoring the situation due to limited access and fear of reprisals.

Rights groups accuse Beijing of detaining and abusing Uyghurs and other Turkic-Muslim minorities, including forced labor and internment camps. Beijing denies these allegations, framing the programs as anti-terrorism measures.

Rayhan Asat, a human rights lawyer, praised U.N. rights Commissioner Volker Turk for his commitment but noted little progress since the 2022 report. The report concluded that China’s treatment of Uyghurs may constitute crimes against humanity. Despite Chinese pressure, the U.N. Human Rights Council narrowly voted against debating the report.

Other U.N. expert committees also allege rights abuses. A recent U.N. review found Beijing increasingly rejecting recommendations and limiting access to Xinjiang.

Swiss researchers at EPFL have developed a tiny brain-machine interface (BMI) chip, smaller and more efficient than Elon Musk's Neuralink. This micro BMI (MiBMI) measures just 8 square millimeters, contrasting with Neuralink's 23 x 8 millimeters. It's designed to read brain activity and convert it into text on a screen.

The MiBMI operates with minimal power, is minimally invasive, and processes data in real-time. Unlike Neuralink, which requires 64 electrodes and external processing, the MiBMI uses a compact, integrated system.

Key to its success is a unique neural code (DNC) system that simplifies data. Instead of processing thousands of bytes per letter, it handles just 100 bytes per DNC, a shorthand for each letter. This innovation boosts efficiency and reduces training time for users.

Currently, the MiBMI decodes 31 characters, a record for integrated systems, with potential to expand to 100. It aims to aid communication for those with severe motor disabilities, like ALS patients.

Researchers are also exploring its use in speech decoding and movement control, aiming for a versatile BMI tailored to various neurological conditions.

The breakthrough is detailed in the IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits.
