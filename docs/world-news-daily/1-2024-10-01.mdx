The far-right Freedom party (FPÖ) won Austria’s parliamentary elections, securing 29.1% of the vote. This marks the first time since World War II that a far-right party has led in Austria. The FPÖ, known for its hardline stance on immigration and anti-EU rhetoric, capitalized on public discontent over migration, inflation, and economic stagnation.

The ruling centre-right People’s party (ÖVP) came in second with 26.2%, while the Social Democratic party had its worst performance at 20.4%. The Greens, despite the recent climate crisis, garnered only 8.6%.

FPÖ’s success reflects a broader rightward shift in Europe, modeled after Hungary’s Viktor Orbán. The party’s leader, Herbert Kickl, a former interior minister, campaigned on deporting “undesirable” immigrants and opposing EU sanctions against Russia.

The ÖVP, though defeated, remains a potential coalition partner for the FPÖ. However, Chancellor Karl Nehammer has ruled out Kickl as a chancellor candidate, setting the stage for complex negotiations.

This election underscores Austria’s shifting political landscape and the growing influence of far-right ideologies in Europe.

### October: High-Risk Month for U.S. Election Interference

October is crunchtime for U.S. elections, a month ripe for foreign mischief. Federal officials warn of heightened risks, with time to react running short.

Russia openly backs Trump, while Iran, Moscow’s ally in Ukraine, hacks Trump’s campaign to thwart his return. The Justice Department is set to indict an Iranian hacking group linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

China, uncertain about its stance, focuses on local races to undermine public faith in the democratic process.

Intelligence briefings reveal a complex battlefield. Russia remains the most active threat, but Iran’s counter-efforts and China’s muddled position add new dimensions.

Election officials fear cyberattacks could lock up registration systems, skewing results or giving pro-Trump officials an excuse not to certify votes.

The U.S. government is more proactive this year, warning the public of potential threats to bolster election security.

Jen Easterly, head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, emphasizes the common goal of foreign adversaries: undermining American confidence in election security and sowing partisan discord.

A South Korean court sentenced three police officers to prison for their role in the 2022 Itaewon crowd crush, which killed 159 people. The officers, including the former chief of Seoul’s Yongsan police station, were convicted of professional negligence resulting in death. The court found their inadequate preparation and response exacerbated the disaster.

The crush occurred during Halloween celebrations in Itaewon, a popular nightlife district. The court ruled it was preventable, criticizing the officers for failing to alert others of the danger and supervise effectively. The police officers and prosecutors can appeal the verdict.

In contrast, the court acquitted the head of the Yongsan ward office and three other officials, stating they lacked legal authority to control the crowd. Bereaved families criticized this decision, questioning its logic.

A 2023 special investigation revealed police and municipal officials had anticipated large crowds but failed to implement effective control measures. The investigation also noted police ignored warnings from pedestrians about the swelling crowd before the fatal surge.

This case highlights the critical need for effective crowd management and the accountability of authorities in preventing such tragedies.

  alt="Japan's Thriving M&A Market: Key Drivers and Global Implications"
/>

Japan's M&A market is booming, making it Asia's most important. David Hill, Deloitte Asia Pacific's CEO, credits this to yen depreciation and government reforms. Historically, Japan focused on outbound deals; now, foreign investors are eyeing domestic opportunities.

Corporate governance reforms, like requiring boards to consider unsolicited bids, are driving this shift. Hill expects significant investment activity, both inbound and outbound.

Global M&A markets are recovering, with $1.3 trillion in deals in the first half of 2024. Megadeals over $5 billion are up 21%, signaling economic confidence.

Tokyo Stock Exchange reforms and government pressure on corporate efficiency are also factors. Shareholder activism, particularly in Japan, is on the rise, with 38 campaigns in the first half of 2024.

A vast amount of "dry powder"—$4.4 trillion in corporate cash reserves and $3 trillion in private equity—is fueling M&A activity. Environmental, social, and governance concerns are reshaping sectors like energy and industrials.

Despite optimism, geopolitical tensions pose risks. Australia, for instance, has restricted Chinese investment in critical minerals.

In summary, Japan's M&A market is thriving due to reforms, investor interest, and ample capital. However, geopolitical risks remain a significant concern.

Oasis, the band of the Gallagher brothers, is back. Their 2025 tour will hit the US, Canada, and Mexico. After teasing fans with billboards, they've confirmed the dates: Toronto on August 24, Chicago on August 28, New Jersey on August 31, Los Angeles on September 6, and Mexico City on September 12. Cage the Elephant will be the opening act.

This tour marks their first in these regions since 2008. Their 1994-95 American debut was chaotic, with Noel Gallagher briefly quitting after a drunken show in LA.

The band's already sold-out UK and Ireland dates have added five more shows due to high demand. Initial ticket sales were marred by technical issues and high prices, leading to two new Wembley Stadium shows via a ballot.

Dynamic pricing, where ticket prices fluctuate based on demand, caused uproar. Oasis claimed ignorance, blaming promoters. The government plans to review this practice. Consumer groups want refunds for overcharged fans.

Ticketmaster defends dynamic pricing, saying it deters scalpers. Liam Gallagher dismissed critics, telling one to "shut up" and another to buy "kneeling tickets."

**Dynamic pricing**: A method where ticket prices change based on demand, often leading to higher prices as demand increases.

Researchers have identified a potential "pause button" in human embryonic development. This mechanism, similar to the dormant state observed in some animals, could delay embryo growth. The study, published in *Cell*, utilized human stem cells and embryoid models to investigate the mTOR signaling pathway. Inhibiting mTOR triggered a dormant state, marked by slowed cell division and reduced attachment to the uterine wall.

This dormant state is reversible and seems to be confined to early embryonic stages. The researchers propose that humans may retain an evolutionary remnant of this ability, even if it is not naturally employed during pregnancy.

The findings could influence reproductive technologies such as IVF. Accelerating embryo development through mTOR activation might enhance IVF success rates, while inducing dormancy could offer more time to evaluate embryo health and improve implantation.

In essence, this research reveals a previously unrecognized facet of human development, potentially paving the way for advancements in reproductive health.

Researchers from the California Institute of Technology and the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California have developed a laser-based wearable device capable of non-invasively and in real-time identifying stroke risk. The device uses infrared lasers to pass through the skull, monitoring changes in cerebral blood flow, and analyzes the blood flow velocity using a speckle contrast optical spectroscopy (SCOS) system.

The study recruited 50 participants, divided into high-risk and low-risk groups. The device analyzed cerebral blood flow and volume while participants held their breath, revealing significant differences between the two groups. Professor Chonghuai Yang of the California Institute of Technology noted that SCOS can measure the degree of vascular dilation and blood flow velocity, reflecting vascular stiffness, a unique non-invasive measurement capability of transcranial optical methods.

The research team is exploring the application of machine learning in data analysis and plans to conduct long-term clinical trials. Charles Liu of the University of Southern California believes that the technology has the potential to be included in annual physical examinations, providing doctors with important health information, particularly beneficial for communities with limited medical resources.

This research was published in the journal Biomedical Optics Express, showcasing the potential of laser technology in medical diagnostics and potentially bringing revolutionary changes to stroke risk assessment.

Milan police arrested 19 people linked to football ultras, mostly accused of mafia ties. Among them, Luca Lucci and Renato Bosetti, leaders of AC Milan and Inter Milan ultras, respectively. Lucci, previously convicted on drug charges, was seen shaking hands with Matteo Salvini, Italy’s deputy prime minister.

The investigation began after Antonio Bellocco, a powerful ’Ndrangheta member, was murdered in September. Bellocco’s close associate, Marco Ferdico, was also arrested, along with Alex Cologno and Christian Rosiello, described as rapper Fedez’s “friends and bodyguards.”

Charges include criminal conspiracy, extortion, assault, and other serious crimes. Milan prosecutor Marcello Viola called it a “complex investigation” involving various police branches. He noted illicit activities at San Siro stadium were “beyond control,” partly due to management shortcomings.

AC Milan and Inter Milan fans made a “non-belligerence” agreement in 1981 after a fan’s death. Police say the pact evolved into a profit-driven business deal, infiltrating “every possible profitable aspect of football.” Ultras are known for their organization, violence, and racism, with leaders earning thousands monthly from illegal activities.

HungryPanda recently completed a $55 million Series D+ funding round, led by Mars Growth Capital and Liquidity Group. The funds will be used to expand into overseas markets and serve Asian and minority communities.

Founded in Nottingham, UK in 2017, HungryPanda specializes in Chinese food delivery and fresh produce distribution. It covers over 80 cities in 10 countries, with over 100,000 registered merchants, 80,000 delivery riders, and 6.5 million global users.

The platform employs crowdsourced delivery and shares rider resources with Uber Eats. It has developed an intelligent dispatch system for flexible order allocation.

Recognizing the immature delivery services for overseas Chinese restaurants, HungryPanda provides packaging materials compliant with local regulations to enhance service quality.

In 2022, it launched fresh produce delivery services, with central warehouses and front-store facilities in the UK, offering delivery within three hours.

HungryPanda has expanded to 10 countries, with GMV growth in North America exceeding 55%. It is expected to surpass $1 billion in annual revenue this year.

The platform offers multiple language versions to serve different ethnic groups. It plans to cover more minority communities, penetrate second and third-tier cities, and expand its B2B fresh ingredient supply.

The founding team consists of UK alumni with entrepreneurial experience. The brand initially started as a campus incubation project.

Extreme weather has wreaked havoc globally, from Asia to the Americas, with droughts, heavy rains, and wildfires wreaking havoc on crop yields. Major agricultural commodity prices have surged in response, with the Bloomberg Agriculture Spot Index rising about 7% in September, marking its largest monthly gain since the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

Farmers in Brazil, Vietnam, Australia, and other regions are grappling with floods or droughts, affecting the production of sugar, grains, coffee, and other crops. Michael Whitehead, an agricultural director at ANZ Bank, noted that adverse weather conditions are driving up food prices due to increased supply uncertainties.

Chicago wheat futures have surged, with Australian wheat threatened by drought and frost, and insufficient rainfall in the Black Sea region. Soybean futures have seen their biggest two-year gain, as Brazil faces its worst drought in decades. Sugar futures have risen nearly 17%, and Arabica coffee prices have reached their highest level since 2011.

Droughts and heavy rains in Vietnam have impacted coffee production, while palm oil supplies in Southeast Asia have tightened, pushing futures prices to a five-month high. Hedge funds are betting on rising sugar and cocoa prices. JPMorgan has warned that ongoing droughts in northern and central Brazil pose a continued threat to crop yields.

Traders are monitoring the tense situation in the Middle East and the Black Sea, as well as the impact of the U.S. election on Sino-U.S. trade relations. The market is sensitive to volatility, with weather and political conditions both influencing food prices.

**Brief Analysis:**

The combination of extreme weather and geopolitical risks poses a severe challenge to the global food supply chain. Rising food prices are putting pressure on consumers, increasing the cost of living. Addressing climate change and stabilizing international relations are key to ensuring global food security.
