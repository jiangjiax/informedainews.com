US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that Russia has received new ballistic missiles from Iran, likely to be used in Ukraine. This marks the first US confirmation of such a transfer. The missiles, Fateh-360, have a range of 19 to 75 miles and can travel at Mach 3.

The news prompted new sanctions on Iran from the US and Europe, complicating any potential rapprochement with the West. It also raised questions about US restrictions on Ukraine using British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles to strike deep within Russia.

Blinken highlighted concerns over Ukraine's ability to maintain and strategically use these missiles. The debate centers on whether allowing such strikes would dangerously escalate the conflict.

Ukraine, with UK backing, seeks permission to strike deeper into Russia. US President Joe Biden has allowed limited cross-border strikes for self-defense.

The issue is expected to be discussed further when UK leader Keir Starmer meets Biden in Washington. Germany, under pressure, called for a peace conference, but Blinken's revelation may shift the debate.

Germany, France, and the UK condemned Iran's decision, announcing sanctions including banning Iran's civilian airline from Europe.

Iran denied providing the missiles, calling such actions inhumane. CIA Director William Burns said the missiles, if used, would be identifiable.

The UK and US aim to hear directly from Ukrainian leadership about their needs and strategic objectives. The situation remains tense, with ongoing concerns about escalation and European security.

Jakarta, Indonesia’s sprawling capital, broke ground on its second subway line, the East-West MRT, on September 11, 2024. President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, aims to alleviate the city’s crippling traffic congestion and foster suburban development. The new line, stretching 84 kilometers, will connect Cikarang in West Java to Balaraja in Banten.

Phase 1, covering 24.5 kilometers, begins in 2025 and is slated for completion by 2031. Japan, a key partner, has pledged a $982 million loan and will supply technology for the rolling stock and signal systems. Ambassador Yasushi Masaki views the MRT as a symbol of economic partnership between Indonesia and Japan.

Jakarta, home to over 10 million, suffers from inadequate public transport. Motorbikes dominate, exacerbating air pollution. The World Bank estimates traffic congestion costs Indonesia $5.6 billion annually, equivalent to 0.5% of GDP. Jokowi has prioritized public transport infrastructure since taking office in 2014.

Beyond the East-West Line, Indonesia is extending the existing North-South Line with Japan’s aid. A 5.8-kilometer extension is due in 2030. Additionally, Indonesia launched Southeast Asia’s first bullet train, connecting Jakarta and Bandung, with Chinese support.

The new MRT line is a bold step toward modernizing Jakarta’s transport system, aiming to make the city more livable and globally competitive.

### Antarctic Sea Ice Nears Second Consecutive Winter Record Low

<img

Antarctic sea ice is on the brink of a second consecutive winter record low. In 2023, the ice cover shrank by 1.6 million square kilometers—an area larger than Britain, France, Germany, and Spain combined. This year, the trend continues, with ice extent already below last year’s levels.

Dr. Will Hobbs, a sea ice researcher, calls these events “incredible extreme.” He notes that warmer Southern Ocean temperatures, driven by global warming, are the main culprit. Global temperatures have been more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels for extended periods.

On September 7, Southern Ocean sea ice covered 17 million square kilometers, less than the previous low of 17.1 million square kilometers in 2023. The long-term average for that date is 18.4 million square kilometers.

While sea ice loss doesn’t directly raise sea levels, it has indirect impacts. It removes a protective barrier, accelerating glacial ice loss and ocean warming. Exposed dark waters absorb more heat, further destabilizing the Antarctic environment.

Scientists warn that recovery could take decades, and the long-term effects of global heating are becoming clear. The Antarctic system may have shifted to a “new state,” with lasting consequences for global weather patterns and ocean health.

### China's aging population is intensifying, and experts interpret the delayed retirement policy.

China is facing the challenge of an increasingly aging population. In 2021, the proportion of the population aged 65 and above reached 14.2%, marking the stage of moderate aging. By 2035, it is projected that the number of people aged 60 and above will exceed 400 million, accounting for over 30% of the population, entering a stage of severe aging.

To address this trend, China plans to implement a gradual delay of the statutory retirement age. This move aims to release the potential of labor resources and boost productivity. Experts point out that with increased life expectancy and health levels, as well as changes in labor methods, extending working years becomes feasible.

Zhao Zhong, Dean of the School of Labor and Human Resources at Renmin University of China, stated that the increase in life expectancy means the age at which one can continue to engage in production and business activities also increases. Through institutional reforms, the country's labor force size can be expanded, which is of great significance for socio-economic development.

**Key Term Explanations:**
- **Gradual Delay of Statutory Retirement Age**: The phased and step-by-step postponement of the legal retirement age.
- **Total Factor Productivity**: A comprehensive indicator measuring production efficiency, involving labor, capital, technology, and other factors.

This reform is not only a response to demographic changes but also a strategic layout for the sustainable development of society and the economy in the future.

South Korea has uncovered evidence that mothers were coerced into giving up their children for adoption abroad, primarily to Australia, Denmark, and the United States. Known for sending at least 200,000 children overseas since the 1950s, recent allegations reveal systematic collusion among hospitals, maternity wards, and adoption agencies to force single mothers to relinquish their babies.

A government Truth and Reconciliation Commission report details coercive tactics used in welfare shelters. One mother labeled "mentally ill" for resisting separation from her child saw her parental rights waived and her baby transferred to an adoption agency.

International adoption was misunderstood; parents were misled, believing their children would return after studying abroad. Adoptees grew up hearing they were better off in Denmark than in impoverished South Korea.

Peter Møller, a South Korean adoptee and co-founder of the Danish Korean Rights Group, sees "redemption in the truth coming out." The commission recommends a formal government apology and financial compensation for victims.

During the 1970s and 1980s, under military dictatorship, South Korea's "social purification" policy led to thousands being forcibly admitted into welfare centers. The commission found rampant human rights abuses, including forced labor, beatings, and solitary confinement. Some inmates died and were buried in shallow graves or had their bodies donated to medical schools without family notification.

Sussie Brynald, another Danish adoptee, expressed anger and sadness, highlighting the system's focus on money over children's welfare.

Swedish researchers at Chalmers University have developed a "structural battery" made from carbon fiber composite. This battery not only stores energy but also serves as a load-bearing material, potentially reducing vehicle weight. The innovation could boost electric vehicle (EV) range by 70%.

Traditional EVs rely heavily on large lithium-ion batteries for long-distance travel. Chalmers' team aimed to create a battery that doubles as a structural component, reducing weight. Their carbon fiber battery, with a hardness comparable to aluminum, stores sufficient energy for commercial use.

Carbon fiber is known for its lightweight, high strength, and stiffness, making it ideal for high-performance vehicles and aerospace applications. The new battery design uses carbon fiber in both anode and cathode, eliminating the need for heavy materials like copper and conflict metals like cobalt.

The battery employs a semi-solid electrolyte, enhancing safety by reducing flammability. However, challenges remain in ensuring rapid ion movement for high-power applications.

With an energy density of 30 Wh/kg, the battery's performance is modest compared to modern EV batteries. Yet, its integration into vehicle frames could offset this by reducing overall weight and freeing up space for additional batteries.

Chalmers has partnered with venture capital firm Chalmers Ventures to commercialize this technology through a new company, Sinonus. The potential applications extend beyond EVs to lighter gadgets and even wind turbine blades.

In essence, this structural battery could revolutionize transportation and electronics by merging energy storage with structural integrity, paving the way for lighter, more efficient devices and vehicles.

### Female martial artist's harassment incident sparks social concern and discussion.

Female martial artist Ms. Xu was sexually harassed and did not fight back, leading to online backlash. Ms. Xu, a judo practitioner who has represented the national team and is now a mixed martial arts fighter, was followed and harassed by an unknown man one night. She chose to lead him to a well-lit area and call the police instead of retaliating.

Netizens questioned: "Why not fight back?" Ms. Xu explained that as a professional athlete, her strikes could be too forceful, fearing severe consequences. Self-defense is a right, not an obligation. Ms. Xu's calm decision protected herself and punished the lawbreaker.

**Self-Defense**: The law grants citizens the right to defend themselves against serious violent crimes, but exercising it is a personal choice. Ms. Xu's decision was based on rational thinking, avoiding excessive harm.

**Online Backlash**: The public should not condemn victims who do not exercise their rights. Stepping forward is bravery, but forcing others to do so is not justice. Not exercising a right is not a mistake; failing to protect that right is a dereliction of duty.

### U.S.-WADA Dispute Over Chinese Doping Escalates, Involving White House

The clash between the U.S. and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) over Chinese doping cases escalates, drawing in the Biden White House. WADA seeks to bar Dr. Rahul Gupta, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, from discussions. Critics view this as WADA’s attempt to stifle U.S. criticism and an FBI investigation.

The White House responds strongly, vowing to oppose any exclusion. WADA’s move is part of broader efforts to counter U.S. scrutiny and calls for transparency in the global antidoping system.

WADA’s refusal to share documents with U.S. Congressional committees and its lawsuit against the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency highlight ongoing tensions. The International Olympic Committee’s condition on awarding the 2034 Winter Olympics to Salt Lake City further complicates matters.

WADA’s internal leak investigation and its criticism of U.S. doping case handling add to the conflict. Dr. Gupta’s potential exclusion from WADA’s executive committee meeting in Turkey sparks further backlash.

The root of the issue lies in U.S. legislation allowing global doping case pursuit, which worries international antidoping officials. Recent incidents, like the subpoena of swimming’s governing body head, underscore these concerns.

In a recent crackdown, 44 individuals were banned for life from the Chinese football industry. This follows the arrest of 128 suspects involved in match-fixing, gambling, and bribery. The operation, led by the Ministry of Public Security, targeted 120 rigged matches across various leagues, affecting 41 teams.

**Key Points:**
- **83 professionals** (players, referees, coaches) were detained.
- **120 matches** were confirmed as rigged, spanning the Super League, First Division, Second Division, and other tournaments.
- **44 individuals** received lifetime bans, while 17 others face five-year bans.

**What is "假赌黑" (Fake, Gambling, Black)?**
- **Fake (假球)**: Manipulated matches where players intentionally lose.
- **Gambling (赌球)**: Betting on matches, often involving players fixing the outcome.
- **Black (黑哨)**: Corrupt referees influencing match results.

**Impact:**
- **Loss of integrity**: Fans lose trust in the sport.
- **Economic damage**: Sponsors and investors pull out.
- **Legal consequences**: Severe penalties for offenders.

**Hemingway's Insight:**
The crackdown is a necessary purge to restore the sport's integrity. However, it also highlights the deep-seated corruption that has plagued Chinese football. Long-term solutions require systemic changes, not just punitive measures. The sport needs transparency, robust regulations, and a culture that values fair play over short-term gains.

Amazon Fresh, the grocery chain, is back in expansion mode after a yearlong stall. The company has opened new stores in various states, including California, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. These openings follow a pause in growth as Amazon sought a store format that resonated with shoppers and was economically viable.

Amazon's grocery ambitions date back to 2006, culminating in the 2017 acquisition of Whole Foods for $13.7 billion. Despite this, Amazon holds just 1.4% of the U.S. grocery market, compared to Walmart's 23.6% and Kroger's 10%.

Fresh stores, launched in 2020, initially offered cheaper prices than Whole Foods, along with innovative features like cashierless checkout and voice-activated displays. By early 2022, Amazon had 46 Fresh locations worldwide. However, CEO Andy Jassy's cost-cutting measures led to layoffs and the closure of some stores.

In 2023, Amazon resumed investing in Fresh, refining the store experience and testing redesigned formats. The new stores feature a more colorful layout and include Krispy Kreme stalls. Amazon also replaced cashierless technology with computerized Dash Carts, which track items as customers shop.

Despite these efforts, at least 22 Fresh stores remain unopened, and delayed openings have led to lawsuits from landlords. Amazon's scattershot approach to grocery expansion reflects the challenges of breaking into a market dominated by established players.

SATS, a Singapore-based airport services provider, aims to double its overseas food sales by 2029, focusing on India and China. The company, which operates in 33 locations across 10 countries, provides in-flight catering to over 60 airlines and is expanding its ground-based food services.

Stanley Goh, head of SATS' food solutions, emphasizes the need for growth beyond Singapore, noting high demand for ready-to-eat meals in urbanizing China and India. SATS recently opened its largest kitchen in Bengaluru, India, to meet this demand.

To tackle supply chain challenges, SATS partnered with Japanese trading house Mitsui & Co. in July. Mitsui acquired a 15% stake in SATS' subsidiaries in India, Thailand, China, and Singapore for about $27 million. Mitsui's global network aims to resolve supply chain issues and facilitate expansion.

SATS is also diversifying its food business beyond aviation. Its subsidiary, TFK, launched N’s Deli, a frozen-food brand featuring Asian cuisine, available online in Japan. SATS plans to supply frozen meals to Muji by early 2025, leveraging Mitsui's customer network.

Kerry Mok, SATS' CEO, acknowledges the impact of COVID-19 and trade wars on the aviation industry. Despite challenges, SATS remains committed to expanding its food business, aiming for resilience and growth in new markets.
