# World News Daily(2024-07-13) : Germany to Phase Out Huawei and ZTE from 5G Networks

## Germany to Phase Out Huawei and ZTE from 5G Networks

Germany plans to remove Huawei and ZTE from its 5G networks within five years. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser emphasized protecting the economy and communications. Major telecoms like Deutsche Telekom agreed to phase out Chinese components by 2026 in core areas and by 2029 in other parts. This move follows similar bans in several European countries and the U.S. The decision, based on security assessments, aims to prevent sabotage and espionage.

### Trump Seeks to Overturn Conviction in Hush Money Case Following Supreme Court Ruling

Trump's team wants his New York conviction tossed. They cite a recent Supreme Court ruling on ex-presidential immunity. Judge Juan Merchan delayed sentencing to consider this.

Trump's lawyers argue that evidence from his presidency, such as communications with Hope Hicks and his pardon power, should not have been used. They claim these are "core" presidential duties, now protected by the Supreme Court.

The case revolves around hush money paid to Stormy Daniels to silence her about an alleged affair with Trump. He denies the affair and did not testify.

Trump's lawyers also claim the case is politically motivated, targeting District Attorney Alvin Bragg. They argue the prosecution rushed without considering the Supreme Court's guidance on immunity.

This legal battle could impact Trump's other case in Florida, where he is accused of mishandling classified documents. His team is using the same Supreme Court ruling to seek a stay in that case.

### EU AI Act Officially Published, Setting New Standards for AI Regulation

The EU AI Act, a new law, comes into effect on August 1. It's significant for AI developers, but they have two years to comply. Certain provisions will take effect sooner, while others will follow later.

The law categorizes AI into three groups: low risk, high risk, and banned. Most AI falls under low risk. High-risk AI, such as biometrics and law enforcement, will face stringent regulations regarding data and bias. Banned AI includes unsettling practices like social credit scoring and widespread facial recognition.

There's a stipulation for extremely powerful AI, like GPT. They must demonstrate their processes and assess for risks. The EU aims to regulate AI without stifling innovation.

The EU's AI Office will establish codes of practice. The authorship of these codes remains somewhat unclear. The EU is seeking consultants, which has raised concerns among some. They worry the AI industry might craft its own regulations.

In essence, the EU's AI Act is a forced marriage. It's imminent, and all parties must prepare. The specifics are still being finalized, but the deadline approaches.

Raasay, a border collie, sniffs invasive cordgrass underwater. Skylos Ecology trains dogs like her to detect ecological threats. Their keen noses, thousands of times more sensitive than humans', make them ideal for this task.

Tracy Lyten, Skylos founder, selects dogs based on personality and focus. Raasay's patience and curiosity make her a top weed-finder. Cordgrass, hard to spot and quick to spread, colonizes wetlands, threatening biodiversity. It affects fish, crustaceans, mollusks, and shorebirds.

Skylos works with Australian agencies to map and remove cordgrass. When Raasay finds a patch, she alerts Lyten, who logs the GPS coordinates. The data helps target removal efforts. For Raasay, it's just another day ending with a bath.

California's wildfires are raging. Joe Tyler, Cal Fire director, reports over 3,500 fires have burned nearly 220,000 acres—five times the average for mid-July. Tyler warns, "We are not just in a fire season, we are in a fire year."

The state's governor, Gavin Newsom, acknowledges climate change's role. A wet winter followed by heat dried out grasses, fueling fires. Crews battle multiple blazes, including the 34,000-acre Lake fire near Los Angeles and the 11,000-acre Larch Creek fire in Oregon.

Heatwaves intensify the crisis. Las Vegas sets records with five consecutive days above 115F. Heat-related deaths are investigated across multiple states, including California and Oregon.

The situation demands caution. Climate change and extreme weather are pushing wildfire seasons beyond normal limits.

### Southwest Airlines Partners with Archer for Electric Air Taxi Network

Southwest Airlines has partnered with Archer Aviation to develop an electric air taxi network in California. The service will utilize Archer's Midnight aircraft, a four-passenger, battery-powered, tilt-rotor vehicle designed for vertical takeoff and landing. This partnership provides access to 14 airports operated by Southwest. Archer asserts that their air taxis can shorten 60-90 minute car journeys to just 10-20 minutes.

Archer, which came out of stealth mode in 2020, has encountered legal hurdles but has also secured a $1 billion order from United Airlines and a production agreement with Stellantis. They have recently obtained FAA certification for an on-demand air taxi service, with plans to launch in 2025. The collaboration includes involvement from Southwest's unions, such as the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association.

Apple's iPhone payment system, once exclusive, now opens to rivals in Europe. The EU accepted this change to avoid a hefty fine. Apple's move allows third-party wallets access to NFC, a tech for contactless payments.

Margrethe Vestager, EU's competition chief, praised the shift, noting it benefits both competitors and customers. iPhone users can now choose their default wallet, and developers can use iPhone's Face ID for verification.

Apple Pay, once the sole NFC-based mobile wallet, faced antitrust charges for denying access to others. Analysts predict savings from bypassing Apple's fees—0.15% per credit card transaction—could benefit consumers through cashback or loyalty rewards.

Apple must implement these changes across the EU, plus Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein, by July 25. The alterations will be monitored for a decade.

This move promises more choice and potential savings for consumers, while allowing banks and companies to build customer loyalty and offer personalized services directly.

### Sony's Rise as a Gaming Giant: The Nintendo PlayStation Saga

In the late 1980s, Nintendo sought Sony's assistance to develop a CD-ROM add-on for their Super Nintendo console, aiming to expand game storage beyond cartridges. Sony agreed and planned two devices: the SNES-CD and a standalone PlayStation console that could use both Nintendo cartridges and Sony's CDs.

However, Nintendo abruptly ended the partnership, fearing Sony's CD technology would undermine their control over game distribution. This led to the cancellation of the SNES-CD project and Nintendo's pivot to Philips for similar technology.

Sony, initially thwarted, rebranded their console as the PlayStation and launched it in 1994. This move transformed Sony from a peripheral developer to a major player in the gaming industry, setting the stage for a decades-long rivalry with Nintendo.

The "Nintendo PlayStation," a relic of this aborted collaboration, recently resurfaced at auction, highlighting the pivotal moment that reshaped the gaming landscape. This historical divergence marked the beginning of Sony's dominance in the console market, contrasting Nintendo's continued reliance on cartridges.

The saga underscores the critical role of strategic decisions in the tech industry, where a single choice can alter the trajectory of entire markets.

### Frog Saunas Offer Hope in Battle Against Deadly Fungal Disease

Researchers in Australia constructed "frog saunas"—greenhouses made with painted masonry bricks—to aid green and golden bell frogs in combating a lethal fungal disease. These frogs, once prevalent in southeastern Australia, flourished under the warmer conditions, clearing infections and developing resistance.

The fungus, known as Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis or Bd, causes chytridiomycosis, which attacks amphibians' skin and results in heart attacks and death. Identified in 1998, it has led to the extinction of at least 90 species and threatens many more.

Dr. Anthony Waddle, who leads the study at Macquarie University, expressed optimism for the green and golden bell frogs, although he recognized the limitations of the technique. Previous attempts with other species have failed, indicating a possible species-specific response.

The "frog sauna" method provides a rare beacon of hope in the ongoing fight against this devastating disease.

### New Hormone CCN3 Could Revolutionize Bone Health Treatments

  alt="New Hormone CCN3 Could Revolutionize Bone Health Treatments"

Researchers at UC San Francisco and UC Davis have identified a hormone, CCN3, that maintains bone strength during breastfeeding. This hormone has the potential to treat osteoporosis and aid in fracture healing.

Osteoporosis, which weakens bones and leads to frequent fractures, is prevalent among postmenopausal women due to low estrogen levels. However, breastfeeding women, who also have low estrogen, rarely experience osteoporosis. This discrepancy led to the discovery of CCN3.

In mice, CCN3 enhances bone density and strength. Without CCN3, breastfeeding mice experience bone mass loss, and their offspring lose weight. Now referred to as "Motherhood Brain Hormone" (MBH), CCN3 is effective in both sexes, sometimes doubling bone mass.

Tests revealed that bones treated with CCN3 were not only denser but also stronger. A CCN3 gel patch successfully healed fractures in older mice, a milestone not achieved by any other treatment.

The research team plans to investigate CCN3's mechanisms and its potential in treating various bone diseases. They hope it can benefit not only breastfeeding women but also breast cancer survivors, female athletes, and elderly men.
