Israel struck Hezbollah in Lebanon after the group fired rockets and drones into Israel, wounding one. The IDF targeted weapons depots and military sites in over ten locations. Hezbollah's attack followed an Israeli strike that killed one and injured 19 in Lebanon.

US President Biden urged Israeli PM Netanyahu to finalize a Gaza truce and release hostages. Talks in Cairo aim to resolve remaining issues. Israel insists on achieving war objectives, including ensuring Gaza poses no future threat.

In Gaza, Israeli airstrikes killed at least 50 Palestinians. The military hit tunnels and launch sites, seizing weapons. Since October, over 40,000 Palestinians have died in the conflict. The war started when Hamas attacked Israel, killing around 1,200 and abducting 250.

South Korea conducted a nationwide drill on August 22, preparing for potential nuclear or chemical attacks from North Korea. This exercise, the second of its kind in 2023, involved evacuating civilians to designated shelters such as subway stations and underground parking lots.

In Seoul, at a government building housing 2,200 employees, a siren signaled a rapid descent to the basement. Within ten minutes, the space was filled with people. Soldiers were on hand to guide participants on using gas masks and radiation detectors.

The government distributed pamphlets outlining protection methods for various attack scenarios, emphasizing the importance of sheltering underground or in concrete buildings during a nuclear strike.

North Korea, with its 2022 law on nuclear weapon use and ongoing development of tactical nukes, presents a significant threat. Seoul estimates Pyongyang has up to 5,000 tonnes of chemical weapons.

The drills are designed to protect lives and property, encouraging public participation. Over 17,000 evacuation shelters are listed online.

### Trump's Potential Sale of DJT Stock and Its Implications

  alt="Trump's Potential Sale of DJT Stock and Its Implications"
/>

Donald Trump holds 59% of Trump Media, valued at over $2.6 billion. He is restricted from selling until September 25 due to a lock-up agreement, a common practice in IPOs that prevents immediate insider sales following a public listing, aiming for stock stability.

Trump Media merged with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) and went public on Nasdaq as DJT. The lock-up period could end early if DJT remains above $12 for 20 days within a 30-day period.

Selling his shares could pose challenges. A sudden influx of Trump's shares into the market might deter buyers and depress the price. Trump Media has cautioned that this could occur.

If Trump sells, he must report to the SEC within two days, a deadline many insiders often miss.

Cashing out could assist Trump with substantial legal expenses but might negatively impact Trump Media's stock, which is closely linked to his popularity and electoral prospects.

Trump Media's stock has experienced significant volatility. It has declined 71% from its peak, despite its high market capitalization not aligning with its low revenue. Experts view it as a wager on Trump's potential victory in the presidency.

Global nuclear power capacity has reached a record high. China and Russia spearheaded the increase, with 436 reactors and 416 gigawatts of power. China constructed 39 reactors over the past decade, quadrupling its capacity. Russia has now matched Japan's reactor count and has plans for further expansion.

Nuclear power is gaining momentum as a zero-emission energy source. At COP28, 22 countries set a goal to achieve 1,200 GW of nuclear capacity by 2050. However, challenges persist in supply chains and technology.

China and Russia have made significant advancements in nuclear technology post-Fukushima. China launched the world's first commercial small modular reactor (SMR). Russia leads in uranium enrichment and has pioneered a floating nuclear plant.

Western governments are now supporting nuclear development, reversing previous private sector emphasis. France has renationalized EDF to focus on reactor construction. The U.S. provides tax credits and funding to prevent plant closures.

The resurgence of nuclear power underscores its stability and necessity in a carbon-conscious world. Nonetheless, supply chain issues and high costs continue to pose challenges, necessitating government intervention and innovation.

### Gold Prices Surge: Analysts Predict Further Gains and Recommend Miners

Gold prices surged to a record $2,531.60 per ounce. Analysts predict further gains, attributing the rise to geopolitical tensions and inflation. UBS forecasts gold to reach $2,700 by mid-2025, while David Neuhauser anticipates it could hit $3,000 within three years.

Shares of gold mining companies have also climbed, with the VanEck Gold Miners ETF hitting its highest level since April 2022. Wolfe Research indicates that the ETF is not overbought and advises purchasing shares of Royal Gold and Newmont Corporation.

Gold demand remains robust, particularly in China and India. Central banks are continuing to acquire gold, with annual purchases projected to hit 800 tons in 2024.

Investors are also eyeing junior gold miners, which specialize in early-stage exploration. Neuhauser suggests investing in Amaroq Minerals, Hochshild Mining, Coeur Mining, and Wesdome.

Gold acts as a safeguard against inflation and market fluctuations. A depreciating dollar enhances gold's appeal to international buyers, further boosting its price.

Mpox outbreak in Africa, declared a global emergency by WHO, sparks online disinformation.

False claims link mpox to shingles and COVID vaccines. Mpox, identified in the 1970s, is a poxvirus, distinct from shingles, a herpes virus. Symptoms differ.

Mpox transmission isn't limited by sexual orientation. Close, skin-to-skin contact spreads the virus, not sexual preference.

Conspiracy theories claim a miracle cure exists but isn't marketed. Tranilast, suggested for mpox, was only approved for asthma in Japan and China. No human trials for mpox.

WHO hasn't ordered lockdowns for mpox. Countries decide their health measures.

Disinformation complicates public health responses. Clear, factual communication is crucial.

Lung cancer claims 1.8 million lives annually. Survival rates are bleak, particularly when tumors metastasize.

BioNTech's BNT162b2, an mRNA vaccine, seeks to alter this grim reality. It is designed to combat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most prevalent form. Currently in phase 1 trials, the vaccine is being evaluated in seven countries across 34 sites.

The UK initiated the trials with Janusz Racz, 67, receiving the inaugural injection. The vaccine employs mRNA, akin to COVID-19 vaccines, to instruct the immune system to target cancer cells without damaging healthy cells.

Racz, a scientist, volunteered for the trial, optimistic that it will enhance his outlook and contribute to medical progress. The vaccine, in conjunction with immunotherapy, is administered weekly for six weeks, followed by every three weeks for a year.

Professor Siow Ming Lee, who leads the UK trial, believes this mRNA technology could revolutionize cancer treatment. The objective is to thwart cancer recurrence and bolster survival rates.

The UK's National Health Service (NHS) is expediting patient enrollment in these trials, aiming to transform cancer treatment and save lives.

mRNA: Messenger RNA, a molecule that carries instructions from DNA for synthesizing proteins. In this context, it's used to instruct the immune system to recognize and attack specific cancer cells.

### Climate Change Threatens European Wineries

Extreme heat is hitting Europe's wineries hard. In Santorini, Yiannis Paraskevopoulos sees his Assyrtiko grape, a key component of fine white wines, under threat. Last year's harvest at Gaia Wines was a third of 2022's; this year, it's projected to be one-sixth. Paraskevopoulos fears Assyrtiko could disappear by 2040.

Global wine production dropped 10% in 2023, marking the lowest level in over 60 years. Greece's output fell by more than a third, while Italy and Spain saw declines of over one-fifth. The impacts of climate change are evident: heavy rains, droughts, and early frosts.

Costs are rising, and consumers are paying more. One kilogram of Assyrtiko grapes now costs between 8 to 10 euros, double the 2022 prices. Paraskevopoulos is concerned about losing market share.

Some wineries are adapting: Antinori is planting vines differently, raising trellises, and planting grass. Raventós Codorniu is focusing on water efficiency. Skouras is planting at higher altitudes and seeking better water supplies.

Santorini's traditional "koulouras" may not protect vines from worsening weather. The future is uncertain, and adaptation is crucial.

Tangshan, known as the "Hometown of Pufferfish in China," is renowned for its cultivation of the red-spotted pufferfish. With an annual production of thousands of tons, it accounts for 90% of the national total. Pufferfish, once banned from consumption due to their toxins, have seen a significant reduction in toxicity, even becoming non-toxic, through scientific farming methods.

Pufferfish farming in Tangshan began in the 1980s, benefiting from the natural conditions of the Bohai Bay and scientific breakthroughs. Aquaculture farms in Caofeidian utilize closed-factory farming and strict quality control to minimize toxin accumulation. New technologies, such as engineered circulating water systems in seawater ponds, further ensure safety.

The pufferfish industry not only exports but also gradually opens up the domestic market. Tangshan enterprises have introduced pre-prepared pufferfish products, simplifying the cooking process and expanding the consumer base. The pufferfish town combines industry with tourism, attracting visitors for an experiential journey.

From a once-risky delicacy to a safe culinary choice, the story of Tangshan is a perfect blend of technology and tradition.
