# World News Daily(2024-09-15) : Hunan Dongkou County Shantytown Renovation Project Fraud Case: 88 Public Officials Held Accountable

## Hunan Dongkou County Shantytown Renovation Project Fraud Case: 88 Public Officials Held Accountable

Hunan's Dongkou County shantytown renovation project involved fabrication and falsification, with 88 public officials being held accountable. Between 2012 and 2017, the Dongkou County Committee and County Government sought short-term political achievements through illegal decision-making, with public officials from multiple departments colluding with private entrepreneurs to engage in long-term deception, falsely reporting and defrauding national shantytown renovation subsidies.

Former Secretary of the Dongkou County Committee, Ai Fangyi, and 14 other public officials were investigated for suspected duty crimes and placed under retention measures; 74 public officials received party and government disciplinary sanctions. The Shaoyang Municipal Committee and Municipal Government, along with 29 responsible units, were ordered to conduct in-depth inspections and implement rectifications.

Private entrepreneurs Chen Lixin, Xiao Dong, and 9 others were suspected of crimes such as bid rigging and fraud, and have been taken into criminal custody by judicial authorities.

While investigating this case, Hunan Province also launched a province-wide inspection and rectification of similar issues. As of the end of August, the province had uncovered 2,630 problem clues, initiated 1,275 cases, imposed party and government disciplinary sanctions on 889 individuals, transferred 191 to judicial authorities, and recovered or refunded 370 million yuan in illegal and disciplinary funds.

**Shantytown Renovation:** Refers to the renovation of shantytowns in cities with backward infrastructure and poor living conditions, aimed at improving residents' living standards.

Yangzhou, a city famous for the phrase "descending to Yangzhou in the third month of spring," has been opening its government canteens to tourists during holidays since 2019, a pioneering move in China. This initiative not only alleviates dining pressure during peak tourist seasons but also serves as a bright business card for Yangzhou's cultural and tourism industry.

The opening in Yangzhou began with the "Document No. 3," specifically designed to serve tourists. During the 2019 Qingming Festival, the municipal government canteen opened for the first time, accommodating 800 visitors. The canteen offered Huaiyang-style simple meals at cost price, receiving enthusiastic responses from tourists.

The service was temporarily suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic but resumed in 2021 and became normalized in 2023. This year's May Day holiday saw the canteen serving 2,291 tourists, a 77% increase from the previous year.

Yangzhou has continuously improved its services, providing facilities such as self-service water stations and power banks, simplifying parking registration procedures, and increasing the number of parking spaces to 2,481. The canteen introduced 20-yuan and 25-yuan meal sets, ensuring that tourists enjoy "famous shop quality" at "canteen prices."

Yangzhou's openness is not just about physical space but also about shortening psychological distances. Tourists feel welcomed, making Yangzhou feel more approachable.

**Lesson:**
Yangzhou's practice shows that public services can be a powerful driver for cultural and tourism development. By optimizing details, cities can not only attract tourists but also win their hearts. This service-oriented philosophy centered on tourists is worth emulating by other cities.

### Former Facebook Executive Reveals Secret Agreement with Google in Antitrust Trial

  alt="Former Facebook Executive Reveals Secret Agreement with Google in Antitrust Trial"
/>

In the ongoing antitrust trial against Google, a former Facebook ad executive, Brian Boland, testified that Facebook's attempts to compete with Google in online advertising were futile due to Google's dominant position. Boland revealed a secret 2018 agreement between Facebook (now Meta) and Google, dubbed "Jedi Blue." This pact granted Facebook preferential treatment in Google's ad auction system, ensuring it could secure better ad placements.

Boland likened Google's ad platform to a box of apples, where Google picks the best 30 before others can choose. This metaphor underscores Google's ability to monopolize premium ad space, leaving inferior options for competitors.

The agreement, approved by top executives at both companies, was designed to keep Facebook from adopting technologies that could challenge Google's dominance. Despite its significance, the deal's specifics remain undisclosed, with only a mention of Facebook potentially paying 15% of its effective media cost to Google.

Other witnesses, including former News Corp. executive Stephanie Layser, corroborated Google's monopoly in ad tech. Layser noted that News Corp. estimated a $9 million loss if it abandoned Google's ad services, highlighting the industry's reliance on Google.

Google defends its practices, claiming publishers now use multiple platforms. However, Gannett's ad executive Tim Wolfe testified that alternatives to Google's ad server remain impractical.

This trial exposes the intricate web of agreements and monopolistic practices in the digital ad market, raising questions about fair competition and market integrity.

Big Ocean, K-Pop’s first deaf boy band, is making waves. Comprised of Jiseok, Hyunjin, and Chanyeon, all with hearing loss, the trio uses sign language and AI to connect with fans. Their latest single, “Slow,” ranked No. 4 on South American charts.

The group debuted on South Korea’s national day for people with disabilities, April 20. “We want to turn our unexpectedness into a draw,” Jiseok said. They rely on cochlear implants, hearing aids, lip reading, and sign language.

Training involved flashing displays and vibrating watches to sync with music. AI helps correct and mix their voices.

Parastar Entertainment, South Korea’s only talent agency for people with disabilities, manages Big Ocean. CEO Haley Cha, inspired by her Paralympics coverage, founded the agency in 2020.

Cha sees Big Ocean’s live performances as their strength. “They turn music into something you ‘listen’ to with your eyes,” she said.

Big Ocean’s unique approach has boosted their social media following fourfold compared to other K-Pop debuts. Parastar is planning performances in Japan and an all-disabled musical.

“We want to show something fresh and cool that didn’t exist before,” Cha said.

The phrase "Go woke, go broke" doesn't hold up, according to a new study. Brands that align with progressive values, even awkwardly, often see sales boosts. The Unstereotype Alliance, backed by Oxford University researchers, analyzed 392 brands across 58 countries. They found that inclusive ads, free of stereotypes, give brands a 3.5% sales boost in the short term and over 16% in the long term.

Inclusive advertising persuades 62% of buyers to choose a product and makes 15% of shoppers more loyal. The study covered various product categories and geographies. Sara Denby of UN Women says the data should encourage brands to embrace inclusivity for both community benefit and financial growth.

However, some brands have stumbled. Burger King pulled an ad showing people eating burgers with chopsticks. Kendall Jenner and Pepsi faced backlash for a Black Lives Matter-themed ad. Bud Light faced criticism for featuring trans star Dylan Mulvaney. Benetton's 1990s ads, showing graphic scenes like child labor, also missed the mark.

Despite these missteps, the study suggests that inclusive advertising generally pays off. Brands should navigate modern values carefully but confidently.

Katsura's influence extends globally, with her brand sold in the U.S., Canada, China, and Myanmar. She organized the Asia Bridal Summit since the mid-1990s, fostering cultural exchange among Asian bridal industries.

In Japan, Katsura's dresses attract women of all ages. Saki Kakuta, a university student, admired their delicate craftsmanship. Kana Kurahashi, a former salesperson, praised Katsura's unwavering belief in her brand.

Last year, Katsura collaborated with Celford, a younger brand. The Yumi Katsura for Celford label met sales targets, earning up to 60 million yen in each of the 2023 sales seasons.

Katsura's legacy endures through her innovative designs and global impact, ensuring her place in bridal fashion history.

Thousands gathered in Uganda for the military funeral of Olympic athlete Rebecca Cheptegei, who died after her partner set her on fire. Cheptegei, a sergeant in Uganda’s army, was honored with a gun salute. She suffered 80% burns in the attack by Dickson Ndiema, who later died from his injuries. The couple argued over land Cheptegei bought in Kenya.

Cheptegei’s death highlights a troubling pattern of gender-based violence in Kenya, where four female athletes have been killed by their partners in recent years. Uganda’s First Lady, Janet Museveni, called the attack “deeply disturbing.” The National Council of Sports of Uganda condemned the act as “cowardly and senseless.”

In Kenya, 41% of women experience physical or sexual violence from their partners. Many Ugandan athletes train in Kenya, drawn by better facilities. Cheptegei, who competed in the Paris Olympics, was buried at her father’s homestead in Bukwo.

UEFA has threatened to ban England from the 2028 European Championship, which the country is co-hosting, due to concerns over a proposed independent football regulator. The regulator, planned by the UK government, aims to ensure financial sustainability in English football's top five tiers. UEFA fears this could lead to government interference, violating their rules against such meddling.

The regulator's role includes overseeing club licensing and strengthening the owners and directors test. However, UEFA's general secretary, Theodore Theodoridis, warns of potential "scope creep," where the regulator might expand its mandate beyond financial oversight, encroaching on football governance.

Theodoridis emphasizes the need to protect the Football Association's (FA) independence, stating that any legislation compromising the FA's autonomy would breach UEFA and FIFA statutes. He also raises concerns about clauses in the legislation that require the regulator to consider government foreign and trade policy objectives.

Despite these warnings, the UK government remains confident that the Football Governance Bill will benefit English football, ensuring its sustainability and putting fans at the heart of the game.

### Durian's Rise Impacts Global Coffee Prices Amid Climate Challenges

A freak frost in Brazil in 2021 decimated Arabica coffee crops, driving prices up. Buyers turned to Vietnam for Robusta beans, but droughts there reduced yields. Vietnamese farmers, chasing higher profits, replaced coffee with durian, the world’s smelliest fruit. This shift, combined with depleted coffee stocks, pushed Robusta prices to near-record highs.

The International Coffee Organisation reports a 50% drop in Robusta exports from Vietnam. Other producers like Colombia and Ethiopia have ramped up supply, but not enough to meet demand. Judy Ganes, an analyst, calls it a "perfect storm."

Wholesaler Paul Armstrong sees prices rising, potentially surpassing £5 in the UK. He notes that while beans contribute less than 10% to retail coffee prices, inflationary costs are driving up overall prices. Felipe Barretto Croce, CEO of FAFCoffees in Brazil, agrees, highlighting that high-quality coffee may now seem more affordable compared to lower-quality blends.

The upcoming spring crop in Brazil is crucial. Early rains could stabilize the market, but late rains could worsen shortages. Long-term, climate change threatens coffee production, with studies predicting a 50% decline in suitable growing areas by 2050.

A "green premium"—a small tax on coffee to fund sustainable farming—could help mitigate these challenges. But for now, the smell of durian is adding to the bitter taste of rising coffee prices.

Malaysia plans to increase its sugar tax, aiming to curb diabetes and non-communicable diseases. The current tax, introduced in 2019, charges 0.5 ringgit per liter for sugary drinks. Health Minister Dzulkefly Ahmad announced a further increase, which will be detailed in the 2025 budget.

The existing tax has reduced sugar consumption by 9.25%. However, diabetes remains a significant issue, affecting 15.6% of adults. Obesity rates have risen from 44.5% to 54.4% since 2011.

Experts suggest expanding the tax to include refined sugars and high-fructose corn syrup. This could prevent consumers from shifting to alternative sugary sources.

The goal is to make sugar less appealing by increasing costs. While this won’t eliminate non-communicable diseases, it’s a step in the right direction. Education and awareness are next.

**Key Terms:**
- **Non-communicable diseases (NCDs):** Chronic illnesses like diabetes, hypertension, and obesity that are not contagious.
- **High-fructose corn syrup:** A sweetener commonly used in processed foods, contributing to high sugar intake.

### Cruciferous Vegetables More Effective at Lowering Blood Pressure Than Root Vegetables, Study Finds

  alt="Cruciferous Vegetables More Effective at Lowering Blood Pressure Than Root Vegetables, Study Finds"
/>

A new study from Edith Cowan University reveals that cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and kale are more effective at lowering blood pressure than root vegetables. This could benefit heart health and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

In a randomized controlled crossover study, participants with hypertension who consumed four servings of cruciferous vegetables daily saw a significant drop in blood pressure compared to those who ate equal amounts of root and gourd vegetables.

Cruciferous vegetables contain glucosinolates, compounds shown to lower blood pressure in animals. They also have nitrates and vitamin K, which may offer additional benefits.

High blood pressure is a leading risk factor for heart disease, especially in older adults. Previous studies suggested that cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cabbage are more closely linked to reduced heart disease risk than other veggies.

However, cruciferous vegetables typically make up only a small portion of overall vegetable intake. Only about one in 15 Australian adults meets recommended vegetable intake levels, a figure that has been declining.

The six-week study involved two two-week dietary interventions with a two-week "washout" period in between. Participants ate either cruciferous or root vegetable soups for lunch and dinner. Blood pressure was measured before and after each intervention.

Eating cruciferous vegetables lowered blood pressure by 2.5 mmHg more than root vegetables. This reduction could lower the risk of heart attack or stroke by about 5%.

The Heart Foundation welcomed the findings, encouraging people to incorporate more cruciferous vegetables into their diets. They emphasized the importance of a heart-healthy diet rich in various vegetables.
