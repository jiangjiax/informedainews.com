### "China's Rapid Expansion in Renewable Energy"

China's push for clean energy is massive. They are adding renewable sources at a rate equivalent to constructing five large nuclear plants every week. The Sydney-based think tank, CEF, predicts they will reach their 2030 target six years ahead of schedule.

China is installing 10 gigawatts of wind and solar power every two weeks, which is a significant amount. With China accounting for a third of the world's total emissions, these emissions might have already peaked. Their power grid is rapidly going green.

Large solar and wind farms in the west are connected to the east via massive transmission lines. They are also constructing coal plants to maintain stability, although coal's role is diminishing. Renewables could surpass coal in power generation this year.

China's focus is more on solar and wind than nuclear energy. Last year, they added 1 gigawatt of nuclear power but 300 gigawatts of solar and wind. Their nuclear plans are lagging, but their renewables are advancing.

Despite the construction of new coal plants, renewables are expected to meet all new electricity demand. Coal's future is a gradual decline. China's CO2 intensity is improving, though not as quickly as the EU, it is faster than the U.S.

Pengzhan Sun, an Assistant Professor at the University of Macau, focuses on the development of two-dimensional material membranes and fundamental issues in separation science. He has utilized graphene to seal graphite single crystal microcavities, enhancing the precision of gas transmembrane transmission measurements by eight to nine orders of magnitude. His findings revealed that hydrogen molecules can anomalously penetrate the graphene lattice, while helium atoms cannot. This discovery challenges the conventional understanding of graphene's chemical inertness and suggests its catalytic activity.

Sun further precisely fabricated single atomic vacancy channels on the surface of graphene, discovering that these channels exhibit exponential-level sieving capabilities for different gas molecules. These research outcomes provide scientific basis for the development of high-precision molecular detection, non-precious metal catalysts, and atom-scale porous two-dimensional separation membranes.

Sun's research not only deepens the understanding of material transport processes in atomic-scale confined spaces but also aims to transform fundamental scientific findings into practical technologies, serving environmental, energy, and chemical sectors. His work demonstrates the significant potential of two-dimensional materials in addressing common separation issues such as high energy consumption and low efficiency.

### Airbnb's Hidden Camera Controversy: Privacy and Security Concerns

CNN investigated Airbnb's hidden camera issue. Over a decade, 35,000 complaints about spying devices surfaced. Airbnb downplays the scale, but police have seized countless invasive images.

Airbnb's response is slow and secretive. They don't alert authorities when cameras are found, even involving kids. Legal action against Airbnb is tough; their terms push disputes into private arbitration, away from public scrutiny. Confidentiality agreements further shield them.

Airbnb claims these incidents are rare and act swiftly when alerted. Yet, their approach seems more about managing public image than protecting guests. The tech advances, making tiny, invisible cameras easier to hide, complicating detection and trust.

Britain's arts are hurting. Funding dropped 6% since 2010. Germany, France, and Finland boosted theirs by up to 70%.

The State of the Arts report, released on Monday, details the cuts. Local government funding for culture fell 39% in Scotland, 40% in Wales, 48% in England. The DCMS's core funding shrank 18%. Arts councils in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland saw similar drops.

Arts education also took a hit. GCSE and A-level entries in arts subjects plummeted 47% and 29% since 2010. The report calls this a "catastrophic decline."

Heidi Ashton, from the University of Warwick, says the report shows a "lack of support in all areas." She calls for a "fundamental shift" in thinking about the arts' role in society.

Earnings in the arts sector lag. Arts professionals make less than the UK median. Pay gaps exist, especially in craft skills, where men earn 70% more than women.

Jack Gamble, of the Campaign for the Arts, says the UK now ranks low in public funding for arts and culture among European nations. He urges the new government to address this.

  alt="AI Facial Temperature Analysis Predicts Health Risks"

Researchers at Peking University have linked facial temperatures to chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. They utilize AI with thermal imaging to identify these patterns. This technology could aid in predicting health issues and promoting healthy aging.

The study, published in "Cell Metabolism," discovered that specific areas of the face, like the nose and cheeks, exhibit particular temperature changes prior to the onset of health problems. These subtle shifts are imperceptible to touch but can be detected by AI trained on thermal data.

Lead researcher Jing-Dong Jackie Han noted that facial temperature can predict "thermal age," a measure of how rapidly one ages. Higher temperatures in the nose and lower temperatures around the eyes suggest a younger thermal age. In contrast, warmer cheeks and eyes could indicate inflammation and accelerated aging.

Interestingly, a two-week jump rope regimen reduced participants' thermal age by five years, suggesting a connection between exercise and aging markers.

The team plans to extend this method to diagnose other conditions, such as sleep disorders and heart issues. Han believes facial thermal imaging could serve as a non-invasive tool for early disease detection and health management.

Tadej Pogacar, 25, secured his third Tour de France title, achieving a historic Giro d’Italia-Tour de France double. No rider had accomplished this feat in the modern era. Pogacar dominated the final time trial in Nice, finishing 6:17 ahead of Jonas Vingegaard.

Throughout the race, Pogacar won six stages in both the Giro and the Tour, a first in the event's history. His performance invites comparisons to Eddy Merckx, widely regarded as cycling’s greatest champion. Merckx won five Tours; Pogacar now has three from five starts.

The landscape of the Tour has evolved. It has become globalized, technology-driven, and commercialized. Pogacar, hailing from Slovenia, epitomizes this new era. His success stands in stark contrast to Marco Pantani’s 1998 double, achieved during a doping-riddled period.

Mark Cavendish, 39, likely participated in his final Tour. He is expected to transition to a role with his sponsors.

Pogacar’s victory was not without controversy. Questions were raised about his team’s use of carbon monoxide rebreathing. Despite this, his dominance is unquestionable.

The race also showcased new talents. Eritrean Biniam Girmay won three stages and the green jersey. Richard Carapaz, from Ecuador, claimed the King of the Mountains title.

Critics argue that the ‘Netflixisation’ of the Tour undermines tradition. However, the sport continues to attract a new, tech-savvy audience, drawn to Pogacar’s relentless performance.
