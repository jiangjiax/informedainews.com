## California Bans Legacy Admissions in Universities

California has banned universities from admitting students based on family connections, affecting both public and private non-profit institutions like Stanford and USC. This law, effective September 2025, aims to level the playing field by prioritizing hard work and merit over legacy or donor ties.

Legacy admissions, often dubbed "affirmative action for rich kids," have long favored wealthier, less racially diverse student bodies. The move follows the Supreme Court's ban on race-based affirmative action, which highlighted the inequities of non-racial preferences.

Advocacy groups view this as a crucial step toward dismantling unfair practices. Stanford reported that 15.4% of its 2023 incoming class benefited from legacy or donor connections, though all met academic standards. USC admitted 14.5% based on such relationships.

Governor Gavin Newsom emphasized fairness, stating that higher education should be accessible through merit and hard work. The public University of California system eliminated legacy admissions in 1998.

The impact of this law remains uncertain, as wealthy families still possess numerous advantages in the competitive admissions process. The end of affirmative action for racial minorities is expected to further challenge underrepresented students' access to elite institutions.

### Trump's Legal Battle to Conceal Election Interference Details Ahead of 2024 Election

  alt="Trump's Legal Battle to Conceal Election Interference Details Ahead of 2024 Election"

Trump’s lawyers fought to keep details of his 2020 election interference hidden, days before the 2024 election. Special counsel prosecutors sought to reveal parts of a 180-page secret brief, including grand jury testimonies from Trump’s inner circle.

Prosecutors proposed redacting specific names but keeping job titles like “Campaign Manager” and “Chief of Staff” to protect lesser-known witnesses. Trump’s team argued this made identification too easy, accusing prosecutors of aiming to harm his campaign.

The dispute mirrored a previous case in Florida, where prosecutors sought complete anonymity for witnesses. Trump had then pushed for looser redactions, but now sought stricter ones to shield his actions.

The Supreme Court’s recent ruling on presidential immunity complicates matters, tasking Judge Tanya Chutkan with sorting through the indictment. This process could take months, involving hearings to determine which allegations stand.

Much of the evidence, including grand jury testimonies, remains secret. Judge Chutkan will decide how much can be made public.

### Middle East Tensions Escalate: Oil Supply Disruptions Feared Amid Iran-Israel Conflict

Iran's missile strike on Israel, in retaliation for recent killings, has escalated Middle East tensions. Analysts warn of imminent oil supply disruptions, with up to 4% of global supply at risk. An attack on Iran's oil infrastructure could drive prices above $100 per barrel.

Israel's ground forces in Lebanon and its offensive against Hezbollah, an Iran-backed group, have intensified the conflict. While most missiles were intercepted, the threat remains. Oil prices surged 5% before settling at a 2% increase. Brent crude now trades at $74.62, and WTI at $70.95 per barrel.

The conflict, shifting from Gaza to Lebanon and Iran, enters a more energy-related phase. Increased U.S. production and sluggish Chinese demand have kept prices low, but this could change.

Iran, OPEC's third-largest producer, pumps nearly four million barrels daily. Analysts predict Israel's retaliation will be severe, potentially disrupting Iranian exports and sending prices soaring.

**Key Terms:**
- **OPEC:** Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, a group of oil-producing nations.
- **Brent crude:** A major global oil benchmark.
- **WTI:** West Texas Intermediate, another major oil benchmark.
- **Hezbollah:** A Lebanon-based, Iran-backed militant group.

### Ireland Plans to Invest Apple Tax Windfall in Infrastructure

Ireland plans to spend €13 billion ($14.4 billion) in Apple back taxes on infrastructure. The money comes from a European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruling against Apple's tax affairs in Ireland. Finance Minister Jack Chambers calls it a "transformational" windfall.

Chambers emphasizes the need to invest in housing, energy, water, and transport. He warns against using the funds for daily expenses or narrowing the tax base. The ECJ's decision, final and welcomed by tax justice advocates, forces Apple to pay billions in back taxes.

Ireland's corporate tax rate is one of the lowest in the EU. The country initially fought the ruling, fearing it could deter investment. The ECJ confirmed the European Commission's 2016 decision that Ireland granted Apple unlawful aid.

Ireland's budget surplus, partly due to strong corporate tax receipts, positions it well for these investments. Dublin Chamber CEO Mary Rose Burke supports the focus on "infrastructure essentials," stressing the importance of ringfenced funding for water, wastewater, and electricity grid projects.

### AI-Generated Forgery Sparks Controversy: The Xiao Yang Ge Incident Highlights Deepfake Misuse Risks

  alt="AI-Generated Forgery Sparks Controversy: The Xiao Yang Ge Incident Highlights Deepfake Misuse Risks"
/>

AI-generated forgery technology has once again sparked controversy, stemming from the "Lu Wenqing recording" in the "Xiao Yangge incident" being confirmed as AI-synthesized. This technology, known as Deepfake, uses deep learning to simulate audio and video, capable of synthesizing realistic human voices and facial expressions. The technology itself is neutral, but the risk of abuse is high.

Lin Hongxiang, CEO of Fengping Intelligence, pointed out that AI technology enhances production efficiency, but requires systematic regulation to prevent misuse. Currently, with just a few minutes of material, AI can clone a complete human voice at a low cost. Professional models can more realistically simulate emotions and intonations.

Technically, AI-synthesized audio and video can be identified by adding feature markers, but the popularity is limited due to cost issues. Unscrupulous individuals often use AI for scams, such as the HK$200 million scam in Hong Kong, where AI face-swapping and voice-changing were used for video conference fraud.

AI synthesis technology has matured and is widely used in the film and television industry, such as Andy Lau's digital life in "The Wandering Earth 2." The technology is not inherently wrong; the key lies with the user. Controlling human nature is the way to save AI.

Dockworkers at 14 U.S. East and Gulf Coast ports went on strike October 1, 2024, demanding wage increases and opposing automation. The strike threatens $3 trillion in annual trade, potentially devastating the economy.

Matthew Shay, National Retail Federation CEO, warns of higher consumer prices due to limited supplies and increased demand for imported goods. The strike comes amid a fragile economic recovery and post-Hurricane Helene hardship.

Inflation has slowed but not reversed; August's consumer price index rose 2.5% year-over-year. Lauren Saidel-Baker, ITR Economics economist, predicts the strike could reignite goods-side inflation.

The strike echoes the 2020 pandemic supply chain crisis, where goods shortages drove up prices. Lisa DeNight, Newmark managing director, emphasizes that the strike's duration amplifies its impact.

Amir Mousavian, University of New England supply chain professor, notes that perishable goods like coffee and bananas will see immediate price hikes. Longer strikes could raise costs for pharmaceuticals, apparel, and automobiles, ultimately burdening consumers.

The timing—ahead of the holiday season and U.S. elections—adds urgency. The Federal Reserve's recent rate cut aimed to ease living costs, but a prolonged strike could force a policy rethink.

Singapore, a magnet for wealthy Chinese, is tightening its screening of family offices. These offices, which manage assets for high net worth families, now face stricter vetting by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and external auditors. The crackdown follows a money laundering scandal involving Chinese nationals, dubbed the "Fujian gang," whose assets worth over $2.34 billion were seized.

Previously, MAS handled most screening duties. But with the surge in family offices—which enjoy tax breaks in exchange for investing in Singapore—and rising concerns over financial crime, MAS has enlisted outside help. This includes EY’s Forensic and Integrity Services unit, which scrutinizes applicants for ties to money laundering, terrorism financing, or other offenses.

The enhanced screening aims to protect Singapore’s reputation as a regional wealth hub. Mandeep Nalwa, CEO of Taurus Wealth, notes that while Singapore attracts clean money, some seek to launder ill-gotten gains, hoping to gain credibility once based in the city-state.

Singapore’s tightening measures reflect broader concerns about financial crime tarnishing its image. Tim Peters of Enghouse Systems warns that any significant scandal could deter future investments. McKinsey’s analysis highlights the scale of wealth movement to Singapore, totaling $400 billion from China alone by the end of 2023.

The city-state’s popularity as a family office hub is evident, with the number rising from 400 in 2020 to 1,650 by August 2024. Singapore’s Second Finance Minister expects this year’s new family offices to exceed 300. The challenge lies in balancing growth with stringent oversight to maintain its financial integrity.

### Man Accused of Hacking Office365 Accounts for Stock Trading Profits

A UK man, Robert B. Westbrook, allegedly made $3.75 million by hacking into executives' Office365 accounts. He accessed quarterly financial reports before they went public, allowing him to trade stocks profitably. When he expected stock prices to drop, he bought "put" options, which let him sell shares at a set price later. For rising stocks, he bought low and sold high.

Westbrook faces charges of securities fraud, wire fraud, and computer fraud. Securities fraud carries up to 20 years in prison and $5 million in fines. Wire fraud penalties are up to 20 years and a fine of $250,000 or twice the gain or loss. Computer fraud charges each carry up to five years and a similar fine.

The SEC, despite Westbrook's use of anonymous emails, VPNs, and bitcoin, tracked him using advanced data analytics and crypto tracing. This case highlights the SEC's efforts to combat cyber fraud and protect markets.

### Young Chinese 'Retiring' to Rural Areas Amid Urban Job Scarcity

Young Chinese, frustrated by the scarcity of urban jobs, are returning to the countryside. Gen Z and millennials are documenting their rural "retirement" on social media, often after being laid off or quitting their jobs. Wenzi Dada, a 22-year-old, moved to a bamboo shack in Guizhou, seeking meaning in life beyond the monotony of the city.

China's youth unemployment rate reached 18.8% in August, the highest on record. Chung Chi Nien, chair professor at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, attributes this to economic difficulties and intense job competition. College degrees have "devalued," making it harder for less experienced youth to find work.

Popular retreat destinations include Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan, where living costs are lower. Despite the availability of jobs in delivery, ride-hailing, and manufacturing, young people prefer to wait for better opportunities. Wenzi defends his choice, questioning societal norms that dictate work as a necessity.

Some are turning to e-commerce or social media, leveraging rural settings for content creation. "Youth nursing homes" cater to this trend, offering spaces for reflection and reset. Experts view this as a temporary phenomenon, with long-term goals still centered in cities.

**Key Terms:**
- **Gen Z/Millennials:** Generations born roughly between 1997-2012 (Gen Z) and 1981-1996 (Millennials).
- **E-commerce:** Online buying and selling of goods.
- **Social media influencers:** Individuals who gain popularity by creating content on platforms like Douyin (TikTok).
- **Youth nursing homes:** Facilities marketed for young people to relax and reset, often excluding older guests.

Francis Ford Coppola’s latest film, *Megalopolis*, starring Adam Driver and Aubrey Plaza, has sparked intense debate since its release. The film, a blend of visual spectacle and unconventional storytelling, was initially controversial due to Coppola’s casting of “cancelled” actors like Jon Voight and Shia LaBeouf. Critics and audiences are polarized, with some praising its ambition and others dismissing it as a failure.

The film’s box office performance has been dismal, earning just $4 million in its opening weekend despite a $140 million budget. Reports suggest it’s playing to near-empty theaters, lagging behind even poorly reviewed foreign films.

Yet, *Megalopolis* has ignited a fervent online discourse. Memorable scenes, such as Adam Driver’s peculiar dialogue delivery, have become viral sensations. The film’s themes—about the future of the U.S., creativity, and Hollywood’s risk aversion—are provoking deep reflection.

Reviews are mixed, with Rotten Tomatoes showing a 49% critic score and a 34% audience score. Some see it as a bold masterpiece, while others view it as a misguided flop. Regardless of opinion, *Megalopolis* is undeniably a topic of intense conversation.

In essence, *Megalopolis* is a cinematic experiment that has divided viewers and critics alike, making it a must-see—or must-avoid—depending on one’s perspective.

### Emilia Pérez: A Transgender Cartel Musical

"Emilia Pérez" is a film about a transgender cartel boss who undergoes gender-affirming surgery. Directed by Jacques Audiard, it won the Jury Prize at Cannes. The story follows Emilia, formerly Manitas, who seeks to escape her violent past by faking her death and starting anew.

Zoe Saldaña plays Rita, a defense attorney who helps Emilia. The film blends musical numbers with a gritty cartel narrative, exploring themes of identity and redemption. Emilia's journey involves complex moral dilemmas and social commentary on gender dysphoria and societal expectations.

Audiard's film raises questions about the mind, body, and soul, particularly how physical transformation impacts one's sense of self. The use of male pronouns for Emilia before her surgery highlights the divide between her past and present identities.

While some critics note potential gaps in understanding trans issues by the predominantly cisgender creative team, the film's exploration of Emilia's internal conflict and societal pressures offers a nuanced portrayal. The energetic musical sequences contrast with the film's darker themes, creating a dynamic and thought-provoking experience.

India's corporate sector faces harsh criticism for its relentless work culture. Employees, especially in formal jobs, endure long hours and high pressure. The average Indian works 47 hours a week, more than in China, Singapore, and Japan.

Anna Sebastian Perayil, a 26-year-old chartered accountant, died after four months at Ernst and Young. Her mother blamed the "overwhelming" work environment. A former employee described a toxic culture, with 12-13 hour days and belittling treatment.

Competition for corporate jobs is fierce. Thousands apply for single positions, making companies resistant to change. Ernst and Young denies the allegations but acknowledges the need for employee well-being.

Other sectors, like IT and media, face similar issues. Narayana Murthy, founder of Infosys, suggested 70-hour workweeks for national growth. Employees report strict monitoring and exploitation.

The relentless demands take a toll on mental health. Some leave for freelance work, seeking relief from toxic office politics. The system remains exploitative, with little incentive for change.

A 4-month-old girl in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, starved to death while her single mother was away for eight days. The mother, Chen, has been arrested on suspicion of murder.

Funeral worker Ah Xiu described the infant as emaciated, with an empty stomach and no waste in her body. Her tiny frame barely filled the mortuary tray. Despite their experience with death, Ah Xiu and his team wept throughout the process.

When the baby was cremated, her small, underdeveloped body left no ashes, just a puff of smoke. Ah Xiu and his team set up a makeshift altar with baby snacks and milk, hoping to ease her suffering in death.

Chen, unemployed and financially struggling, had already given up her older daughter to her mother. Her repeated pregnancies and inability to care for her children led to this tragic outcome.

Social services had visited Chen multiple times but found no immediate issues. The case highlights the challenges of identifying and supporting at-risk families.

This heartbreaking story underscores the fragility of life and the importance of effective social support systems.

### Infancy Antibiotic Use and Increased Aggressive Behavior: A Study on the Association

  alt="Infancy Antibiotic Use and Increased Aggressive Behavior: A Study on the Association"

Scientists have found a link between antibiotic use in infancy and increased aggressive behavior. Research shows that early disruption of the gut microbiome, particularly through antibiotic use, leads to heightened aggression in mice.

A study led by Professor Omry Koren and Dr. Atara Uzzan-Yuzari of Bar-Ilan University revealed this phenomenon. They transplanted the microbiomes of infants treated with antibiotics into mice and found a significant increase in aggression in these mice.

Using the "resident-intruder" paradigm, the study observed that antibiotics reduce gut bacterial diversity, directly linking this to increased aggression. Metabolites and gene expression related to aggression in the mice's brains also changed.

The study employed "humanized" mice, which are mice implanted with human gut bacteria, enhancing the relevance of the results to human behavior. It also explored the biochemical mechanisms behind the behavioral changes, measuring levels of neurotransmitters in the mice's brains.

The results indicate that the gut-brain axis plays a crucial role in the development of aggressive behavior, especially during critical developmental periods like infancy. This provides new insights into how early interventions can influence long-term behavioral outcomes.

**Key Term Explanations:**
- **Gut Microbiome**: The community of microorganisms living in the gut, which significantly impacts health.
- **Humanized Mice**: Mice implanted with human gut bacteria, used to study human health and behavior.
- **Gut-Brain Axis**: The interaction between the gut and the brain, influencing behavior and mood.

### Aivei: Challenges and Opportunities in China's Assisted Reproductive Industry

Aivi Healthcare, a private assisted reproductive technology (ART) hospital in China, has recently made another attempt to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, reflecting the severe challenges in China's fertility landscape. In 2022, China experienced its first population decline in 60 years, with the number of newborns dropping from 15.2 million in 2018 to 9 million in 2023, and the birth rate falling from 1.1% to 0.6%. Social pressures have led to a decline in young people's willingness to have children, prompting the government to introduce a three-child policy and accelerate the inclusion of ART in medical insurance to encourage childbirth.

Ren Jizhong, the founder of Aivi Healthcare, is a 1960s-born accountant who transitioned into the ART field. In 2006, he left his position as general manager of an audio company to enter the ART industry. Under the guidance of Professor Zhang Lizhu, he opened the first hospital, Zhanjiang Jiuhe Hospital, in 2009. Despite facing challenges such as funding shortages and a lack of talent, the company has grown to become the fourth-largest ART service provider in China, having helped deliver 36,000 IVF babies.

The company's finances are robust, with revenues from 2021 to the first half of 2024 being 4.2 billion yuan, 4.07 billion yuan, 4.94 billion yuan, and 2.51 billion yuan respectively, with a gross profit margin consistently above 40%. Zhanjiang Jiuhe Hospital contributes nearly half of the revenue, but Jieyang Aivi Healthcare Hospital has the highest success rate, over 65%, mainly due to the traditional early marriage and childbearing culture in eastern Guangdong.

Aivi Healthcare faces the challenge of increasing numbers of infertile couples, rising from 55.4 million pairs in 2018 to 58 million pairs in 2023, with an expected increase to 67.4 million pairs by 2030. The company has not yet obtained a PGT (Preimplantation Genetic Testing) license and plans to use the funds raised from the IPO to enhance its technological capabilities.

Aivi Healthcare's story is one of perseverance and cross-industry innovation, and it is a true reflection of China's current fertility situation. At the intersection of policy encouragement and market demand, it stands at the forefront of the风口浪尖.
