Prosecutors raided the residence of former Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je this morning as part of their investigation into the Core Pacific City corruption scandal. Ko initially refused to open the door, temporarily obstructing the search. Prosecutors did not issue a subpoena but directly went to Ko's residence to conduct a simultaneous search and interview.
The Core Pacific City case involves NT$450 million in bribes, with city councilor Angela Ying being bribed to pressure Ko's city government to increase the floor area ratio. Shen Ching-ching, Angela Ying, and Ying's assistant Wu Shun-min have already been detained.
Today's interrogation of Ko Wen-je will focus on confirming his illegal approval of the floor area ratio increase, which involves the crime of profiteering. Prosecutors will subsequently investigate the cash flow to explore potential corruption or unexplained wealth charges.

- Core Pacific City: A shopping mall in Taipei that was once a local landmark. It ceased operations in 2019 due to poor business, and the Wei Jing Group later obtained the redevelopment rights, planning urban renewal and construction of commercial and office buildings.
- Floor area ratio: The ratio of a building's total floor area to the size of the parcel of land upon which it is built, commonly used to measure land use density. In the Core Pacific City case, the ratio was increased from 392% to 840%, prompting public suspicion of improper benefits.
- Agency Against Corruption: Taiwan's prosecutorial agency responsible for anti-corruption and integrity-related investigations.
- Profiteering: Using one's official position to violate laws and regulations to obtain personal or others' benefits.
- Cash flow investigation: Investigating the movement of funds to determine if corruption or other illegal activities exist.

/>

South Korea's Constitutional Court has ordered the government to outline carbon emission reductions through 2049. This decision backs climate activists who claim that inadequate emission cuts infringe on their rights.

The court required revising the climate law, with a focus on strategies from 2031 to 2049. It dismissed demands for a more aggressive 2030 goal, noting that the plaintiffs did not demonstrate the policy as unconstitutional.

Justice Lee Eun-ae pointed out the absence of plans beyond 2031 as unconstitutional, placing a burden on future generations. The Ministry of Environment has committed to adhering to the court's ruling.

Activists anticipate that this verdict will encourage comparable measures worldwide. They call for more robust 2030 targets and comprehensive plans for the following years.

South Korea's government, led by President Yoon Suk Yeol, has prioritized nuclear energy. Critics advocate for less dependence on coal and greater use of renewable energy. Currently, just 9% of South Korea's electricity is derived from renewables, significantly below the OECD average of 34%.

Environmental groups have criticized the court for not advocating for a more ambitious climate goal. Nonetheless, some view the ruling as a pivotal move in Asia, potentially impacting other nations such as Japan.

### "Legal Risks for Tech Executives Regarding Platform Content"

Tech executives are facing increasing legal risks related to content on their platforms. X closed its operations in Brazil following threats to its executives. Binance's Zhao pleaded guilty to money laundering charges. Twitter executives in India were threatened with arrest over takedowns requested by the government. Telegram's Durov was indicted in France for crimes on the platform, including child abuse imagery.

Traditionally, liability fell on companies, not individuals. U.S. law protected platforms from harm caused by users, thanks to Section 230. However, the standards are changing, particularly in areas of child safety. Britain's new legislation holds executives personally responsible for failing to remove content that endangers children.

Durov's indictment signifies a shift. His defiance of authority and Telegram's refusal to comply with French law enforcement have drawn intense scrutiny. Telegram claims that EU laws exempt platforms from responsibility for user abuse.

Meta has fought to exclude Zuckerberg from a child protection lawsuit. In authoritarian countries, U.S. tech firms strive to protect their employees to prevent being used as leverage by governments.

Previous cases have seen executives charged but ultimately acquitted. Executives like Somm of CompuServe, Koogle of Yahoo, and Dotcom of Megaupload faced legal challenges but avoided conviction.

It is difficult to prove that executives were aware of crimes on their platforms. Platforms such as TikTok and Meta actively report illegal content. Awareness remains crucial in determining whether immunity is lost.

Personal sanctions carry more weight than corporate fines, compelling executives to act responsibly.

PFAS, or "forever chemicals," are difficult to break down and pose a risk to both human health and the environment. Traditional methods for removing them from water either trap them or break them down, but not both.

Engineers at UBC have developed a new solution. They utilize a combination of iron oxide and graphite as a catalyst. This material captures PFAS and converts them into harmless components. The process is fast, cost-effective, and functions in low light conditions, not just under strong UV.

This catalyst is versatile and can also address other persistent pollutants. The team believes it could revolutionize water purification. They are evaluating its market potential through their company, ReAct Materials.

The catalyst is both simple and sustainable, made from waste materials such as wood or agricultural byproducts. It effectively removes PFAS from water within just three hours, significantly faster than current methods. This innovation could be a major advancement in maintaining clean water supplies.

The Western Land-Sea Corridor, a vital logistics artery connecting China's western regions to the world, is transforming the fortunes of inland areas. Beginning in Chongqing, it traverses Guangxi and Yunnan, reaching global markets. Over the past five years, it has not only expedited cargo transport but also spurred robust economic growth along its route.

The opening of the corridor has addressed long-standing logistics challenges in the west. For instance, Yang Ming of Zun Cheng Supply Chain used to be troubled by lengthy transport times. Now, fresh produce from Southeast Asia can quickly reach western China, reducing the risk of spoilage.

Lemons from Tongnan, Chongqing, which once struggled to enter international markets, are now exported to over 30 countries via the new corridor. Similar stories are unfolding in Ningxia, Xinjiang, Guangxi, and Guizhou, where local specialty products are reaching the world through the new corridor.

The corridor has not only accelerated logistics but also driven industrial upgrades. For example, Chongqing Hua Feng Chemical's adipic acid, exported via the corridor, has seen a 20-day reduction in logistics time and cost savings, enhancing the company's market competitiveness and attracting more international clients.

Countries along the route have also benefited. Products like Thai longans, Laotian rice, and Vietnamese basa fish enter the Chinese market quickly through the corridor, reducing costs and improving competitiveness.

The Western Land-Sea Corridor is not just a logistics route; it is an international economic corridor that unleashes new momentum in China's west, offering new opportunities for沿线国家和地区带来了新机遇.

  alt="'China's Export Restrictions on Rare Metals Impact Global Markets'"
/>

China's recent export restrictions on rare metals such as antimony and gallium have caused prices to skyrocket. Antimony, used in flame retardants and solar cells, saw its price surge to $25,000 per tonne, more than doubling its value at the end of last year. Gallium, essential for semiconductors, experienced a 20% price increase within a month.

China holds a dominant position in the global production of these metals, accounting for 48% of antimony and over 90% of gallium. The introduction of new export licenses has raised concerns about potential supply shortages, prompting buyers to stockpile. Despite a slight recovery in exports, the market remains uneasy, anticipating further restrictions.

This action by China affects industries worldwide, from electronics to automotive, underscoring the global economy's reliance on Chinese mineral supplies. The uncertainty could encourage more countries to seek alternative sources or enhance their own production capabilities.
