Judge Tanya Chutkan denied Trump's attempt to dismiss his election subversion case. Trump's team alleged he was targeted for political reasons. Chutkan dismissed this claim, concentrating on his alleged false statements and obstruction.

The case, which had been on hold since December, gained new momentum following the Supreme Court's ruling on presidential immunity. The high court's 6-3 decision clarified that while presidents enjoy broad immunity, it is not absolute. Chutkan now must determine which charges are valid.

Trump faces four counts for attempting to overturn his 2020 loss. His lawyers contend he is immune as a former president. The case continues with a status conference scheduled for August 16.

The US is upgrading its nuclear arsenal. Vipin Narang, acting US Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy, cites Russia's nuclear stance as the reason. Jill Hruby, US Under Secretary for Nuclear Security, detailed the modernization plans at the National Institute for Deterrence Studies.

The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) seeks a $25 billion budget for 2025. This includes:
- $21 billion for nuclear weapon stockpile maintenance.
- $2 billion for nuclear non-proliferation efforts.
- $2 billion for Navy nuclear propulsion systems.

The NNSA aims to replace all nuclear components and designs. Over 200 modernized weapons were delivered to the Department of Defense in 2023. The modernization spans the nuclear triad—land, air, and sea-based systems.

Key programs include:
- W88 Alteration 370 for Navy's Trident II D5 SLBM.
- B61-12 and B61-13 for newer aircraft compatibility.
- W80-4 for Air Force's Long Range Standoff Cruise Missile.
- W87-1 for land-based Minuteman III ICBM.
- W93 for ballistic missile submarines.
- Sea-Launched Cruise Missile-Nuclear (SLCM-N) for low-yield, non-ballistic capability.

Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister, Sergei Ryabkov, warns that US escalation could prompt Moscow to strengthen its nuclear deterrence. President Vladimir Putin considers adjusting Russia's nuclear doctrine due to the West's lowered nuclear use threshold. He denies Russia brandishes the "nuclear stick" and emphasizes the clear conditions for nuclear use in Russia's doctrine.

Ukrainian pilots now fly F-16s, announced Zelenskiy. These jets, long sought, arrived 29 months post-Russian invasion. At an undisclosed airbase, Zelenskiy addressed pilots, with two F-16s overhead.

"F-16s are in Ukraine. We did it. Proud of our guys mastering these jets," he said. The jets' impact on air defenses and the battlefield remains unclear. Russia targets potential F-16 bases, vowing to shoot them down.

Ukraine lacked enough trained pilots and jets. "Positive thing is we expect more F-16s... many guys training," Zelenskiy noted. Ukraine's Soviet-era planes were outmatched by Russia's advanced fleet.

Zelenskiy sees this as a new stage for Ukraine's air force. "We did a lot for Ukrainian forces to transition to western combat aviation," he said, highlighting relentless diplomacy.

The jets' missile range is unclear. Longer range could enhance battlefield impact. Zelenskiy hopes NATO countries might help intercept Russian missiles. "Another tool... I want to try it," he said, aiming to avoid excessive escalation fears.

Tropical glaciers in the Andes Mountains have shrunk to their smallest area in 11,700 years. Bedrock samples show that these glaciers have retreated to an unprecedented extent. As sensitive indicators of climate change, tropical glaciers are experiencing the impacts of modern global warming. Rising temperatures at high altitudes may be the cause of this retreat. The Andes Mountains, a hotspot for tropical glaciers, are among the first to be affected.

Cosmogenic carbon-14 (14C) and beryllium-10 (10Be) in bedrock samples are used to estimate the timing of glacier retreat. The results indicate that most samples have only recently been exposed, indicating a significant reduction in glacier area.

These small, rapidly responding glaciers may be a harbinger of future shrinkage of global glaciers.

  alt="Bronze Age Market Economies Discovered in Europe"

Researchers from Germany and Italy discovered evidence of market economies in Bronze Age Europe, approximately 3500 years ago. They analyzed over 20,000 metal artifacts from 1000 tombs across Italy, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, and Germany. These items, dating from 2300 BC to 800 BC, exhibited patterns reminiscent of contemporary spending habits.

The team observed that metal pieces were frequently broken into weights of about 10 grams, indicating their use as currency. This practice began around 1500 BC. Through the examination of the weights and distribution of these metal pieces, the researchers determined that a market economy, governed by supply and demand, was operational.

This discovery challenges the notion that market economies only emerged with the advent of modern states and coinage. It instead implies that market systems have been integral to human behavior for a considerably longer period, similar to war and marriage.

The findings, published in Nature Human Behaviour, surprised the researchers. They propose that the distinctions between what are termed "primitive" and "modern" cultures may be less pronounced than previously believed.

Tokyo's Shogakukan is planning an app called Novelous for North American fans of light novels. Set to launch this year, it will utilize AI translation technology from Tokyo startup Mantra, with the goal of offering 400 titles within two years.

Light novels, which are popular in Japan, combine anime-style illustrations with adolescent or fantasy storylines. Shogakukan aims to attract a million users by 2028, targeting revenues in the billions of yen. The app will include features such as vertical scrolling text and speech bubbles for enhanced readability.

Currently, only about 10 titles are available in English due to the high costs of translation. The app intends to increase both digital and print sales, including works from other publishers.

Competitor Kadokawa is a leader in overseas expansion, having acquired U.S. licensor J-Novel Club in 2021. Their light novel sales in North America are about a fifth of their manga sales.

The popularity of anime is driving demand for light novels. "The Apothecary Diaries" became a bestseller at Kinokuniya's U.S. stores following its anime adaptation. Kinokuniya's vice president views light novels as the next major trend after manga and anime.

Japan aims to quadruple its content exports to 20 trillion yen by 2033.

### New Dual-Action Antibiotic Combats Bacterial Resistance

New antibiotic, macrolones, strikes bacteria twice. It inhibits protein production and disrupts DNA, leaving bacteria unable to defend against both attacks simultaneously. This makes it more difficult for them to develop resistance. Macrolones are synthetic compounds that combine elements of erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. Erythromycin halts protein synthesis, while ciprofloxacin targets DNA gyrase, an enzyme crucial for bacterial function. Scientists suggest refining macrolones to enhance their effectiveness on both targets.

Researchers at the University of New South Wales studied platypus and chicken sex chromosomes, discovering fundamental differences in male and female biological processes. Their findings, published in PNAS, reveal a new dose compensation mechanism, distinct from humans.

In humans, females possess two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y. To maintain balance, one X in females is silenced, preventing them from producing twice the X protein of males.

Platypuses feature a unique system: females with five Xs, males with a mix of five Xs and Ys. Chickens utilize a ZW system, where males have two Zs and females one Z and one W. These systems exhibit mRNA imbalance between sexes but achieve protein balance through a novel dose compensation process.

This discovery challenges the notion that dose compensation only occurs at the mRNA level. It underscores the complexity of gene regulation and opens new avenues in understanding gene expression and protein production across species.

Future research will delve into these mechanisms, aiming to deepen our understanding of gene regulation and potentially lead to new therapies for diseases associated with protein dysfunction.
