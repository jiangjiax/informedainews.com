# World News Daily(2024-07-30) : BRICS Nations Represent 35% of Global GDP, Challenging Traditional Economic Paradigms

## BRICS Nations Represent 35% of Global GDP, Challenging Traditional Economic Paradigms

BRICS nations now hold 35% of global GDP, G7 at 30%. Trade among Southern countries surpasses North-South trade. This challenges the notion that developing nations primarily trade with Western counterparts. Russia pushes for global diversification, focusing on Southern regions, aiming to build resilient supply and production chains, less dependent on Western influence.

### Federal Court Rules US Border Agents Need Warrant for Device Searches

A federal court in New York has ruled that U.S. border agents must obtain a warrant before searching travelers' electronic devices. This decision challenges the government's long-standing policy allowing warrantless searches at borders.

Civil liberties groups praised the ruling, emphasizing the need for a warrant to protect personal privacy. Scott Wilkens, from the Knight First Amendment Institute, noted that electronic devices reveal much about a person's life.

The ruling affects the Eastern District of New York, including major airports like JFK. U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not comment on the ruling.

The case involved Kurbonali Sultanov, a U.S. citizen whose phone was searched at JFK without a warrant. He later sought to suppress evidence found on his phone, arguing the search violated his Fourth Amendment rights.

The court agreed that the search was unconstitutional but dismissed Sultanov's motion to suppress the evidence, stating the government acted in good faith.

CBP conducted over 41,700 device searches in 2023. Lawmakers have attempted to legislate warrant requirements for border searches, but these efforts have failed. The issue may eventually reach the Supreme Court.

### HIV Management and Prevention: Lessons from a Survivor's Journey

MacArthur Flournoy, 64, diagnosed with HIV in 1988, was told he had two years to live. Today, he's a grandfather living fully in Sacramento. HIV, once a death sentence, is now manageable with antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART prevents HIV-related deaths if taken consistently.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) drugs prevent HIV infection if taken as directed. PrEP is a daily pill or injection, while PEP is a 28-day course started within 72 hours of exposure. Both are free or covered by insurance.

Despite these advances, African Americans face higher HIV rates and lower PrEP usage. In 2022, they accounted for 39% of new HIV cases but only 14% of PrEP users. White Americans, by contrast, made up 24% of new cases and 64% of PrEP users.

Health experts call for increased awareness and access to testing and treatments. They stress the importance of knowing one's HIV status to take control of health. The goal is to reduce new HIV infections by 75% by 2025 and 90% by 2030, but progress has been slow.

Racism and implicit bias in healthcare contribute to these disparities. Efforts to address these issues must be accelerated. Education on racial biases in healthcare is crucial to improve outcomes for communities of color.

### G20 Advances Plan to Tax Ultra-Rich Individuals

  alt="G20 Advances Plan to Tax Ultra-Rich Individuals"
/>

The G20 has just moved closer to taxing the ultra-rich, with a proposed 2% levy on wealth exceeding $10 billion. This concept, promoted by Brazil, could potentially generate $2500 billion annually.

The journey towards implementing this "wealth tax" has been challenging. While France supports it, the U.S. has been cautious. The main obstacle is enforcement; tax havens and sophisticated loopholes make it difficult to tax the super-rich effectively.

The proposal, developed by economist Gabriel Zucman, points out a significant disparity: billionaires often pay less tax than ordinary citizens. In France, for example, billionaires pay only 27% of their income in taxes, compared to nearly 52% paid by most people.

The G20 recognizes that tax evasion by the wealthy undermines fairness and is preparing to intensify efforts. However, this requires complex international cooperation and domestic reforms.

The road ahead is arduous. Agreeing on a global wealth tax is a long-term endeavor, not a quick fix. The success of the global minimum corporate tax, set at 15%, provides a model, but taxing personal wealth is more complex and will take longer.

Ultimately, the G20's move to tax the super-rich represents a historic shift, but the true challenge lies in execution. It is a significant step towards balancing the economic playing field.

### Human Trials Begin for New Parkinson's Treatment Using Brain Cell Grafts

Brain cell grafts, transplanted into monkeys, have shown promise. Now, these grafts are moving to human trials for Parkinson's treatment.

Parkinson's disease, a neurological disorder, affects movement. It occurs when brain cells that produce dopamine die. Dopamine is crucial for smooth, coordinated muscle movement.

The treatment involves grafting new cells into the brain. These cells replace the lost dopamine producers. In monkeys, this approach reduced Parkinson's symptoms significantly.

The human trial aims to replicate these results. If successful, it could offer a new path for treating Parkinson's. This trial is a critical step from animal to human medicine.

My insight: Progress in medical science often starts with animals. Moving to human trials is a leap. Success here could mean a significant improvement in quality of life for Parkinson's patients. The simplicity and directness of this approach are promising.

  alt="Evolution of Western Equine Encephalitis Virus and Its Implications"
/>

Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) once caused severe outbreaks, but now rarely infects humans. A Harvard study in Nature reveals why: WEEV evolved to lose its ability to target human and horse cells. This shift correlates with reduced disease and death.

WEEV, part of the alphavirus family, uses spike proteins to attach to host cell receptors, then infects cells. Early WEEV strains could attach to multiple receptors, surprising researchers who thought viruses typically target one.

Recent WEEV strains lost this multi-receptor ability, focusing instead on bird receptors. This change might be due to vaccine-induced immunity in horses or random genetic mutations (antigenic drift).

The study highlights the importance of studying virus diversity over time and space. It warns against assuming viruses remain static. WEEV's resurgence in South America underscores the need for ongoing vigilance and research.

Understanding virus-host interactions is crucial for pandemic preparedness. The study provides tools to monitor and predict outbreaks, aiding in early response and prevention.

McDonald's is facing challenges. Sales have declined, particularly among low-income customers. They are promoting a $5 meal deal in an effort to regain their patronage. Joe Erlinger, the head of McDonald's USA, acknowledges that this is a strategic, long-term approach. They need to demonstrate that they are mindful of prices.

The $5 meal has been well-received, especially by low-income patrons. McDonald's is extending the offer beyond its initial four-week period. The majority of their restaurants are participating.

Erlinger concedes that business is not thriving. Customer numbers have fallen for the fourth consecutive quarter. They are losing market share to rivals. However, he remains optimistic. They have strategies in place for the remainder of the year, and upcoming decisions could potentially reverse the trend.

McDonald's has traditionally focused on providing value. Now, they must reinforce this commitment. They are engaging with customers and striving to narrow the affordability gap. The market is competitive, but McDonald's is committed to the long-term success of the business.
