# World News Daily(2024-08-14) : US Considers Breaking Up Google or Mandating Data Sharing

## US Considers Breaking Up Google or Mandating Data Sharing

Google's dominance in web search is facing scrutiny. The US Department of Justice has hinted at a possible breakup. Android, which is part of Alphabet, could be a target for divestment. This could impact pre-installed apps like Chrome and Gmail.

Alternatively, Google might be required to share search data, aligning with EU mandates. This could help even the competition. Exclusive agreements, such as Google's deal with Apple, are set to conclude. Apple is looking into new revenue sources, such as Patreon subscriptions.

Divestment refers to selling off parts of a company to reduce its size or focus on core activities.

### Ukraine's Bold Incursion: Strategic Gamble or Strategic Retreat?

Ukraine's recent incursion into Russia's Kursk oblast has stirred the pot. The move, bold and well-executed, showcased Ukraine's mastery of modern warfare, blending air defense, electronic warfare, armor, and infantry. This contrasts with last year's failed offensive.

The question now: stay or retreat? Staying could pressure Russia to shift troops from the Donbas, and provide a bargaining chip in future peace talks. Retreating, however, might undermine these goals.

Russia's reaction will be fierce. Putin views Ukraine's presence on Russian soil as intolerable. Expect increased attacks as Russia tries to reclaim the territory.

The gamble's success remains uncertain. Sustaining the incursion and holding the territory will be challenging, especially with lengthening supply lines.

This move is Ukraine's boldest yet, and its riskiest. The outcome will shape the conflict's trajectory.

Windfall Bio, a California startup, utilizes methane-consuming microbes known as "mems" to convert methane into fertilizer. Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, originates from agriculture, landfills, and oil production. Windfall's technique involves placing these microbes near methane sources. The mems consume methane and produce clean fertilizer.

Josh Silverman, Windfall's CEO, explains their strategy: customers place mems packets near methane sources. Farmers, dairy operators, and oil companies can use the resulting fertilizer or sell it back to Windfall. This method bypasses the high energy consumption and carbon emissions associated with traditional fertilizer production.

Windfall has experienced high demand, operating on every continent. They plan a pilot with Whole Foods' dairy suppliers to reduce methane emissions. Backed by notable investors, including Amazon and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Windfall has raised $37 million.

This innovation could significantly contribute to global climate efforts by reducing methane emissions and providing a sustainable source of fertilizer.

Didi, a 42-year-old woman in Shanghai, won the right to monthly visits with her daughter after a four-year separation. This marks a first in Chinese courts, recognizing a child can have two legal mothers. Didi and her ex-wife, now estranged, married in the US in 2016 and underwent IVF treatment. Didi gave birth to their daughter in 2017, while her wife gave birth to a son.

The Beijing court's decision is a milestone for LGBT rights in China, though Didi's son remains out of reach. Chinese law lacks clear provisions for same-sex couples, especially in shared motherhood scenarios. Didi's case highlights the legal complexities faced by LGBT families.

Despite the victory, Didi's access to her son is denied, reflecting ongoing challenges in Chinese legal recognition of same-sex families. The case has sparked discussions on social media and in academic circles, advocating for legal reforms to catch up with societal changes. Didi hopes for incremental legal recognition of same-sex households in China.

Starbucks replaced CEO Laxman Narasimhan with Chipotle's Brian Niccol. Starbucks stock jumped 24.5%, a record high. Chipotle's stock dropped 10% with Niccol's departure.

Narasimhan's exit was immediate. Starbucks CFO Rachel Ruggeri will lead temporarily until Niccol starts on Sept. 9. Narasimhan, previously at Reckitt, struggled with weak sales in the U.S. and China.

Niccol, known for his success at Chipotle and Taco Bell, boosted Chipotle's stock by 773%. He navigated Chipotle through a food scandal and the pandemic, maintaining sales growth.

Activist investors Elliott Management and Starboard Value supported Niccol. Elliott had discussed Starbucks' issues with the board, pushing for change.

Starbucks' board considered Narasimhan's lack of restaurant experience a drawback. They see Niccol as a quick fix, confident in his industry expertise.

Niccol's focus on Chipotle's app and digital ordering contrasts with Starbucks' mobile order issues. Chipotle's digital strategy includes dedicated lines and "Chipotlanes" for app orders.

Narasimhan's ouster suggests Starbucks' board is not keen on deals with activists. Elliott had proposed a settlement to protect Narasimhan's position, but the board moved forward with Niccol.

  alt="New Adhesive Shields Medical Devices from Immune Response"

Scientists at MIT have developed a new adhesive material that prevents fibrosis, a scarring process that can disable implanted medical devices like pacemakers. This adhesive, dubbed a "non-fibrotic adhesive," bonds the device to surrounding tissue, shielding it from the body's immune response.

Typically, when a foreign object is implanted, the body reacts by forming a fibrous capsule around it, which can impair the device's function. This new adhesive prevents this by creating a strong bond between the device and the tissue, essentially camouflaging the device.

The adhesive is made from polymers like chitosan or polyvinyl alcohol, materials that are cheap, widely available, and mechanically compatible with human tissue. It has been tested in various animal models, including mice, rats, and pigs, with promising results across different organs.

This innovation could extend the lifespan and effectiveness of implanted devices, from pacemakers to sensors and drug delivery systems. The researchers are now working towards human trials, aiming to bring this technology to clinical use within the next few years.

  alt="New HIV Treatment Shows Promising Results in Preliminary Tests"

Leor Weinberger, a biophysicist at the University of California, San Francisco, has been working on a novel approach to combat HIV. His strategy involves injecting a modified, harmless version of HIV into patients. This "therapeutic interfering particle" (TIP) is designed to suppress the natural HIV virus.

In a recent study published in *Science*, Weinberger and his team demonstrated that a single injection of TIP into monkeys infected with a hybrid virus (SHIV) significantly reduced the viral load—from about 100 million to 10,000 copies per milliliter of blood. This reduction lasted for several weeks.

The potential benefits of TIP are clear: it could provide a simpler, more effective treatment for HIV, especially for those who struggle with daily medication. However, the risks are also significant. TIP could potentially trigger harmful immune reactions or even lead to HIV relapse.

Despite these concerns, the preliminary results are promising. If TIP proves safe and effective in human trials, it could revolutionize HIV treatment and potentially help curb the global epidemic.

Starbucks has revamped its leadership, removing Laxman Narasimhan from the CEO position. Taking his place is Brian Niccol, the former head of Chipotle. Following this announcement, the company's shares surged by 24.5%.

Jim Cramer, a CNBC commentator, applauded the decision. He contended that Narasimhan, coming from a background in consulting and packaged goods, was not the ideal fit. According to Cramer, Starbucks required a leader with expertise in the fast-food industry.

Niccol's time at Chipotle was marked by success. He enhanced food quality, improved store efficiency, and optimized customer flow. Cramer pointed out Niccol's measured approach to expanding the menu, which sharply contrasts with Starbucks' recent over-expansion.

Cramer views Niccol as pivotal for Starbucks' resurgence. He believes Niccol can reinstate Starbucks as the "third place"—neither home nor work, but Starbucks. The recovery process may not be swift, but it is expected to occur.

Starbucks has not provided any comments regarding this leadership change.
