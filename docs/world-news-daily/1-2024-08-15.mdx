Kishida, Japan's PM, withdraws from the LDP presidency race in September. Low approval ratings and a funding scandal compelled his decision. A new leader for the world's fourth-largest economy is set to emerge. Potential successors include Shigeru Ishiba, Taro Kono, and possibly Japan's first female PM. The new leader will face international uncertainty, the US election, and domestic cost crises.

A US judge has ruled that Google's search monopoly is illegal. The Justice Department is considering breaking up Alphabet’s Google, which is valued at $2 trillion. Potential actions include divesting Android, selling AdWords, and Chrome. Google intends to appeal.

Antitrust laws are designed to prevent monopolies and ensure fair competition. In 2021, Google spent over $26 billion to maintain its default status on Safari, thereby suppressing competition. This ruling represents a significant victory in the fight against the market dominance of big tech companies.

### US doubts over effectiveness of China chip restrictions: China's military AI capabilities strengthen

  alt="US doubts over effectiveness of China chip restrictions: China's military AI capabilities strengthen"

Starting from October 2022, the United States has tightened export controls on chips to China, aiming to limit China's access to high-end semiconductors used in military AI. However, investigations show that China can still obtain these chips for military research through shell companies and smuggling routes.

The U.S. Department of Commerce has introduced strict export control regulations, including a ban on the sale of NVIDIA's H100 chip. But research by The New York Times and the Center for Advanced Defense Studies indicates that government-linked entities in China have purchased these banned chips through various means.

Legal experts point out that the issue lies with intermediaries, not chip manufacturers. U.S. companies do not want their products to end up in the hands of undesirable end users. The enforcement of export controls is akin to a "cat and mouse" game, with Chinese entities evading regulations by changing names.

Meanwhile, the U.S. chip ban on China has sparked backlash. Critics argue that this has left market space for Chinese tech companies like Huawei. Huawei is set to release the "Ascend 910C" chip, which is expected to be comparable to NVIDIA's H100.

The U.S. government is considering further tightening restrictions on Chinese chips, including limiting the export of equipment and software made with U.S. technology to China. This move aims to further curb China's ability to acquire critical chip technologies.

Ukrainian drones have struck Russian airbases in Voronezh, Kursk, Savasleyka, and Borisoglebsk, which are known to launch warplanes that bomb Ukraine. Ukraine claims to have shot down a Russian Su-34 and captured 100 Russian soldiers in Kursk.

Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko is working to establish a buffer zone in Kursk to protect border communities from Russian attacks. The Belgorod region in Russia is also under emergency status due to Ukrainian strikes.

Ukraine’s long-term plans in Kursk are unclear. The longer the incursion continues, the more challenging it becomes for Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Russian elite are closely observing whether he can maintain control.

Ukraine is offering humanitarian corridors for civilians to evacuate to both Russia and Ukraine. International aid groups, including the Red Cross and the UN, will have access.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is discussing the humanitarian situation and plans for a military commandant’s office in occupied areas. Ukraine controls the Russian town of Sudzha, a key gas transit hub, but has no plans to claim Russian land.

The rouble continues to decline against the dollar since the incursion began.

Intense fighting continues in Ukraine’s Donetsk region. Zelenskiy promises additional weapons from Western support.

Russian drones attacked a medical vehicle in Kharkiv, resulting in the death of a medic and injuries to others. A Russian ballistic missile struck Odesa’s port infrastructure, injuring a port worker and a grain carrier driver.

China’s special envoy has discussed the war with Pope Francis’s peace envoy. Mali’s Tuareg rebels deny receiving help from Ukraine in recent clashes with Russian Wagner mercenaries.

  alt="Bird DNA Reveals Clues to Dinosaur Extinction"
/>

66 million years ago, a rock struck Earth with great force. Dinosaurs, with the exception of birds, disappeared. Birds flourished, now boasting over 10,000 species.

Scientists discovered DNA changes in birds linked to that impact. Alterations in DNA base ratios modified bird characteristics. Birds became smaller and required more care as chicks.

Jake Berv, a bird expert at Michigan University, utilized new software to analyze these DNA shifts. He concentrated on the 500,000 years following the impact. He identified significant changes in bird size and development.

This study, unique in linking DNA shifts to a mass extinction, demonstrates the profound impacts of such events. Daniel Field, a Cambridge paleontologist, highlights the significant genetic changes caused by major extinctions.

The research, published in Science Advances, emphasizes how past catastrophes shape the blueprint of life.

### Tiny Wasps Used for Eco-Friendly Moth Control

  alt="Tiny Wasps Used for Eco-Friendly Moth Control"
/>

Rentokil's innovative pest control employs tiny wasps, measuring less than 0.5mm, to combat moth infestations. These wasps deposit their eggs within moth eggs, preventing larvae from emerging. This technique eschews toxic sprays and safeguards delicate textiles in museums and residences.

The wasps are introduced through sachets placed in areas prone to moths, providing a consistent release over several weeks. They actively seek out new moth eggs until the infestation is eradicated.

Known as "entosite," this method is both non-toxic and effective, particularly for valuable textiles. It is part of a larger movement towards "biological control"—utilizing natural predators to manage pest populations.

Scientists such as Prof. Charles Godfray at Oxford endorse this approach, citing its proven effectiveness in controlling pests like mealybugs in Africa and whiteflies in UK greenhouses. This strategy not only protects crops but also presents a safer alternative to chemical pesticides.

### MIT Releases Comprehensive AI Risk Repository

MIT researchers have compiled a database of AI risks, aiming to guide policymakers and industry stakeholders. The repository, dubbed an "AI risk repository," catalogs over 700 risks, categorized by factors like intentionality and domains such as discrimination.

Peter Slattery, lead researcher, highlights the repository's purpose: to provide a comprehensive, accessible database that updates over time. Existing risk frameworks often overlook significant risks, with some covering as little as 20% of identified subdomains.

The repository, developed in collaboration with multiple institutions, includes risks often neglected in other frameworks, such as AI-generated spam and pollution of the information ecosystem.

Slattery emphasizes the repository's potential to streamline risk assessment, saving time and enhancing oversight. However, its impact on actual regulation remains uncertain. The MIT team plans to use the repository to evaluate how well different risks are being addressed, aiming to identify and rectify gaps in organizational responses.

### Two Major Aging Bursts Identified at Ages 44 and 60

Scientists tracked 108 volunteers, aged 25 to 75, monitoring 135,000 molecules and microbes in their bodies. They identified two major aging bursts: one around 44, another at 60.

The first burst affects molecules linked to heart disease and the metabolism of caffeine, alcohol, and fats. The second impacts immune function, carbohydrate metabolism, and kidney health. Skin and muscle aging molecules shift at both stages.

Initially, researchers thought the 44-year burst was skewed by perimenopause in women. However, similar changes were noted in men, suggesting broader factors.

The study, published in Nature Aging, aligns with prior evidence showing a sharp rise in Alzheimer's and heart disease risks post-60. Some changes might reflect lifestyle shifts, like increased alcohol consumption during mid-life stress.

### Premier League to Replace VAR with iPhone-Based 'Dragon' System

The English Premier League plans to replace its flawed VAR system for offside calls with a new technology named "Dragon," set to debut in the 2024-2025 season. This system utilizes iPhones—at least 28 of them—mounted around the pitch.

Each waterproof enclosure contains up to four iPhones, equipped with fans and power sources, capturing high-frame-rate video that feeds into a software tool. The result is a system that tracks between 7,000 and 10,000 points on each player, significantly more than previous technologies.

The software of the "Dragon" system is based on machine learning, trained on soccer footage to identify offside situations. While AI highlights potential issues, a human referee makes the final decision.

The Premier League asserts that "Dragon" has been tested and validated by FIFA. However, fans are likely to remain skeptical until they see its performance firsthand.

Olympic boxing champion Imane Khelif has filed a lawsuit in France, accusing J.K. Rowling, Elon Musk, and potentially Donald Trump of cyberbullying. Khelif, Algeria’s first gold medalist in women’s boxing, faced gender controversy during her Olympic run.

Khelif was banned from the 2023 boxing world championships for failing a gender test but was cleared by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the Paris Olympics. The IOC disputed the test and removed the International Boxing Association (IBA) as boxing’s governing body.

Khelif, born female, never identified as transgender or intersex. The IOC confirmed her eligibility, stating “scientifically, this is not a man fighting a woman.”

Rowling and Musk amplified the controversy on social media. Rowling criticized the situation as male violence against women in sports. Musk supported the exclusion of men from women’s sports.

Khelif’s attorney, Nabil Boudi, filed a criminal complaint for cyber-harassment, targeting unknown persons and high-profile figures. The lawsuit aims to investigate all involved, regardless of pseudonyms or fame.

Khelif and her coach, Pedro Diaz, described the bullying as deeply affecting her and her team. Despite the harassment, Khelif emphasized her qualification and womanhood, calling her detractors “enemies of success.”
