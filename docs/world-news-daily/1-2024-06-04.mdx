Chang'e 6: A Sampling Journey to the Lunar Far Side

At 7:38 AM today, Chang'e 6 successfully lifted off from the lunar far side, carrying precious lunar samples into the predetermined orbit. This marks the world's first successful sampling and launch from the lunar far side.

Video footage captured Chang'e 6 ingeniously collecting lunar soil through both drilling tools and robotic arms in the extreme environment of the lunar far side. This "collect-as-you-drill" sampling method ensured the diversity and richness of the samples.

From June 2 to 3, Chang'e 6 completed intelligent rapid sampling in the South Pole-Aitken Basin on the lunar far side and safely sealed the samples. Subsequently, the ascent vehicle will dock with the orbiter and returner combination in lunar orbit to transfer the samples. The combination will then wait for the right moment to bring the samples back to Earth, with a planned landing at the Siziwang Banner landing site in Inner Mongolia.

These operations not only showcase China's space technology but also contribute valuable data and samples to global lunar scientific research.

Russia targets Paris Olympics with deepfake Tom Cruise video.

A Kremlin-linked group, Storm-1679, created a fake documentary titled "Olympics Has Fallen," featuring a deepfake Tom Cruise. This documentary, falsely attributed to Netflix, criticizes the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and spreads fear of violence during the games.

Storm-1679 also produced spoof news reports and digitally generated images of graffiti threatening violence, aiming to undermine the Paris Olympics. Russia has a history of such tactics, including the Soviet Union's boycott of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.

Microsoft warns that these malign influence campaigns will likely expand, using more advanced AI to create convincing disinformation. This echoes similar tactics observed by China, which uses AI-generated material to interfere in foreign elections.

The use of AI in disinformation campaigns is a growing threat, blurring the lines between truth and fabrication, and undermining trust in media and institutions.

### Massive Fine for US Dog Breeder Amidst Animal Cruelty Scandal

Envigo RMS LLC, a US dog breeder for medical testing, faced a $35 million fine for animal cruelty after 4,000 beagles were rescued from its Virginia facility in 2022. This fine, the largest under the Animal Welfare Act, reflects severe neglect: dogs were denied basic veterinary care, fed contaminated food, and housed in unsafe conditions. Envigo's parent company, Inotiv, accepted the penalty and committed to stopping dog breeding for five years. The rescue effort triggered a nationwide campaign to find homes for the beagles.

This case highlights a profit-driven culture that compromises animal welfare and environmental standards. Envigo's negligence also included violations of the Clean Water Act, mishandling wastewater, and further jeopardizing the dogs and the environment. The settlement involves significant payments to the US government, the Virginia Animal Fighting Task Force, and the Humane Society for their involvement in the rescue.

This incident raises crucial questions about the ethics of animal testing and the oversight of such practices. It serves as a stark reminder of the responsibilities companies have in balancing profit with humane treatment and environmental stewardship.

  alt="Global Wealth Urged to Contribute More to Climate Solutions"
/>

Global wealth must contribute more to climate solutions, says Laurence Tubiana, key architect of the Paris Agreement. A global wealth tax or consumption charges are proposed, with Brazil supporting such measures. Poor nations struggle to fund climate adaptation, needing around $1tn annually.

Ideas include a frequent flyer levy, targeting the wealthy who fly more, and a carbon tax on international shipping. The richest 1% emit more greenhouse gases than the poorest 66%, yet suffer less from climate impacts. Tubiana emphasizes the need for social justice in climate measures to maintain public support.

The International Tax Task Force, co-chaired by Tubiana, explores funding ideas. Climate finance is a key focus at the upcoming UN climate summit, Cop29. While governments acknowledge the need for tax reform, national sovereignty complicates international taxation agreements.

The ITTF will rename itself to avoid legal and political sensitivities around the term "tax." Tubiana is optimistic about wealthy individuals' cooperation, especially younger generations.

Discussions also address how funds should be allocated, considering not just poverty but vulnerability to climate shocks. A "universal vulnerability index" is suggested to assess aid needs fairly, recognizing that traditional economic indicators may not reflect a country's ability to withstand climate disasters.

### Juror Receives $120,000 Bribe Attempt in Minnesota Fraud Trial

A juror in a Minnesota fraud trial reported receiving a bag of $120,000 cash, with a promise of more if she acquitted seven defendants accused of stealing over $40 million meant for child feeding programs during the pandemic. These defendants, part of a larger group of 70, allegedly misused funds intended for feeding low-income children, diverting the money to luxury purchases.

The trial, which commenced in April, has witnessed defense attorneys questioning the FBI's investigation, arguing that discrepancies in record-keeping, rather than fraud, are at play. The initial seven defendants are associated with a restaurant that participated in the food aid program. The founder of Feeding Our Future, one of the implicated nonprofits, has entered a plea of not guilty.

Upon receiving the cash, the juror promptly reported it to the police. Concerned about the trial's integrity, the judge opted to sequester the jury and confiscate the defendants' phones.

This case underscores the susceptibility of emergency relief programs to exploitation and emphasizes the critical need for rigorous oversight and accountability in the allocation of public funds.

Mexico's Claudia Sheinbaum, a 61-year-old climate scientist, secured the presidency with a landslide 59.5% of the vote, becoming the nation's first female leader. Her party, Morena, is poised to achieve a supermajority in Congress, granting unprecedented legislative power, including the ability to amend the constitution without opposition.

Sheinbaum's victory builds on the populist policies of her predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador (Amlo), who founded Morena and remains influential. Her mandate includes addressing persistent issues of violence, corruption, and the expanding role of the military in civilian affairs, which Amlo had escalated.

The election also marked significant gains for women in Mexican politics, with gender parity goals leading to a near-equal split of congressional seats and cabinet positions. This shift could influence policies on abortion rights and gender-based violence, areas where progress has been slow.

Internationally, Sheinbaum's administration will face complex dynamics, particularly with the U.S., given Mexico's role in trade, drug trafficking, and immigration. Her approach to these challenges will be closely watched, especially as the U.S. prepares for its own pivotal election.

In summary, Sheinbaum's historic win and the supermajority her party enjoys present both opportunities and formidable challenges for Mexico, domestically and in its foreign relations.

Coldplay, the British band, has significantly reduced its touring carbon footprint by 59% compared to their previous world tour. This reduction was achieved through innovative methods such as kinetic dancefloors, where dancing fans generate electricity, and the use of recyclable LED wristbands. The band also traveled by train to further minimize emissions.

In 2021, Coldplay announced a plan to lower emissions during their Music of the Spheres world tour, which began in 2022. They aimed to cut carbon emissions by at least 50% from show production, freight, and travel. Two years into the tour, they have exceeded this goal, partly due to fan participation in charging concerts using power bikes and kinetic dancefloors.

The band has also implemented measures to reduce waste, with 72% of tour waste being diverted from landfill for reuse, recycling, and composting. Additionally, for every ticket sold, a tree is planted through a global reforestation nonprofit.

Coldplay's efforts have been praised by MIT Professor John E Fernandez, who noted their leadership in pushing the music industry towards sustainability. Despite relying on air travel for most shows, frontman Chris Martin has committed to using public transport where possible, demonstrating a commitment to sustainable touring practices.

Kinetic dancefloors: Specialized floors that convert the energy from people jumping or dancing into electrical energy.
Recyclable LED wristbands: Light-emitting diode wristbands that can be recycled after use.
Carbon footprint: The total amount of greenhouse gases produced to directly and indirectly support human activities, usually expressed in equivalent tons of carbon dioxide (CO2).
