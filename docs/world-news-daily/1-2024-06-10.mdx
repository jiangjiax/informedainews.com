On the final day of European Parliament elections, hundreds of millions queue to vote, shaping the continent's political landscape. These pivotal elections, especially significant since Brexit, will determine the 720 lawmakers in the EU's transnational parliament. Predictions suggest a shift towards the radical and far-right, although mainstream pro-European groups are expected to maintain a majority.

The European Parliament, which once served primarily as a forum for discussion, now holds substantial legislative power over critical areas such as climate action and AI. The outcome of these elections will also influence Ursula von der Leyen's chances for a second term as European Commission President.

Germany's Greens, facing controversies over domestic climate laws, and France's Macron-led centrists, currently lagging behind Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally, are at risk of significant losses. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's growing influence could reshape the political blocs, possibly strengthening a more unified right-wing faction.

The turnout, especially among the youth, is closely monitored, with recent initiatives aimed at engaging younger voters yielding promising results. As the polls close, the EU's future trajectory remains uncertain, heavily dependent on the results of these elections.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warns of a potential governance vacuum in Gaza following an Israeli withdrawal, which could lead to a resurgence of Hamas. Worldwide, nonstate armed groups are increasing in power, offering essential services and governance in regions where national governments fail. These groups, including Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Taliban, operate both militarily and civilly, often grounded in religious beliefs.

In 2023, it is estimated that 195 million people lived under the rule of such groups, which frequently mimic state functions by collecting taxes, administering justice, and providing healthcare. This trend challenges the post-WWII international order, where sovereign states were the standard. As U.S. influence diminishes, multilateral polarization grows, with adversaries such as Iran and Russia leveraging these groups to challenge Western dominance.

The complexity of applying international law to nonstate actors and the perceived Western double standards in conflicts like Gaza undermine global trust in Western-led law and order. Developed nations must reevaluate their strategies to maintain influence in a shifting global order.

### Recycling Copper for Sustainable Electrical Demand

In Montreal, a foundry transforms scrap copper into usable rods, essential for meeting the growing demand for electricity. As the world transitions to clean energy, the demand for copper is projected to nearly double by 2035. Recycling copper saves 200 tons of rock per ton of metal, significantly reducing the environmental impact of mining. Copper, which can be recycled indefinitely without degradation, is crucial; without it, our electricity-dependent society would struggle.

Aluminum, another conductive material, requires substantial energy to produce, making copper increasingly attractive as energy costs escalate. Two-thirds of the copper produced in the last century is still in use, indicating a substantial future recycling potential. Embracing this "urban mine" not only enhances the supply of copper but also minimizes the need for new mining, thereby reducing its environmental impact.

The Bank of Japan (BOJ) is under scrutiny as it contemplates reducing bond purchases, a move that might herald the onset of quantitative tightening. Economists predict a decrease from the current 6 trillion yen monthly purchases, with the goal of stabilizing the yen, which recently reached a 34-year low against the dollar. The BOJ's balance sheet, historically expanded to stimulate the economy, may now shrink, indicating a shift in monetary policy under Governor Kazuo Ueda.

Market anticipation centers on a reduction in bond purchases, with particular attention on the scale and timing of such a move. A substantial cut could push bond yields higher, complicating the BOJ's mission to preserve economic stability. Economists are split on whether this signifies the start of quantitative tightening, with some seeing any reduction as a move towards a smaller balance sheet.

Ueda's careful approach, stressing gradual policy adjustments to prevent economic disruption, highlights the intricate balance between market expectations and government intervention. As the BOJ confronts these challenges, its actions will be closely observed for indications of a new monetary era.

NASA's James Webb Telescope has revealed a galaxy, JADES-GS-z14-0, dating back to just 2.9 billion years after the Big Bang. This galaxy, with a redshift of 14.32, breaks previous records, suggesting an unexpectedly swift formation of galaxies in the universe's early stages.

The discovery, part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), employed the telescope's Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Spectrograph (NIRSpec) to capture and analyze the light from this distant galaxy. The high redshift indicates that the light has been stretched to longer, redder wavelengths due to the universe's expansion, enabling Webb's instruments to detect it.

This galaxy's luminosity and size—over 1600 light-years in diameter—imply a mass several hundred million times that of the Sun, challenging existing theories on early galaxy formation. Furthermore, the presence of oxygen suggests that multiple generations of massive stars had already formed and perished, enriching the galaxy with heavy elements.

These findings not only establish a new distance record but also underscore the complexity and rapid evolution of galaxies in the early universe. This discovery provides a fresh perspective on the initial stages of cosmic structure formation.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is investigating small, potentially habitable exoplanets, analyzing their atmospheres using transmission spectroscopy. This task is intricate due to the subtle signals and prolonged observation times needed. Exoplanets, abundant in our galaxy, orbit within habitable zones around stars, though not all are assured to harbor life.

JWST concentrates on transiting exoplanets, whose orbital alignments allow direct observation of their atmospheres. Identifying atmospheric components, particularly water vapor and biosignatures, is challenging due to the thin atmospheres of rocky planets and the obscuring effects of clouds or haze.

Recent research on exoplanet LHS 1140 b indicates that detecting biosignatures might necessitate up to 200 hours of observation under optimal conditions. The concept of ocean planets, featuring thin hydrogen atmospheres above extensive liquid water oceans, presents a novel approach for biosignature detection.

JWST's capabilities facilitate the sensitive detection of crucial life-indicating molecules. Although definitive evidence of habitability is still elusive, JWST's discoveries will guide future missions, such as the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, setting the stage for a dedicated observatory to search for life on Earth-like planets.

The quest for life beyond Earth is demanding, requiring ideal conditions and extensive observation. However, this pursuit is vital, as each discovery brings us closer to comprehending our cosmic context.

Researchers at UC San Diego have uncovered a key aspect of brain aging, particularly in Alzheimer's patients, using a novel technique called MUSIC. This method allows scientists to examine interactions within individual brain cells, revealing that certain cells age faster than others. Notably, these aging cells are more prevalent in Alzheimer's patients.

The study also highlights a gender difference: in female brains, there are more aged oligodendrocytes—cells that provide insulation for neurons—compared to aged neurons. This imbalance could potentially explain why women are at higher risk for neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.

MUSIC, which stands for "single-cell multi-omic sequencing of chromatin interactions," provides a detailed look at how DNA and RNA interact within cells. By understanding these interactions, researchers hope to pinpoint specific genes or pathways that lead to accelerated cell aging. Targeting these elements could lead to new treatments for slowing brain aging and mitigating the effects of Alzheimer's disease.
