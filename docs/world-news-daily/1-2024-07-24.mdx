### Temu's Rapid Growth and Strategic Market Expansion

Temu, the cross-border e-commerce platform under Pinduoduo, has surpassed its sales target for the first half of the year, achieving over $20 billion in sales, far exceeding the annual goal of $18 billion. This growth rate has outpaced its competitors, SHEIN and TikTok, which took nine and three years respectively to reach $20 billion in sales.

Temu's expansion strategy has transitioned from a "full consignment" to a "semi-consignment" model. Under the "semi-consignment" model, sellers are responsible for logistics, whereas the "full consignment" model was managed by Temu. This change has expanded the variety of products and reduced costs.

The platform has benefited from the U.S. "de minimis" rule, which exempts import duties on goods under $800. However, with potential policy changes under the Trump administration, Temu is diversifying its market focus, planning to reduce its U.S. sales ratio from 60% to 30%.

Temu is also expanding its "semi-consignment" model globally, starting with Europe, following initial success in the U.S. This model targets Amazon sellers with mature logistics capabilities, providing them with a platform to clear inventory.

Competition with Amazon is intensifying, as Amazon has launched a "low-price store" similar to Temu's "full consignment". This move not only directly competes with Temu but also exacerbates the tension in international shipping resources, potentially leading to increased costs.

Temu's strategy to expand its "semi-consignment" model is crucial for its continued growth and adaptation to market and policy changes.

### Addressing Complex Health Needs in Canada: A Call for Team-Based Care

Canada's health care system is under strain due to complex patient needs and a shortage of doctors. Six million Canadians do not have a family physician. Emergency rooms are overwhelmed, and wait times for surgeries are increasing.

Dr. Kathleen Ross, president of the Canadian Medical Association (CMA), advocates for team-based care. Her clinic refers patients to counselors and dietitians to address various health needs. British Columbia funds six counseling sessions, while dietitian services are limited and specific to certain conditions.

High demand forces patients to seek care at crowded walk-in clinics and emergency rooms, which lack comprehensive follow-up care. Long waits for MRIs and surgeries have led provinces to expand private surgical centers and virtual care options. Quebec plans to restrict private nursing agencies.

The CMA proposes a combination of public and private funding, with equity in care being a priority. Goals include expanding interprofessional primary care teams to serve half of Canadians within five years. The CMA opposes user fees for publicly insured primary care.

Dr. Danielle Martin supports broader access to team-based care, highlighting the role of physiotherapists in managing conditions such as lower-back pain. She emphasizes the importance of reducing wait times, which is crucial for aging Canadians needing complex care.

Norma Luks appreciates the comprehensive care provided by her family health team, contrasting it with the challenges of solo practice. Despite these advantages, her team is not accepting new patients.

The CMA is seeking further consultation to refine its recommendations, aiming for a finalization by fall.
