European powers are intensifying their presence in Asia, conducting joint defense drills with Japan amidst escalating tensions with China. Italy, Germany, France, and other nations are deploying ships and aircraft, signaling a strategic shift towards the Asian region. Japan, historically aligned with the U.S., is now broadening its security partnerships, participating in nearly 30 drills near its borders this year—marking a significant increase.

This development mirrors global concerns regarding Asian stability, especially the safety of sea lanes and critical supplies. NATO's influence is expanding in the region, with Japan committing to a defense spending target of 2% of its GDP. This engagement is fraught with tension; recent incidents involving Dutch and Chinese forces illustrate the precarious equilibrium.

Japan's strategic goal is to maintain a "free and open Indo-Pacific," countering China's growing military activities around its territories. The evolving alliances and exercises underscore a complex geopolitical landscape, where traditional ties are being tested and new partnerships are being established.

In the rural south of the Netherlands, a plan is unfolding to deploy F-16 jets over Ukraine this summer. Delays have plagued the delivery and training of these jets, which Ukraine has sought for over a year. Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Norway have pledged 80 F-16s, marking a significant upgrade from Ukraine's Soviet-era MiGs and Sukhois.

The training is intensive, encompassing not only pilots but also technicians and maintainers. The complexity of the F-16, featuring advanced radar and autonomy for pilots, starkly contrasts with Ukraine's existing fleet. This transition could shift the war's dynamics, compelling Russia to reassess its tactics, especially its use of KAB guided air bombs against cities like Kharkiv.

The Netherlands' defense minister, Kajsa Ollongren, recognizes the urgency while stressing the importance of comprehensive preparation. She also points out that Ukraine could employ these jets for defensive strikes within Russia, in compliance with international law.

The introduction of F-16s signifies a strategic leap for Ukraine, potentially tipping the balance in their favor, provided the deployment aligns with operational readiness rather than political expediency.

OECD reports a sharp drop in fertility rates among its 38 member countries, reaching a record low of 1.5 in 2022, down from 3.3 in 1960. The essential rate for population stability, 2.1, is only met by Israel. Notably, South Korea's rate stands at a mere 0.8, expected to drop to 0.7 in 2023. Factors contributing to this decline include later childbearing and economic pressures, with housing costs being a significant deterrent.

The trend towards childlessness is particularly pronounced in Italy, Spain, and Japan, where between a quarter and nearly a third of women remain childless. This reflects broader societal changes where economic independence and housing challenges complicate the path to parenthood.

Policy recommendations emphasize enhancing gender equality and providing financial support for families. However, even with these measures, achieving the replacement fertility level appears unlikely. Therefore, strategies such as immigration and extending working lives are proposed to adapt to a future characterized by lower birth rates.

This demographic shift highlights a significant transformation in societal structures and economic dynamics, requiring innovative approaches to maintain economic vitality and social cohesion.

To grill effectively, start with the fish skin-side down until crispy, then flip. A brief soak in cold, salt-vinegar water can help eliminate any fishy taste. Simple seasonings like citrus marinades, blackened seasoning, or just salt and pepper enhance the natural flavors. For a spicy twist, consider a Korean bulgogi marinade.

Tools like grill mats and baskets prevent delicate fish from falling apart, ensuring a clean grilling experience. Tuna, known for its rich flavor, requires minimal seasoning and careful, brief cooking to avoid overdoing it. Salmon, versatile and healthy, benefits from various accompaniments, while swordfish, with its meaty texture, pairs well with bold flavors like citrus or herbs.

Selecting the right fish and techniques can transform your grill into a seafood haven, bringing the freshness of the sea to your backyard.
