Britain will return the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, ending a long-standing dispute. The UK expelled Chagossians in the 1960s and 1970s, retaining the islands as the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT). Mauritius has long argued for sovereignty, a position supported by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the UN General Assembly, and the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea (ITLOS). Britain was found to have unlawfully separated the islands before Mauritius's independence. Despite initial resistance, the UK has now agreed to return the islands.

Singapore is tightening its anti-money laundering rules in real estate and legal sectors. Real estate brokers and lawyers must now screen clients acting for third parties. This move aims to prevent criminals from using these sectors to launder money.

The new measures follow a review prompted by the arrest of a Chinese gang in 2023. They laundered over $2.34 billion, including buying luxury properties. The review found gaps in implementation practices among "gatekeepers"—professionals who oversee financial integrity.

Singapore's Minister of State for Trade and Industry, Alvin Tan, emphasized the need to protect legitimate activities while thwarting illegal ones. The government will provide details on the changes in the coming months.

Beyond real estate and legal sectors, Singapore is also scrutinizing other businesses like car dealerships and art boutiques for potential money laundering. Officials plan to engage with these sectors to enhance reporting of suspicious activities.

A new platform, Navigate, is being developed to consolidate money laundering risk information across government agencies. This aims to identify and address concerns more effectively.

Indranee Rajah, Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office, acknowledged that no system is foolproof. However, the government is committed to swift and effective enforcement once money laundering is detected.

Federal prosecutors allege that Donald Trump committed crimes in his unsuccessful bid to retain power after losing the 2020 election. A recent court filing, unsealed following a Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity, contends that Trump is not immune from prosecution.

Special counsel Jack Smith’s team submitted the 165-page document, likely the final detailed case before the November 5 election. Trump faces four criminal charges, including conspiracy to obstruct the certification of the election and interference with voter rights.

Prosecutors aim to demonstrate that their remaining allegations against Trump can withstand the Supreme Court’s broad immunity ruling for former presidents. New evidence, including witness interviews and grand jury testimonies, will be disclosed during the trial.

Senior Trump administration officials, such as former Vice President Mike Pence and White House Chief-of-Staff Mark Meadows, testified before the grand jury. Trump’s lawyers opposed the filing, arguing that it is inappropriate so close to the election.

The presidential race is tight, with Vice President Kamala Harris leading in national polls. Swing states show more complex, tight races. If Trump wins, he may direct the Justice Department to drop the charges.

### Harvard Students Demonstrate Facial Recognition Risks with Ray-Ban Meta Glasses

Two Harvard students, AnhPhu Nguyen and Caine Ardayfio, have demonstrated a chilling capability: using Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses to perform real-time facial recognition, pulling up personal details like names, addresses, and phone numbers of strangers. Their project, I-XRAY, combines Meta's smart glasses with PimEyes' facial recognition software. PimEyes, a public facial recognition search engine, scans the web for images matching a face, providing a gateway to personal data.

The students chose Meta's glasses for their inconspicuous design and affordability, highlighting the ease with which such technology can be misused. Meta acknowledged that any camera-equipped device could be adapted for this purpose, not just their glasses.

To protect yourself, Nguyen and Ardayfio suggest contacting data brokers like PimEyes and FastPeopleSearch to remove your information. PimEyes offers an opt-out page for image removal, and FastPeopleSearch provides forms for data deletion.

This project underscores the potential for abuse in today's tech landscape, even when intentions are noble. It serves as a stark reminder of the importance of privacy measures in an increasingly digital world.

### US dockworkers' strike triggers global supply chain crisis.

45,000 dockworkers in the United States went on strike, causing 36 ports to shut down. This is the first time in 50 years, with far-reaching implications. Daily economic losses are as high as $5 billion. Global supply chains are disrupted, inflationary pressures are intensifying, and the path for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates is clouded. Foreign clients may turn to other suppliers, and commodity prices could rise. The strike has paused, but the crisis remains unresolved.

**Explanation:**
- **Dockworkers**: Workers at ports responsible for loading and unloading cargo.
- **Supply chain**: The entire process from production to consumption of goods.
- **Federal Reserve**: The central bank of the United States, responsible for monetary policy.

  alt="Antarctic Plant Growth Surges Amid Climate Change"

Antarctic plant cover has surged more than tenfold since 1986. Satellite data reveals a jump from less than one square kilometer to nearly 12 square kilometers by 2021. The growth, mostly mosses, accelerated post-2016. This greening signals global heating's impact on the Antarctic, which warms faster than the global average.

Dr. Thomas Roland, University of Exeter, notes the Antarctic remains largely ice and rock, but the plant fraction has grown dramatically. He warns future heating could alter the region's biology and landscape. The study, published in Nature Geoscience, uses Landsat images.

Prof. Andrew Shepherd, Northumbria University, corroborates the findings. He recalls visiting Larsen Inlet, where a beach, once buried under ice, now hosts a river with green algae. He calls it a "barometer of climate change."

The moss spread's acceleration from 2016 coincides with reduced sea ice around Antarctica. Warmer, wetter conditions favor plant growth. Mosses can colonize bare rock, fostering soil formation and potentially inviting invasive species.

Dr. Olly Bartlett, University of Hertfordshire, highlights the risk of non-native species arriving via visitors. Previous studies show increased moss growth rates and the spread of Antarctica's two native flowering plants. Green algae also blooms on melting snow.

This greening underscores the Antarctic's vulnerability to climate change. It mirrors the Arctic's greening and Greenland's rain, not snow, on its ice cap. The planet's poles, once thought immune, now show clear signs of human impact.

TSMC, Taiwan's leading chipmaker, and Amkor, a major packaging and testing service provider, have inked a deal to bring advanced chip packaging to the U.S. for the first time. This collaboration, set to take place in Arizona, marks a significant step in America's push to localize critical semiconductor supply chain technologies.

The partnership will see TSMC leveraging Amkor's planned $2 billion facility in Peoria for turnkey advanced packaging and testing services. This move aims to support TSMC's clients, particularly those utilizing its Phoenix-based wafer fabrication plants. Key clients include Nvidia, AMD, and Apple.

Advanced chip packaging is vital for enhancing chip performance and enabling powerful AI computing. Traditional methods of increasing transistor density are becoming more challenging, making this technology essential. The generative AI boom has further intensified demand.

Nvidia, for instance, relies on TSMC's CoWoS (Chip on Wafer on Substrate) technology to connect its high-performance graphics processors with high-bandwidth memories, boosting computing power. However, CoWoS constraints could hinder rapid AI data center deployment.

U.S. policymakers and industry leaders previously worried that even with domestic chip production, packaging and testing would still need to be outsourced to Asia. To counter this, the U.S. has allocated $1.6 billion to support advanced chip packaging development within its borders.

TSMC and Amkor will jointly refine specific packaging technologies, such as TSMC's Integrated Fan-Out (InFO) and CoWoS, to meet customer demands. InFO, used by Apple in its iPhone and Macbook chips, links memory chips with processors.

This collaboration promises to expand the U.S. semiconductor ecosystem, shorten product cycle times, and ensure more resilient supply chains. It's a strategic move that underscores the importance of localized high-tech manufacturing in an increasingly competitive global landscape.

The Middle East situation has suddenly escalated, with Iran launching missile attacks on Israel, sparking global concern over possible Israeli retaliation. President Biden stated that the U.S. is discussing whether to support Israel in striking Iran's oil facilities.

With Iran's daily production exceeding 3 million barrels, a disruption in supply could have a significant global impact. WTI crude oil futures surged over 5.69%, while Brent crude futures rose 4.98%, both hitting recent highs.

Analysts believe the oil price trend hinges on Israel's response. If Israel targets Iran's oil infrastructure, global supply could face a 4% risk. Bjarne Schieldrop, Chief Commodity Analyst at SEB, warned that destroying Iran's facilities could push oil prices above $200.

Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has taken a tough stance, vowing a strong response to Iran. Meanwhile, Iran's President has stated that they do not seek war but will respond strongly to further actions.

While Biden mentioned ongoing discussions, he does not expect Israel to retaliate immediately. Analysts point out that the market may be underestimating the tension in the Middle East, potentially leading to excessive bearishness.

The energy market appears too complacent, and short positions could be squeezed out. Analysts warn that the market needs to be vigilant of geopolitical risks, and any price rebound could be exacerbated by previous extreme bearishness.

In the long run, price increases may be limited, as OPEC members could restore supply in emergencies. The market should focus on Israel's response and whether Iran's oil industry sustains damage.

Billions of cells die daily in our bodies, each with its unique exit. Originally, scientists thought cells died only by accident (necrosis) or neatly (apoptosis). But now, over 20 distinct death modes exist.

**Necrosis**: Unplanned, messy death due to injury, infection, or disease.

**Apoptosis**: Neat, silent death, essential for development and tissue maintenance.

**Necroptosis and Pyroptosis**: Violent deaths signaling immune response. Necroptosis is a mix of apoptosis and necrosis; pyroptosis is a loud, inflammatory death.

**PANoptosis**: A hybrid death combining elements of apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis, crucial for immune response.

**NETosis**: Immune cells create DNA nets to trap pathogens, sometimes dying in the process.

**Cuproptosis and Ferroptosis**: Deaths triggered by copper or iron overload, potentially useful in cancer treatment.

**Entosis**: Cancer cells burrow into others, sometimes dying, other times surviving.

Understanding these death modes could lead to treatments for infections, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. Life and death are intertwined, each a part of the other.

Gilead Sciences plans to make cheaper versions of lenacapavir, an HIV prevention drug, available in 120 low- and middle-income countries. Lenacapavir, administered as a twice-yearly injection, has demonstrated strong efficacy in preventing HIV infection.

The drug effectively halted infection in trials involving girls and women in South Africa and Uganda, and provided nearly complete protection in trials conducted across Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Peru, South Africa, Thailand, and the US.

Gilead has come under pressure to make lenacapavir accessible globally at a reduced cost. It currently sells for $42,250 a year in the US under the brand name Sunleca. Researchers estimate it could be produced for as little as $40 per year per patient.

Gilead has entered into agreements with six manufacturers to produce generic lenacapavir for 120 "high-incidence, resource-limited" countries. The company will also supply Gilead-produced product until the manufacturers are operational, prioritizing 18 high-HIV-rate countries such as Botswana, South Africa, and Thailand.

Critics argue that the deal excludes many high-HIV-burden countries, particularly in Latin America. Dr. Mohga Kamal-Yanni of the People’s Medicines Alliance asserts that the agreements have "draconian conditions" that could impede access in excluded countries.

Winnie Byanyima, UNAids executive director, calls for lenacapavir access for all who would benefit. She warns that excluding upper middle-income countries, where 41% of new infections occur, undermines the drug's potential impact.

UNAids is still awaiting specific pricing details and full transparency on Gilead’s costs. The generic manufacturers include India’s Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Emcure Pharmaceuticals, and Hetero Labs, US-based Viatris’ unit Mylan, Egypt’s Eva Pharma, and Pakistan-based Ferozsons Laboratories.

Miami Dolphins, valued at $7.1 billion, are in talks to sell a minority stake to Ares Management and billionaire Joe Tsai. The deal, including Hard Rock Stadium and event rights, is estimated at $8.1 billion. A controlling stake would exceed $10 billion.

Ares, managing $450 billion, aims for a 10% share, while Tsai, owner of the Brooklyn Nets, seeks 3%. This marks the NFL's first private equity investment since new finance rules in August.

Stephen Ross, Dolphins' owner since 2009, plans to reinvest proceeds in South Florida real estate and sports. Ross, also CEO of Related Companies, benefits from stadium revenue, hosting events like the Miami Grand Prix and Miami Open.

The NFL, traditionally resistant to private equity, softened its stance due to rising valuations. Tsai, with a growing sports portfolio, adds to his empire with this potential acquisition.
