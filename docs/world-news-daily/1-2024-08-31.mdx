# World News Daily(2024-08-31) : Brazil's Supreme Court Suspends Elon Musk's X Nationwide

## Brazil's Supreme Court Suspends Elon Musk's X Nationwide

Brazil's top court ordered a nationwide suspension of Elon Musk's social network X. The suspension follows X's refusal to comply with court orders regarding content moderation and the appointment of a legal representative in Brazil. Judge Alexandre de Moraes imposed daily fines on those using VPNs to access X during the ban.

The court initially ordered Apple and Google to stop offering X downloads and VPN apps, but later suspended this directive. X had no legal representative in Brazil, despite legal requirements for social media companies to handle government takedown notices.

Brazil's population of over 171 million active social media users could impact X's business. Musk's acquisition of Twitter in 2022 led to significant changes, including the reinstatement of banned accounts, prompting major advertisers to withdraw.

Musk criticized de Moraes, comparing him to a movie villain and accusing him of censorship. The court's history includes suspending other social media apps like WhatsApp and Telegram until they complied with regulations.

### California Passes AI Safety Bill with 'Kill Switch' Mandate

California's Senate and Assembly have passed SB-1047, an AI safety bill. It mandates a "kill switch" for large AI models, to halt them if they pose new safety threats with minimal human oversight. The bill now awaits Governor Newsom's signature by September 30.

Critics argue the bill targets speculative future risks rather than current issues like deep fakes or misinformation. Supporters, including AI pioneers Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio, see it as essential for consumer protection, likening AI regulation to pharmaceuticals and aerospace.

Stanford's Fei-Fei Li and a group of business leaders oppose the bill, fearing it could stifle open-source collaboration and academic research. They urge Newsom to veto it, labeling it "fundamentally flawed."

Newsom is cautious, concerned about over-regulation but mindful of AI industry leaders calling for help. His decision will shape California's approach to AI safety and innovation.

### Discovery of Earth's Ambipolar Field: A Breakthrough in Atmospheric Science

Scientists have detected Earth's ambipolar field, a weak electric field, for the first time. This field, theorized 60 years ago, exists in the ionosphere at an altitude of 250 kilometers. It balances charged particles, maintaining the cohesion of electrons and ions. This equilibrium expands the atmosphere, enabling some ions to escape into space, a phenomenon known as polar wind.

The field is extremely weak, measured at only 0.55 volts. However, it influences hydrogen ions 10.6 times more than gravity, propelling them into space at supersonic speeds. Oxygen ions, being heavier, are also affected, resulting in a 271 percent increase in the thickness of the ionosphere.

These findings, published in Nature, provide new insights into the dynamics of planetary atmospheres.

South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol aims to revamp the national pension system, which faces depletion by 2055 due to a plunging birth rate and an aging population. The pension fund is projected to start running deficits by 2041, exhausting its reserves by 2055.

Yoon proposes automatic stabilization mechanisms to adjust benefits based on inflation and contributor numbers. This approach mirrors systems in Japan and Finland. Currently, 22 million South Koreans contribute to the pension fund, with four contributors for every beneficiary. This ratio is expected to nearly equalize by 2050.

The plan includes raising basic pension payments and gradually increasing premiums, with slower hikes for younger contributors. However, with opposition parties dominating the National Assembly, reaching a consensus may prove challenging.

**Key Terms:**
- **Total fertility rate:** Average number of children born per woman.
- **Macroeconomic slide:** A mechanism to adjust pension benefits based on economic factors.
- **OECD:** Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, an international organization that provides data and analysis on economic and social issues.

## Technology

### NASA's Europa Clipper Mission to Explore Jupiter's Ocean Moon

NASA's Europa Clipper, the largest spacecraft ever built for a planetary mission, is set to launch in October. Its destination: Europa, a moon of Jupiter, 480 million miles away. Europa's icy surface hides an ocean, possibly twice the volume of Earth's seas.

The spacecraft, equipped with massive solar array wings, will extend over 110 feet in space. These panels are crucial; Jupiter's orbit receives only 3-4% of Earth's sunlight. Despite earlier concerns about radiation affecting the mission, recent tests confirm the spacecraft's transistors can handle the conditions.

Europa Clipper will orbit Jupiter, making nearly 50 flybys of Europa between 2031 and 2034. It carries a suite of instruments, including cameras and ground-penetrating radar, to study the moon's ice and potential subsurface water.

The mission aims to uncover whether Europa's ocean hosts conditions suitable for life. A follow-up mission, Europa Lander, could drill into the ice for deeper exploration.

Launch opportunities begin October 10, 2024. The spacecraft will reach Jupiter in 2030, promising unprecedented insights into this enigmatic moon.

### Google's AI Advances in Early Disease Detection Through Bioacoustics

Google's AI, HeAR, listens for sickness. It utilizes bioacoustics, merging biology with sound. This technology predicts diseases early, which is particularly useful in regions with inadequate healthcare.

HeAR is trained on 300 million audio clips—ranging from coughs, sniffles, sneezes, to breaths. The data is sourced from YouTube, using non-copyrighted material. One notable dataset comes from Zambian hospital patients screened for TB. HeAR excels in identifying coughs, potentially spotting TB early.

In collaboration with Salcit Technologies, an Indian AI healthcare startup, HeAR's capabilities are enhanced. Salcit's Swaasa app collects cough samples and diagnoses diseases with 94% accuracy, costing just $2.40—a cheaper alternative to traditional tests.

Challenges include background noise in samples, and HeAR is not yet ready for the market. Nonetheless, the concept of using AI for sound-based diagnosis holds promise.

Electroencephalography (EEG) technology, with a century-long history, originated from experiments by German psychiatrist Hans Berger. EEG collects brain waves through electrodes placed on the head to analyze brain activity. Today, EEG is used for diagnosing diseases, exploring consciousness, and even controlling external devices.

In the future, EEG may become a routine tool for sleep monitoring and enter the consumer market, such as being integrated into everyday caps connected to smartphones. Clinically, EEG could become a primary communication tool for patients with paralysis or consciousness disorders.

More forward-looking applications include reading thoughts, memories, and dreams, which, though distant, are not science fiction. Artificial intelligence will help extract more information from EEG data, converting thoughts into text.

However, the advancements in EEG also raise privacy issues. While brain data does not represent thoughts themselves, it can infer ideas and feelings. The use of such devices involves data sharing, presenting ethical and legal challenges.

Professor Pedro Valdes-Sosa is optimistic about the future of EEG, believing its low cost and portability make it potentially valuable in global health monitoring. The development of EEG is not just a technological advancement but also a profound exploration of human thoughts and privacy.
