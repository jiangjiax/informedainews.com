Paetongtarn Shinawatra, 37, daughter of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was elected Thailand's new prime minister on August 16, 2024. She secured 319 votes from the lower house, surpassing the required majority. 491 lawmakers participated, with 145 voting against and 27 abstaining. No opposition candidates were nominated.

Paetongtarn expressed gratitude to her predecessor, Srettha Thavisin, who was removed by the Constitutional Court for appointing an ex-convict to his cabinet. She emphasized her readiness to work hard for the Thai people and mentioned a potential review of existing policies.

The new prime minister declined to discuss cabinet details or policies until receiving official royal endorsement. This is a standard procedure in Thailand, requiring parliamentary submission and royal approval before any official statements.

Paetongtarn's election marks a significant shift in Thailand's political landscape, with a focus on continuity and adaptability in governance.

Sydney — Audrey Tang, Taiwan's ex-Digital Minister, champions "pre-bunking" as a shield against fake news. Pre-bunking means alerting the public to impending disinformation attacks, allowing them to brace and respond proactively.

Tang emphasizes the need for swift action: debunking falsehoods within an hour of their emergence. This rapid response ensures truth reaches the masses before misinformation takes root.

Taiwan's approach includes the CoFact project, a collaborative platform akin to Wikipedia, where citizens contribute verified facts to combat lies.

Cybersecurity threats loom large, especially for nations like Tuvalu and Palau, which face increased pressure from China. Tang advocates for a united front, involving governments, civil societies, and private sectors, to bolster defenses against cyberattacks.

Her tenure's challenge? Distinguishing between foreign manipulation and domestic misinformation. Tang's travels to 20 countries highlight global interest in Taiwan's model of maintaining internet freedom without compromising free speech.

Taiwan stands out, blending high press freedom with effective disinformation defense. Tang's insights underscore the importance of collective vigilance and rapid, transparent responses in the digital age.

### Biden Administration Cuts Medicare Drug Prices, Promises Billions in Savings

Biden's team has just reduced prices on 10 key drugs. Medicare now negotiates directly with drug manufacturers. This initiative, starting in 2026, aims to save $6 billion for Medicare and $1.5 billion for patients.

Here's the breakdown:
- Eliquis: $231 (previously $521)
- Jardiance: $197 (previously $573)
- Xarelto: $197 (previously $517)
- Januvia: $113 (previously $527)
- Farxiga: $178.50 (previously $556)
- Entresto: $295 (previously $628)
- Enbrel: $2,355 (previously $7,106)
- Imbruvica: $9,319 (previously $14,934)
- Stelara: $4,695 (previously $13,836)
- Fiasp and NovoLog: $119 (previously $495)

These price cuts are significant. They could lead to healthier, longer lives for many. The Inflation Reduction Act, which enabled these negotiations, marks a first in Medicare's history.

The actual impact? It's difficult to pinpoint exactly. Drug prices are often obscured by confidential rebates. However, these new rates establish a benchmark. More negotiations are forthcoming.

This move is not just about saving money. It's about ensuring access. It's about making sure older Americans can afford the medications they need.

### Russian Oligarch's $93 Million Insider Trading Scandal

Vladislav Klyushin, a Russian oligarch, orchestrated a $93 million fraud through his company, M-13. The scheme involved hacking into American corporate earnings reports before they were made public. Klyushin and his team then traded stocks based on this insider information, reaping substantial profits.

M-13 targeted companies such as Tesla, Snapchat, and Roku. They stole Tesla's earnings report before its release, purchased stock, and profited when the stock price surged. The FBI eventually uncovered the operation and charged Klyushin and his associates with hacking and insider trading.

In 2023, Klyushin was sentenced to nine years in an American prison. He was released in 2024 as part of a U.S.-Russia prisoner swap, which also included Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich.

CNBC's Eamon Javers investigated this case, revealing how Russian hackers targeted U.S. investors. His documentary, "Putin's Trader," and accompanying podcast, "The Crimes of Putin's Trader," highlight the ongoing threat to American capital markets.

This case underscores a broader conflict between Russia and the West, with financial markets serving as a battleground. The integrity of American capital markets is at stake.

AI-generated Elon Musk images flood fake ads, bilking billions. Deepfake tech replicates voices, alters videos seamlessly. Pornographers, meme-makers, and scammers embrace this trend.

An 82-year-old, duped by a Musk-endorsed investment video, lost $690,000. Fraudsters tweaked a real interview, swapping Musk's voice with an AI clone. The altered video, costing mere dollars, spreads via social media ads.

Sensity, monitoring Deepfake videos, labels this the largest such scam. Fake Musk clips, mimicking his cadence and accent, dominate crypto ads. They often start with real footage, then sync lips and clone voices.

These ads, featuring news logos, deceive many. Musk tops Deepfake subjects, especially in crypto schemes. Victims invest small sums, then larger, as fake profits mount.

Musk, silent on this, remains a favorite for scammers. Authorities warn of rising AI cybercrimes. Criminals wield AI to enhance stealth and impact.

### Health Stocks Surge Amid Mpox Global Health Emergency

Health stocks surged as the World Health Organization declared mpox a global health emergency. Danish vaccine maker Bavarian Nordic saw its shares jump by as much as 17%. The company, with an approved mpox vaccine, could meet growing demand for shots.

U.S. pharmaceutical company Emergent Biosolutions also benefited, with its ACAM2000 vaccine recommended by the CDC. Medical tools supplier Precision System Science Co. soared 40% in Tokyo.

The WHO's declaration follows an mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, spreading to neighboring countries. Mpox, a zoonotic disease, spreads from animals to humans, causing flu-like symptoms and lesions. A new variant, clade Ib, appears more contagious.

Cases surged in 2022, prompting a WHO emergency declaration, later lifted in May 2023. The new outbreak is concerning, especially among children. Vaccine access remains a challenge. The WHO is working to increase access, releasing $1.45 million and expecting an initial $15 million requirement.

Bavarian Nordic CEO Paul Chaplin stated the company could ramp up vaccine supply to 2 million doses by year-end and 10 million by 2025 if orders are placed promptly.

### NIST Finalizes Post-Quantum Encryption Standards

NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, has finalized three post-quantum encryption standards. These standards aim to safeguard data against future quantum computer attacks.

The standards include:
- ML-KEM for general encryption.
- ML-DSA and SLH-DSA for digital signatures.

A fourth algorithm, FN-DSA, is expected later this year. NIST is also evaluating additional backup algorithms, based on different mathematical principles.

Dustin Moody, a NIST mathematician, urges immediate adoption of the new standards. Full integration takes time, and preparation against potential attacks is crucial.

### Breaking's Olympic Debut: Expansion and Controversy

Breaking, born in the Bronx, made its Olympic debut in Paris. Phil (Wizard) Kim from Vancouver won gold, sparking global interest. Australian dancer Raygun faced ridicule online, but many see her inclusion as crucial for expanding the sport's reach.

Breaking isn't just about competition; it's about spreading the dance worldwide. Antonio Castillo, a breaker and founder of All 10 Breaking dance school, views the Olympic debut as historic. He emphasizes the dedication shown by competitors like Kim, who performed injured.

Geoff Reyes, president of Breaking Canada, believes the Olympics offer a broader audience but sees potential for breaking to develop its own professional leagues, akin to FIFA or the NBA.

Criticism of Raygun's performance highlights a misunderstanding of breaking's roots in Black and Latino communities. Cheryl Thompson, a researcher of Black performance art, argues that breaking was originally a community-building tool, not just a competitive sport.

The debate over breaking's Olympic inclusion reflects broader questions about the commercialization of hip-hop and the authenticity of its cultural expressions.

### WHO Re-declares Mpox a Global Health Emergency Amid Surge in Africa

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox a global health emergency for the second time. The virus, which causes painful lesions and can lead to severe illness or death, has surged again in Africa. This year, over 15,000 cases and nearly 500 deaths have been reported, marking a 160% increase from 2023.

Mpox spread rapidly worldwide in 2022, primarily through sexual networks and mainly affecting men who have sex with men. Vaccination efforts have reduced global case counts. However, a more transmissible form has emerged in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), spreading to neighboring countries like Rwanda and Uganda.

The Africa CDC estimates that 10 million vaccine doses are needed, but only 200,000 have been procured. The WHO is pushing for emergency use listing to accelerate vaccine access in lower-income countries.

Canada and the U.S. have pledged vaccine donations, but access remains limited in many parts of Africa. Without a coordinated international response, the virus could spread beyond Africa, threatening global health.

A new strain, clade Ib, is causing more severe disease and could pose a broader risk if it spreads globally. Early research suggests it may transmit through close household contact, affecting vulnerable populations like infants and children.

### Gender Differences in Muscle Metabolism: Implications for Exercise and Nutrition

Females and males process sugar and fatty acids differently in their muscles, according to a study. This distinction affects how their bodies utilize energy during exercise.

Female muscles excel at burning fat, whereas male muscles are more efficient at consuming sugar. These disparities arise from differences in muscle fiber types and metabolic pathways.

Grasping these differences could aid in customizing exercise regimens and nutritional guidance for improved health results. For example, females may derive greater benefits from endurance training, while males might achieve more significant improvements from high-intensity exercises.

This research highlights the significance of accounting for gender in sports science and medical interventions. It serves as a reminder that strategies effective for one gender may not yield the same benefits for the other.

Gimcheon Sangmu, a South Korean soccer team composed of military conscripts, is vying for the top spot in the K League. This marks a first for a military team in Asia’s oldest professional league.

Operated by the Korea Armed Forces Athletic Corps, Sangmu’s players serve 18 months of mandatory military duty, then return to their original clubs. Their current success is attributed to younger, talented players eager to complete their service early and a new coach, Chung Jung-yong, known for his work with young athletes.

Sangmu’s rise is also due to the struggles of traditional powerhouse clubs, which rely heavily on corporate funding. Economic uncertainties have forced these clubs to cut spending, opening the door for less traditional contenders.

Despite challenges like low attendance and limited local support, Sangmu remains competitive. With 12 games left, capturing the domestic title is a real possibility. The team’s resilience and unity under Coach Chung make them a formidable opponent.
