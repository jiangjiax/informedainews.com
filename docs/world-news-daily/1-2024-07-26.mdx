Leaked documents reveal UAE involvement in Sudan's civil war. Passports found on Sudanese battlefields link Emirati nationals to the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group. The UAE denies these claims.

The documents, sent to the UN, include images of Emirati passports found in Omdurman, a city recently reclaimed by the Sudanese army. Analysts call this evidence a "smoking gun," challenging UAE denials and raising questions about Western knowledge of Gulf state involvement.

The UAE is also accused of supplying RSF with drones equipped to drop thermobaric bombs, more devastating than conventional explosives. These bombs were recovered from Sudan's state broadcast headquarters in Omdurman.

This evidence forces a reevaluation of the conflict. Without UAE involvement, some experts believe the crisis might have ended sooner. The discovery of passports and bombs complicates the geopolitical landscape, challenging denials and demanding action.

### Genetically Modified Flies to Combat Waste and Reduce Methane Emissions

Australian scientists are modifying the genetics of black soldier flies to consume more waste. These flies already feed on organic refuse, converting it into products we use: lubricants, biofuels, and animal feed. The objective? To reduce methane emissions from landfills.

Dr. Kate Tepper and Dr. Maciej Maselko, from Sydney's Macquarie University, are leading the project. They view insects as the next major solution to our waste crisis, which is substantial—approximately a billion tons of food waste annually.

The flies are ubiquitous except in Antarctica. Their larvae consume voraciously—doubling their weight daily. They decompose waste more rapidly than microbes. The team's spin-off, EntoZyme, aims to commercialize this technology by the end of the year.

Plans for the future include developing flies capable of processing contaminated waste, leaving behind fertilizer. They could also produce enzymes for various applications and fatty compounds for biofuels and lubricants.

The research, published in Communications Biology, indicates that engineered flies could neutralize pollutants, making waste safer and more valuable.

### Revolut Secures Long-Awaited UK Banking License

Revolut, a fintech company with 45 million users, has just secured a UK banking license, a pursuit that began in 2021. The significance of this achievement is underscored by the fact that Revolut has 9 million clients in the UK. They have been operating in the EU since 2018, thanks to a partnership with Lithuania.

Prior to obtaining the UK license, Revolut was unable to offer credit products such as loans or cards, and had a less robust control over its local operations. Nik Storonsky, co-founder and CEO, is enthusiastic about the development. "Revolut will become the bank of choice for UK customers," he declares.

The implementation of these changes will not be immediate. The banking license comes with conditions—a "mobilisation" phase is required. For up to a year, Revolut will be restricted from holding more than £50,000 in customer deposits. This phase was also experienced by Monzo and Starling.

Revolut Group Holdings Ltd's subsidiary has been approved, but UK customers will continue to operate under the Financial Conduct Authority's e-money regulations for the time being.

In 2023, Revolut reported $2.2 billion in revenue and $545 million in pre-tax profit. This marks the first time in three years that they met the annual report deadline. Increased transparency may have contributed to the favorable outcome with the Prudential Regulation Authority.

Chef Robotics, a startup in San Francisco, has developed an AI-powered robotic arm system that can be programmed with recipes to accurately measure ingredients and sauces. Following successful trials with brands like Amy's Kitchen, the company is expanding its deployment.

Previously, robots struggled with the variability in food processing, where human hands were more adaptable, especially in tasks like rice or cheese shredding. However, advancements in AI have enhanced robot capabilities, enabling them to distinguish between tasks such as scooping peas and cauliflower, thereby improving their accuracy over time.

Chef Robotics does not sell its robots outright; instead, they offer a service model where clients pay an annual fee for system maintenance and training. Amy's Kitchen utilizes eight systems, each equipped with dual arms, across two factories. These robots can replace two to four human workers, depending on the task, and also reduce waste by dispensing ingredients more precisely than humans.

The CEO of Chef Robotics, Rajat Bhageria, estimates the annual cost of a single-arm system at under $135,000. This investment is justified by the efficiency and cost savings in labor and materials.

Lerrel Pinto, from NYU's Robotics and AI lab, notes that more versatile robots are likely to be adopted across new industries, highlighting the shift towards more general-purpose robots driven by advancements in deep learning.

For Amy's Kitchen, the challenge now is to ensure that robot-packed foods maintain the aesthetic of hand-packed items. They are continuously training the robots to handle a wider variety of foods, aiming to increase their role in packaging frozen meals.
