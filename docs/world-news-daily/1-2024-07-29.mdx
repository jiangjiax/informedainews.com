Research from Tulane University reveals that the anticancer drug BLZ945 can significantly reduce HIV levels in the brain. This drug targets infected cells, providing a new strategy for clearing viral reservoirs. The study was published in the journal "Brain," marking an important advancement in the fight against HIV.

Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) is effective, it cannot eradicate the virus and requires lifelong treatment. The virus hides in "viral reservoirs" such as the brain, where the blood-brain barrier hinders treatment. Long-term infection of brain macrophages leads to neurocognitive disorders.

The research focuses on macrophages, using the small molecule inhibitor BLZ945 to block receptors and reduce viral load. High-dose treatment reduced viral DNA by 95-99%, without affecting microglial cells or showing signs of liver toxicity.

Next, the study will test the combination of BLZ945 with ART to evaluate its efficacy, paving the way for a comprehensive eradication of HIV.

Researchers from Ritsumeikan University have discovered a new method to completely decompose perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFAS) using visible light at room temperature, a harmful chemical substance commonly known as the "forever chemical." This method decomposes PFAS into fluoride ions within 8 hours, enabling sustainable recovery of fluorine.

PFAS, due to its stability, is widely used in products such as cookware, clothing, and firefighting foams, but this stability makes it difficult to decompose in the environment, posing threats to health and the environment. Traditionally, PFAS requires temperatures above 400°C to decompose, making its treatment challenging.

The new method utilizes visible LED light to irradiate semiconductor nanocrystals, efficiently decomposing PFAS into fluoride ions through a mechanism involving photoinduced ligand displacement and Auger-induced electron injection. This method is conducted at room temperature, simplifying the treatment process.

The study was published in "Angewandte Chemie International Edition," and Professor Yoichi Kobayashi, the lead author, believes that this method has the potential to effectively decompose various PFAS under mild conditions, contributing to a sustainable fluorine recovery society.

By recovering fluorine from discarded PFAS, the reliance on fluorine production can be reduced, establishing a more sustainable recycling process. This technology will promote the development of fluorine recovery techniques, which are crucial in multiple industries.

  alt="EU Olive Oil Fraud Reaches Record High Amid Rising Prices"

Olive oil fraud has reached a record high in the EU, with prices doubling since 2018 due to climate crisis-induced extreme weather and other factors. This surge has fueled a hidden market for fraud and mislabeling.

In the first quarter of 2023, 50 cases of potential fraud and mislabeling were recorded, a threefold increase from 2018. These cases include oils contaminated with unauthorized substances such as pesticides and mineral oils, as well as glass fragments.

Extra virgin olive oil, a premium unrefined oil, was often adulterated with cheaper oils or mislabeled. For example, lampante oil, which is unfit for direct consumption, was sold as extra virgin.

Italy, Spain, and Greece top the list of reported fraud cases. The EU introduced new rules in 2022 to combat this, focusing on conformity checks and analytical methods.

Despite the increase in reported cases, the EU claims this reflects better vigilance and cooperation among member states, not an exacerbated risk.

Professor Chris Elliott notes that contaminated olive oil is unlikely to appear in big supermarkets, but small businesses and food services are more vulnerable.

Climate-driven inflation often leads to increased fraud in commodities like olive oil, chocolate, and coffee. The more processed a food, the higher the risk of fraud.

Italian authorities seized 380 tonnes of fraudulent oil products last year, worth over €2 million, and reported 17 individuals to judicial authorities for serious violations.
