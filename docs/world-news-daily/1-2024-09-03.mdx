Dominique P, 71, faces trial in Avignon for drugging his wife and orchestrating her rape by over 80 strangers for nearly a decade. Fifty men, including professionals like a journalist and a firefighter, are co-accused.

P allegedly crushed sleeping pills and anti-anxiety meds into his wife’s food or wine. He recruited men from an online chatroom obsessed with non-consensual sex. Instructions were clear: no scents, no smoke, leave if she moved.

Arrested in 2020 after filming women in a supermarket, police found a USB drive labeled “abuses” with 20,000 images and videos of the assaults. P confessed to drugging, offering, and filming his wife.

The victim, drugged to near-coma, had no memory of the rapes. She believed she had an undiagnosed illness, with her husband blaming her symptoms on fatigue. Her children suspected Alzheimer’s.

P is also linked to a 1991 Paris murder of a 23-year-old woman, where DNA evidence matches his profile. The trial, expected to last four months, could sentence P and the co-defendants to 20 years in prison.

Brazil's supreme court banned X, Elon Musk’s social media platform, for ignoring local laws. The ban affects over 21 million users. Justices voted unanimously to keep X blocked.

Flávio Dino, a court member, said X’s refusal to name a legal representative in Brazil showed it thought itself above the law. Judge Cristiano Zanin noted X’s repeated disregard for court orders.

Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who initiated the ban, also prohibited using VPNs to access X, with fines of 50,000 reais per day for violations.

Musk has criticized the court and Brazil’s left-wing government, calling the ban an attack on free speech. His company, Starlink, reportedly refuses to enforce the ban.

The conflict centers on whether foreign companies must follow Brazilian laws. Experts predict the dispute will escalate before resolution.

Ukrainian forces recently initiated a large-scale cross-border offensive in the Kursk region, marking one of the most significant operations since the conflict began in 2022. A senior Ukrainian security official stated that the operation aims to "stretch" and "disrupt" Russian defenses, with Ukrainian troops successfully breaching Russian lines. While the progress in Kursk has boosted morale, fighting continues along the eastern front, and Russian forces have not significantly withdrawn their troops. Ukrainian officials have made it clear that they do not intend to annex Russian territory but seek to influence public sentiment within Russia and create leverage for future negotiations. Additionally, Ukraine claims to have detained nearly 600 Russian soldiers as bargaining chips for the exchange of imprisoned Ukrainians. Despite the ongoing tensions, Ukraine's actions are seen as a significant blow to Russia, enhancing domestic morale and attracting international attention.

Pope Francis, 87, embarked on his longest tour, spanning Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, East Timor, and Singapore. The 12-day, 32,000km journey marks a significant milestone in his 11-year papacy.

In Jakarta, Francis will engage with leaders of Indonesia's six recognized religions at Istiqlal mosque, emphasizing interfaith dialogue and addressing issues like violence and environmental degradation.

Security is robust, with over 4,000 law enforcement officers ensuring safety. The visit underscores Indonesia's commitment to religious diversity and harmony.

This tour, originally planned for 2020 but delayed due to COVID-19, highlights Francis's ongoing efforts in Islamic-Christian dialogue, extending his message from previous visits to Muslim-majority nations.

Despite health challenges, including recent hernia surgery and respiratory issues, Francis remains determined, traveling with medical support. His visit aims to reinforce global religious cooperation and address pressing humanitarian and environmental concerns.

Deepfakes, manipulated media using AI, have surged in Japan. Cases jumped 28 times last year. Scams rose 243% in the first quarter.

Japan, once shielded by its complex language, now faces a flood of fraud. Generative AI crafts convincing Japanese media, breaking down the language barrier.

Financial scams, often international, exploit AI's ability to mimic native fluency. A UK firm lost $25.6 million to a deepfake video call.

Japan's National Institute of Informatics fights back with detection tools. A new program spots deepfake audio, crucial for preventing voice scams.

The threat is real. As AI sophistication grows, so does the risk. Protective measures are essential. The battle against deepfakes is on.

### Couche-Tard Considers Acquisition of 7-Eleven

Couche-Tard is eyeing 7-Eleven for its inexpensive stock. Portfolio manager Richard Kaye believes there's limited scope for enhancement in 7-Eleven's core operations. The interest arises as 7-Eleven embarks on a global expansion strategy and disposes of underperforming supermarkets.

Kaye is skeptical that a foreign acquisition would lead to significant transformation. 7-Eleven is outstanding in logistics and innovation. He identifies potential in revamping other areas, but these do not impact profitability.

Seven & i's stock is trading at a low price-to-earnings ratio of 27.96 and a price-to-book ratio of 1.47. Despite having fewer stores, Couche-Tard boasts a higher market valuation of $54 billion compared to 7-Eleven's $38.3 billion.

Regulatory challenges are on the horizon, particularly in the U.S. Analysts anticipate divestments to alleviate antitrust issues.

Kaye considers 7-Eleven a compelling buying opportunity. It is more affordable than its global counterparts yet performs admirably.

"Happy Fishing Master," a simple mobile fishing game, unexpectedly gained popularity this year. The core gameplay is straightforward: casting and reeling. This minimalist design surprisingly attracted a large number of players and even became a hit overseas, topping the free charts in the United States and Japan.

Part of the game's success can be attributed to its precise grasp of the sense of satisfaction. Compared to the established fishing game "Fishing Clash," "Happy Fishing Master" features more detailed fish modeling and optimized game details, such as the instantly gratifying card pack design, as well as the added left-right rod swinging and hooking mechanisms, enhancing the player's immersion.

The development company behind it, Beijing Tuyoo, has always been low-profile yet highly profitable. Starting with card and board games, Tuyoo has recently attempted to expand its game types but ultimately found that simple and direct gameplay is the most appealing to players. The success of "Happy Fishing Master" demonstrates the strong appeal of simple games in the casual gaming sector.

Tuyoo's success also reminds us that game design does not need to be complex; simple and direct gameplay often resonates more with players. This simple yet repetitive action of casting and reeling is akin to eating sunflower seeds, making it hard to stop.

Disney aims to reclaim Japan's movie market. Carol Choi, Disney's Asia-Pacific content chief, notes Japan's swift recovery from COVID-19's impact on cinema. In 2023, Japan's box office rose 4% to 221.4 billion yen, with domestic anime dominating.

Historically, foreign films led Japan's box office. Now, Disney plans sequels like "Inside Out 2" and "Mufasa: The Lion King" to attract viewers. Choi emphasizes Disney's legacy and fan loyalty as key advantages.

Disney+ will feature more Japanese content, including anime adaptations and live-action series. Collaboration with Oriental Land, operator of Tokyo DisneySea, enhances Disney's presence in Japan.

Disney's strategy includes leveraging theme parks and cruises, tapping local talent, and expanding Asian content on Disney+. Choi highlights the global appeal of Japanese-themed content, evident in FX's "Shogun" Emmy nominations.

Frieze Seoul, an extension of the esteemed Frieze fairs in London, New York, and Los Angeles, makes its return to Seoul for its third edition.

The South Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism supports these efforts, aiming to cement the nation's position as a pivotal art hub.

The art market in South Korea has experienced substantial expansion, partly attributed to advantageous tax regulations. Major corporations like Samsung and LG have been significant art investors for years, nurturing a thriving collecting culture.

### Semaglutide Shows Reduced Covid-19 Death Risk in Studies

People on semaglutide, a key component of Ozempic and Wegovy, had a 33% lower risk of dying from Covid-19, according to studies in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. Semaglutide, manufactured by Novo Nordisk, also demonstrated benefits for heart and kidney health, and reduced deaths from non-heart causes by 29%.

The drug appears to enhance overall health, with weight loss almost as a side effect. Benjamin Scirica, a study co-author, noted that weight was not a major factor in these benefits. The research involved over 17,600 overweight or obese individuals with heart issues, but not diabetes.

Novo Nordisk, now Europe's most valuable company, faces competition from Eli Lilly and others in the weight loss market. Yale's Harlan Krumholz suggests that semaglutide might work through multiple health-promoting mechanisms, but more research is needed.

Not all news is positive: Harvard found that weight loss drugs might increase the risk of a rare eye disease.

CCTV journalists conducted an undercover investigation into Beijing's food delivery restaurants, revealing the stark contrast between their online glamour and offline filth. Restaurants with high ratings and sales volumes are, in fact, unsanitary home-based workshops. Delivery riders expose the truth about the kitchens, making ordering food delivery akin to a live-action murder mystery game.

"Pinduoduo for Meals" attracts customers with low prices, but the ingredients are substandard, and service is compromised. Riders refuse to deliver to upper floors due to low delivery fees, and merchants treat bundled products differently. Consumers are caught in the middle, becoming the ultimate victims.

Riders have become the "whistleblowers" in the food delivery industry, exposing unscrupulous businesses and guiding customers to clean restaurants. Although algorithms control riders, merchants, and customers, human nature and trust will ultimately transcend algorithms.

The food delivery issues expose the food safety risks under consumption downgrade. Behind the low prices lies the sacrifice of quality and service. The righteous actions of riders remind us to pay attention to food sources and support ethical businesses.

### Record Rainfall Threatens China's Food Security

Torrential rains have struck northern Chinese farms, damaging crops and causing vegetable prices to skyrocket. Farmers accustomed to drought have been confronted with fields transformed into mud. Across the nation, prices for staples such as eggplant and cucumbers have surged by up to 40%.

China's leaders, including Xi Jinping, are on high alert, aiming to reduce agricultural losses and ensure food security for the country's 1.4 billion people. Premier Li Qiang inspected flood-control projects and urged local officials to take action.

Climate change exacerbates the challenge. As the world's largest food importer, China must feed nearly one-sixth of the global population with less than one-tenth of the world's arable land. Extreme weather events are occurring more frequently.

The government has invested in dams and warning systems, but must adapt more quickly to unpredictable weather. Food security is a top priority, considering historical famines that sparked unrest.

In the short term, high food prices strain consumer spending power in an already sluggish economy. In the long term, ensuring stable food supplies remains crucial. Xi Jinping has stressed the need to revitalize rural areas and reduce food waste.

China's water distribution has historically been uneven, with the south prone to floods and the north to drought. The government has concentrated on flood control infrastructure in historically affected areas but must now expand its approach.
