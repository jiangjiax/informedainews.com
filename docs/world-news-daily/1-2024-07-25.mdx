New Zealand has released a comprehensive report on abuse in state and faith-based care. Over 200,000 victims, from 1950 to 1999, endured suffering. The report, weighing 14kg, took six years to compile.

Abuse was rampant—including sexual, physical, and emotional forms. Caregivers, religious leaders, social workers, and doctors were among the perpetrators. Children at Lake Alice Psychiatric hospital were subjected to torture in the 1970s.

Survivors often faced homelessness, poverty, addiction, and even worse outcomes. Māori survivors particularly lost touch with their cultural heritage. Some ended up joining gangs, incarcerated, or taking their own lives.

The report advocates for the establishment of a new agency, the Care Safe Agency, to prevent future abuses. It also demands formal apologies from leaders and churches.

This report marks a beginning, not an end. It calls for a complete overhaul of the care system. Survivors are hopeful for transformation, moving from darkness to light.

Switzerland has recently enacted a law mandating that all government offices must utilize open-source software. This implies that the source code for the software they employ is publicly accessible, enhancing transparency and security. Additionally, they are required to distribute any new software they develop, unless it is copyrighted or sharing it poses significant risks. This initiative reduces reliance on proprietary software companies and fosters greater collaboration. It marks a pioneering step for any nation and could potentially encourage other countries to follow suit.

Open-source software refers to software whose source code is available for free, allowing anyone to use, modify, or enhance it.

### Wealthy Nations Expand Oil and Gas Production Despite Climate Pledges

Wealthy nations, such as the US and UK, are ramping up oil and gas production, threatening to release nearly 12 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases by 2024. Despite their climate pledges, these countries are leading the charge in fossil fuel expansion.

The International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) analyzed industry data and found that new oil and gas field licenses could generate the highest emissions since 2018. These emissions, roughly equivalent to China's annual output, surpass the last four years combined.

Fossil fuel companies are investing more in new sites than ever since the 2015 Paris climate deal. Wealthy countries, despite their economic advantages and obligations under the Paris accords, are spearheading this drilling frenzy, issuing 825 new licenses in 2023, the most on record.

Countries like the UK, US, Canada, Norway, and Australia are now seen as "other petrostates." They have the resources to transition to cleaner energy but are instead investing heavily in fossil fuels.

The US, under the Biden administration, has issued 1,453 new licenses, accounting for half of the global total and 83% of wealthy nations' licenses. The UK is also handing out more licenses, despite pledges to stop new drilling.

The hypocrisy is stark. Rich countries with low economic dependence on fossil fuels should be leading the transition away from oil and gas. Instead, they continue to issue licenses and invest in new fields.

### Pfizer's Gene Therapy Shows Promise for Hemophilia A

Pfizer's new gene therapy for hemophilia A shows promise in a large trial. This rare disorder, affecting about 25 in 100,000 males, lacks a crucial blood-clotting protein. Without it, blood doesn't clot well, leading to frequent bleeding.

The therapy, a one-time treatment, significantly reduced bleeding episodes in patients. It outperformed the current method, which involves regular infusions of the missing protein.

If approved, Pfizer's treatment will compete with BioMarin's Roctavian, which costs $2.9 million and has had a slow uptake since its approval.

Hemophilia A patients currently rely on frequent IV infusions or injections to manage bleeding. The potential shift to a one-time gene therapy could revolutionize treatment, offering a cure rather than ongoing management.

Pfizer's success in this trial positions it at the forefront of gene therapy advancements, potentially changing how chronic conditions like hemophilia A are treated.

### Genetically Modified Flies Tackle Global Waste Problem

Australian scientists are modifying the genes of black soldier flies to consume more waste. These flies already feed on organic garbage, converting it into materials we use—such as lubricants and animal feed. The objective? To reduce methane emissions from landfills, a significant climate issue.

Dr. Kate Tepper and Dr. Maciej Maselko, from Sydney's Macquarie University, are leading the project. They view insects as the next major solution for our waste, which amounts to a staggering billion tons of food refuse annually. These flies, found worldwide except in Antarctica, can eat twice their body weight daily.

The team's spin-off, EntoZyme, aims to commercialize this technology, with plans to release genetically engineered flies by the end of the year. These flies could also produce enzymes for various industries and manage contaminated waste, transforming it into usable fertilizer.

In essence, these flies could serve as our new cleanup team, converting waste into valuable resources while aiding the planet.

  alt="New Antibiotic Combats Superbugs by Hitting Dual Targets"

Bacteria evolve resistance to antibiotics, posing a significant problem. Researchers from the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) have discovered a solution. They have developed a new antibiotic that simultaneously targets two key areas within bacteria, making it nearly impossible for them to develop resistance.

This novel drug, MCX-128, combines elements of two existing types of antibiotics: macrolides and fluoroquinolones. Macrolides inhibit protein synthesis in bacteria, while fluoroquinolones interfere with DNA synthesis. MCX-128 performs both functions by tightly binding to bacterial ribosomes, which are essential for protein production. This dual-target approach renders bacteria virtually defenseless.

Alexander Mankin, one of the researchers, explains, "Bacteria cannot mutate to resist both targets at the same time." Yury Polikanov further adds, "The same concentration of the drug hits two targets, making it difficult for bacteria to counter."

The research team estimates that MCX-128 makes it a billion times more difficult for bacteria to evolve resistance. This could represent a significant breakthrough in combating superbugs. The study has been published in Nature Chemical Biology.

Yakult, the probiotic drink manufacturer, aims for a 50% increase in sales in India. They have introduced a mango-flavored version exclusively for the country. Eiji Amano, Managing Director of Yakult Danone India, announced this at a recent event.

The company, a joint venture between Yakult Honsha and Groupe Danone, has been operating in India since 2008 and now serves 650 cities. Initially offering the original flavor, they launched "Yakult Light" in 2018 to address sugar concerns, which now accounts for 25% of their sales.

The new mango flavor, part of the light series, targets a 10-15% market share. Priced at 100 rupees for a pack of five, there are also discounts available for home delivery. Currently, around 300 Yakult ladies, who are delivery workers, serve Delhi, Mumbai, and Pune.

Amano highlighted customer-centric product development. The event was attended by Takashi Ariyoshi, Minister at the Japanese Embassy, and Bollywood actress Sanya Malhotra. Ariyoshi commended Yakult's unique distribution system and its community impact in Japan.
