More than 200 women have accused Mohamed Al Fayed of sexual assault, with several claims linked to his tenure at Fulham FC. Fayed owned the club from 1997 to 2013, investing £200m to elevate its status.

A BBC documentary sparked the recent wave of allegations, reporting that Fayed raped five Harrods employees. Justice for Harrods Survivors, a legal group, represents the accusers.

Fulham FC is investigating potential impacts on its staff. The Football Association is monitoring the situation.

Gaute Haugenes, who managed Fulham’s women’s team, said staff knew Fayed preferred young, blond women and took precautions to protect players.

Dr. Ann Coxon, a former Fayed employee, denied conducting sexual health tests on Harrods staff.

The Metropolitan Police is reviewing all existing allegations from 1979 to 2013. Though Fayed died in 2023, police aim to pursue any related criminal offenses.

Commander Stephen Clayman acknowledged the impact on victims and pledged a thorough investigation. The Met has received 19 complaints since 2005, including three rape allegations. Despite multiple approaches to the Crown Prosecution Service, no action was taken against Fayed.

Shigeru Ishiba, 67, is Japan's next prime minister, succeeding Fumio Kishida. A banker-turned-politician, Ishiba has spent 38 years in politics, focusing on security and rural revival. He was encouraged to enter politics by Kakuei Tanaka after his father, Jiro Ishiba, a former home affairs minister, passed away.

Ishiba has held key positions, including defense and agriculture minister. Despite his popularity among voters, he often clashed with LDP heavyweights. This is his fifth bid for the LDP presidency, which he won.

As a defense expert, Ishiba is concerned about Asia's security, particularly North Korea's missile launches. He advocates for a NATO-style collective security arrangement in Asia, emphasizing the U.S.-Japan alliance.

Economically, Ishiba aims to revitalize small cities like his hometown, Tottori, by rejuvenating rural industries. He supports renewable energy but seeks to reduce nuclear power's role.

Ishiba is also pushing for LDP reform, especially after recent political scandals. He advocates for transparency in political funding and the regulation of political party governance.

Outside politics, Ishiba is known for his love of trains and curry, which endears him to voters.

### Mayor Adams' Indictment: Favors and Undisclosed Benefits from Turkish Interests

  alt="Mayor Adams' Indictment: Favors and Undisclosed Benefits from Turkish Interests"
/>

Mayor Eric Adams' indictment reveals a web of favors and undisclosed benefits from Turkish interests. In 2021, Adams won the Democratic primary and planned a trip to Istanbul. His aide, Rana Abbasova, contacted Turkish Airlines' Cenk Öcal for tickets. Öcal offered a suspiciously low price of $50, prompting Abbasova to request a more realistic $1,000. Adams eventually paid $2,200 for business class tickets worth over $15,000.

Adams' election win in New York drew attention in Turkey. Arda Sayiner, a businessman, planned to leverage Adams' position for Turkish lobbying. Turkish Consul General Reyhan Özgür assured Abbasova that Adams' Turkish contacts were unnecessary, as the foreign minister was personally involved.

In 2022, Adams traveled to Ghana, with Turkish Airlines covering most of the $14,000 business-class ticket cost. A nine-hour layover in Istanbul included a BMW ride and a high-end meal, arranged by Özgür.

Adams also pressured the Fire Department to approve a Turkish Consulate tower with serious fire safety defects, to accommodate a visit by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Sayiner suggested raising illegal foreign donations for Adams' campaign. Abbasova initially doubted Adams' involvement but later found he agreed. The FBI later searched Abbasova's home, leading her to cooperate with prosecutors.

Adams maintained a policy of hiding communications, deleting messages to avoid scrutiny. He met with Abbasova and Sayiner to discuss collecting foreign donations, highlighting his entanglement with Turkish interests.

Hurricane Helene slammed into Florida as a Category 4 storm, packing winds of 225 kph. The storm surged from the Gulf, gathering strength over warm waters. Helene's storm surge could reach 20ft, making it deadly for coastal residents.

Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, Virginia, and Alabama declared states of emergency. Governor Ron DeSantis urged evacuation, warning of flooding and power outages. Tallahassee's mayor, John Dailey, called Helene the strongest storm to hit the city.

Climate change is driving more powerful hurricanes. Helene's strength was fueled by the Gulf's unusually warm waters. Only three Gulf hurricanes since 1988 were larger.

Before landfall, parts of Florida saw water levels rise 2ft above normal. Tampa and St. Petersburg experienced 5ft storm surges. Helene is expected to move up the southeast coast, affecting 50 million people.

In North Carolina, officials warned of heavy rain and flooding. Helene knocked out power in western Cuba, affecting 230,000 customers. It also flooded parts of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.

Helene is the eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season. NOAA predicts an above-average season due to record-warm ocean temperatures.

  alt="The central bank's policy of lowering the reserve requirement ratio and interest rates has been implemented to support stable economic growth."
/>

The central bank announced a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio and interest rates, lowering the deposit reserve ratio by 0.5 percentage points and the 7-day reverse repo rate by 0.2 percentage points.

The central bank stated it will continue to introduce incremental financial policies, strengthen departmental coordination, and promote sustained economic recovery.

**Explanation:**

The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong hit a new all-time high, with year-to-date gains surpassing the S&P 500.

### Alibaba and JD.com Collaborate on Payments and Logistics

  alt="Alibaba and JD.com Collaborate on Payments and Logistics"

Chinese online giants Alibaba and JD.com are dismantling their walled gardens. By late October, Alibaba’s Taobao and Tmall will integrate JD’s logistics, while JD will accept Alibaba’s Alipay. This move, driven by antitrust pressures and slowing user growth, marks a significant shift in their decades-long rivalry.

The integration aims to align with Beijing’s antitrust directives and could benefit both companies. Taobao and Tmall merchants might switch to JD’s premium logistics, currently a key draw for JD customers. However, JD’s logistics will face stiff competition from cheaper options like ZTO and YTO Express, which dominate the market.

Alibaba’s logistics arm, Cainiao, faces challenges too. Its domestic user base is stagnant, prompting an overseas push. The IPO cancellation earlier this year underscores these difficulties.

The deal could also help Alipay, under pressure from WeChat’s integration into Taobao and Tmall. Overall, the move reflects a broader trend of opening up China’s tech ecosystems, with potential benefits for merchants and consumers alike.

Meta also introduced Quest 3S, a more affordable version of its VR headset, Quest 3. Despite being a "youth edition," Quest 3S retains many of Quest 3's features, including the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor and hand tracking, at a lower price point.

Meta AI saw significant upgrades, with new voice capabilities and real-time translation features. The AI can now process both text and images, thanks to the new Llama 3.2 model, enhancing the functionality of Meta's hardware.

Overall, Meta's latest offerings mark a significant step towards integrating AI and AR into everyday devices, making futuristic tech more accessible and practical.

### Van Gogh's 'Les Canots Amarrés' Sells for $27.6m at Hong Kong Christie's Auction

Vincent van Gogh's "Les Canots Amarrés" sold for $27.6 million at Christie's Hong Kong on September 26, falling short of the $230 million minimum estimate. The auction, featuring 42 masterpieces, marked the reopening of Christie's Asia-Pacific headquarters in Hong Kong's Henderson skyscraper.

Van Gogh's work, created in 1887, broke regional records but underscored slowing demand amid China's economic slowdown. Christie's had hoped for up to $380 million, aiming to set a new Asian auction record for Western art.

Claude Monet's "Nympheas" fetched $200 million, at the low end of estimates. The evening sale totaled $1 billion, boosting market confidence according to Ada Tsui, head of the sale.

Christie's CEO Guillaume Cerutti and executives inaugurated the new headquarters on September 20. The auction house plans long-term investment, despite challenges from China's weak economy and property slump.

Francis Belin, Christie's Asia-Pacific president, remains confident in the region's market, noting a surge in new collectors. Rival auction houses like Sotheby's, Phillips, and Bonhams are also expanding in Hong Kong.

**Key Terms:**
- **Blue-chip art:** High-value, highly sought-after artworks.
- **Inelastic demand:** Demand that remains constant despite price changes.

### FDA Approves New Schizophrenia Treatment, Cobenfy, Offering Fresh Approach

The FDA has approved Bristol Myers Squibb's Cobenfy, the first new type of schizophrenia treatment in over 70 years. Schizophrenia disrupts thinking, feeling, and behavior, often leading to paranoia, delusions, and hallucinations. It typically strikes in late teens to early 30s, making daily life challenging.

Cobenfy, a twice-daily pill, is expected to be available by late October. It offers a fresh approach for the nearly 3 million U.S. adults with schizophrenia, only 1.6 million of whom are currently treated. Many stop existing medications within 18 months due to ineffectiveness or side effects.

Cobenfy's approval stems from Bristol Myers Squibb's $14 billion acquisition of Karuna Therapeutics. The drug could be a significant revenue booster, though its impact may take years to materialize.

The drug costs $1,850 per month or $22,500 annually before insurance. Most patients, especially those on Medicare or Medicaid, will likely pay little out-of-pocket. The company plans a program to aid affordability.

Existing schizophrenia drugs block dopamine receptors, often causing side effects like weight gain and involuntary movements. Cobenfy, however, activates muscarinic receptors to reduce dopamine activity without these side effects. It also includes trospium to mitigate gastrointestinal issues.

Physicians are enthusiastic about Cobenfy's potential to offer efficacy without side effects. However, its high price may limit its use to patients who have failed other treatments.
