# World News Daily(2024-10-20) : Biden Administration Forgives $175 Billion in Student Loans for 5 Million Borrowers

## Biden Administration Forgives $175 Billion in Student Loans for 5 Million Borrowers

Biden's administration has forgiven $175 billion in student loans for nearly 5 million borrowers. This latest round, $4.5 billion for 60,000 public service workers, fixes a loophole in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. PSLF, initiated in 2007, had only benefited 7,000 before Biden took action. The total forgiven debt under Biden exceeds any previous president's efforts. Additionally, the administration has streamlined relief for 572,000 disabled borrowers and 1.6 million defrauded by their colleges. A one-time recount of past payments ensures accurate relief eligibility.

In October, during the golden autumn season, Xi Jinping visited a strategic missile unit in the Jianghuai region, where he inspected the troops with a history of over 50 years. Under the guidance of Xi Jinping's thought on strengthening the military, the unit has accomplished numerous significant tasks.

Xi Jinping thoroughly examined the development of the unit and the training of its officers and soldiers, inspected the newly upgraded main combat weaponry, and encouraged the troops to train diligently to ensure mastery of their weapons. He emphasized the need to deepen political rectification, uphold the Party's absolute leadership over the military, and ensure that the troops are fully obedient to the Central Committee of the Party.

Xi Jinping called for intensified training and preparedness to enhance combat capabilities and safeguard national strategic security. He pointed out that it is necessary to adapt to the modern warfare form, strengthen training on new equipment, new skills, and new tactics, and systematically develop practical combat capabilities.

This inspection once again highlighted Xi Jinping's emphasis on the political construction and practical readiness of the military, reflecting a high level of attention to national security.

### U.S. debt interest payments hit a record high, intensifying fiscal deficit challenges.

  alt="U.S. debt interest payments hit a record high, intensifying fiscal deficit challenges."
/>

For the first time, U.S. interest payments on debt have exceeded defense spending, accounting for 18% of federal revenue and reaching a 28-year high. In fiscal year 2024, the federal government's budget deficit reached $1.833 trillion, with net interest payments on debt totaling $882 billion, equivalent to 3.06% of GDP.

The main drivers of the rising deficit include increased spending on Social Security and Medicare, massive expenditures during the pandemic, and the 2017 tax reform. High interest rates have exacerbated fiscal pressures, with the Federal Reserve maintaining interest rates at a two-decade high.

The substantial interest payments could crowd out private investment and hinder economic growth. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that for every dollar of deficit-financed spending, private investment decreases by 33 cents.

With the election looming, the budget deficit has become a challenge for presidential candidates. Economic policies of Harris and Trump could lead to rising prices and an expanded deficit. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget predicts that Harris's plan would increase debt by $3.5 trillion, while Trump's plan would increase it to $7.5 trillion.

A Federal Reserve rate cut could alleviate the debt problem, but it will take time. Over the next few years, as low-interest government bonds mature, repayment costs will rise. The aging population will also increase, leading to higher costs for Social Security and Medicare, and the budget deficit will remain substantial.

Investors are not currently overly concerned about the U.S. fiscal challenges, but the situation has changed. With rising interest rates, debt interest payments have significantly increased, and the era of "free lunch" is over.

  alt="China's Renewable Energy Integration Challenges"
/>

China's renewable energy boom, with wind and solar capacity reaching 1,206 gigawatts (GW) by August, far surpasses its 2030 targets. The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts a 2.7-fold global growth in renewable energy by 2030, with China leading at 60%.

However, integrating this energy into the grid presents challenges. China's energy resources are concentrated in the northwest, far from major population centers in the south and east. Ultra-high-voltage (UHV) transmission lines, capable of spanning thousands of kilometers, are crucial. Twelve UHV projects, with a combined capacity of 84.5 GW and a $37 billion investment, are planned for 2021-2025.

Despite UHV's potential, construction delays cause power wastage. The IEA projects 3,207 GW of renewable capacity by 2030, with solar accounting for 80%. The grid must be reliable and flexible, accommodating intermittent wind and solar power. Batteries are essential for balancing supply and demand.

China's reliance on coal, which cannot quickly ramp up or down, complicates this. Gas-fired units, common in the U.S. and Europe, respond faster. The IEA warns of increasing wind and solar power waste in the north and northeast due to grid limitations.

**Key Terms:**
- **Gigawatts (GW):** Units of power, equivalent to one billion watts.
- **Ultra-high-voltage (UHV):** Power lines designed for long-distance transmission at very high voltages.

## Technology

### MIT Engineers Develop Solar-Powered Desalination System

MIT engineers have developed a solar-powered desalination system that adapts to sunlight variations, producing up to 5,000 liters of water daily. Unlike traditional reverse osmosis systems, it requires no batteries or grid power. Tested in New Mexico, it efficiently desalinated brackish groundwater—a resource more common than fresh groundwater.

The system's success lies in its ability to harness over 94% of solar energy, making it a viable solution for communities with limited access to fresh water and grid power. Amos Winter, a professor at MIT, calls this a "massive grand challenge" that they've overcome.

The researchers aim to commercialize the technology, focusing on reliability and scalability. Funding came from the National Science Foundation, the Julia Burke Foundation, and industry partners like Veolia and Xylem Goulds.

This innovation could revolutionize water access in inland areas, providing a sustainable, low-cost solution to water scarcity.

### Bill Gates Advocates for Open Source Tools in Digital Public Infrastructure

Bill Gates advocates for digital public infrastructure (DPI)—systems such as digital IDs, payment networks, and data platforms—as transformative for nations. DPI can bypass traditional development, providing instant, secure services at lower costs. For example, mobile banking eliminates the need for expensive branch networks, and digital IDs provide legal identity to millions.

Critics worry that DPI could enable surveillance or exclude vulnerable groups. Gates counters that well-designed DPI enhances privacy and inclusion. In India, DPI has brought banking to millions and offers enrollment assistance for the disadvantaged.

Open-source tools like MOSIP and Mojaloop aid in building DPI, fostering local innovation and competition. These tools allow smaller companies to develop services without reinventing foundational systems.

Gates views DPI as essential for the Gates Foundation's goals: health, agriculture, and women's financial empowerment. The foundation will invest $200 million over five years to support DPI globally.

**Key Terms:**
- **Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI):** Systems that connect people, data, and money, such as digital IDs and payment networks.
- **Open-Source Tools:** Software with publicly accessible source code, enabling anyone to modify and share.

Gates envisions a digital future that benefits everyone, not just a select few.

### 23andMe's Uncertain Future and Genetic Data Security Concerns

23andMe, once a leader in DNA testing, now teeters on the brink. A data breach in 2023 exposed the genetic data of nearly 7 million users, leading to a $30 million lawsuit settlement. The company’s value has plummeted by over 99% since its 2021 peak, driven by dwindling interest in its test kits and subscription services.

CEO Anne Wojcicki initially considered selling the company but later opted to take it private, causing a mass resignation of board members. This uncertainty raises concerns about the fate of the genetic data of its 15 million customers.

Unlike healthcare providers, 23andMe isn’t bound by HIPAA, the federal law protecting health information. Instead, it relies on its own privacy policies, which can change at any time. The company’s data is a valuable asset, potentially sold in a merger or bankruptcy. Wojcicki has hinted at marketing this data to pharmaceutical companies, shifting focus from drug development.

Privacy advocates urge users to delete their accounts, though 23andMe retains some data even after deletion, such as genetic information for compliance purposes. Over 80% of users have consented to data sharing for research, which cannot be fully reversed.

In short, 23andMe’s future is shaky, and so is the security of its users’ genetic data.

British scientists are launching a study to uncover how air pollution triggers dementia. The research, funded by Race Against Dementia, aims to understand the exact mechanisms by which tiny polluting particles, known as PM2.5s, affect the brain.

PM2.5s are minuscule fragments less than 2.5 millionths of a metre in diameter, produced by car exhausts, factories, and other sources. These particles can penetrate deep into the body, including the brain, through the olfactory bulb.

The study, titled Rapid, will explore three potential mechanisms:
1. PM2.5s directly accelerate protein clumping, a hallmark of Alzheimer’s.
2. The particles interfere with the brain’s ability to clear clumping proteins.
3. PM2.5s trigger inflammation in brain immune cells, called microglia, leading to dementia.

The research will use human stem cells and animal models to identify which mechanism is at play. Understanding these processes could lead to new drugs that mitigate the impact of air pollution on brain diseases.

Bangkok, 2024: The pandemic reshaped Thailand’s culinary landscape. Vivin, a once-thriving importer of European delicacies, faced a 90% business collapse due to COVID-19 restrictions. Yet, this crisis birthed a new era of local luxury food production.

Thais, becoming more health-conscious and environmentally aware, turned to local ingredients. Vivin pivoted, offering Thai-sourced gourmet items. Celebrity chef Ian Kittichai, for instance, swapped Japanese fish for Phuket’s catch. This shift wasn’t just survival; it was a “food awakening.”

Vivin’s grocery-cum-restaurant in Bangkok’s Asok district flourished. Demand surged for local products like Sloane’s guanciale and Jartisann cheese. This trend extended to other sectors, notably chocolate, with Kad Kokoa’s single-origin Thai cocoa gaining traction.

Generation Z, in particular, champions sustainability and transparency. Research shows they are keen on knowing their food’s origin. This mindset is reshaping the food industry, making local, sustainable products mainstream.

Joe Sloane, a British chef-turned-meat producer, notes a stark contrast from his arrival in Thailand 17 years ago. Back then, imported ingredients were a status symbol. Now, the narrative has flipped.

The pandemic’s silver lining? A culinary revolution, rooted in local flavors and sustainable practices. Thailand’s food scene, once dominated by imports, now celebrates its own gourmet treasures.
