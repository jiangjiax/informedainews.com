### CRISPR Gene-Editing Therapy Launched for UK Blood Disorder Patients

Gene-editing therapy, CRISPR, makes its debut on the UK's National Health Service (NHS), targeting beta thalassaemia, a blood disorder. Stem cells are extracted, corrected, and then reinserted. The aim is to eliminate the need for lifelong, frequent blood transfusions. Beta thalassaemia impairs the production of haemoglobin, which is crucial for oxygen transport. This genetic condition affects energy levels, breathing, and life span. It marks a significant step forward in medical innovation.



### Liquid Water Discovered Deep in Martian Rocks

NASA's Insight lander discovered liquid water deep in Mars' crust. The lander, active from 2018 to 2022, used a seismometer to detect Mars quakes, revealing seismic signals of water. This is the first direct evidence of liquid water on Mars, found at depths of 10 to 20 kilometers.

The discovery answers where Mars' ancient water went. While some evaporated into space, much likely remains underground. This finding challenges Mars colonization plans, as accessing this water would require drilling deep into the planet's crust.

The presence of liquid water deep underground could also indicate potential habitats for life, suggesting future Mars missions might focus on exploring these subterranean environments.



### Google's AI-Powered Screenshots App Enhances Pixel 9 Management

Google's new Screenshots app, exclusive to Pixel 9 series devices, simplifies managing vast collections of screenshots. Using AI dubbed "Gemini Nano," the app creates titles and summaries for each screenshot, enhancing searchability.

At a demo, a screenshot of a hair dyeing guide was summarized with a headline. Users can search by typing or speaking queries, like asking for a Wi-Fi code, and the app quickly surfaces relevant screenshots.

This tool, alongside other AI features like Made You Look and Gemini Live, marks a significant leap in practical AI applications, making daily tasks more efficient.



### Linktree Acquires Social Media Scheduler Plann

Linktree, a link-in-bio platform, has acquired Plann, a social media scheduling tool. Plann, based in Sydney, will initially operate as usual. Linktree plans to integrate Plann's scheduling features into its own platform, aiming to simplify content distribution for its 50 million users.

Linktree's CEO, Alex Zaccaria, emphasized the desire to streamline content management for creators, allowing them more time for creation. This acquisition is Linktree's fourth, following previous purchases of link-in-bio competitors and a music link aggregation platform.

Linktree also introduced a beta social commerce feature this year, enabling creators to add storefronts to their bio pages and earn commissions on sales.



### Deep-Live-Cam Software Enables Realistic Face Swapping

Deep-Live-Cam, a new software, has gone viral. It swaps faces from photos onto live webcam feeds. The tech tracks pose, lighting, and expressions. Videos of Elon Musk and J.D. Vance imitations spread fast.

The software is open source, topping GitHub's trending list. It combines several existing tools. A key component, "inswapper," uses a vast dataset of facial images. This AI model understands facial structures and dynamics. It separates identity from pose and expression, enabling realistic swaps.

This tech raises concerns about deception. Its rapid development underscores the ease of remote fraud. The implications are clear: technology's pace outstrips our ethical considerations.



### MIT Releases Comprehensive AI Risk Repository

MIT researchers have compiled a database of AI risks, aiming to guide policymakers and industry stakeholders. The repository, dubbed an "AI risk repository," catalogs over 700 risks, categorized by factors like intentionality and domains such as discrimination.

Peter Slattery, lead researcher, highlights the repository's purpose: to provide a comprehensive, accessible database that updates over time. Existing risk frameworks often overlook significant risks, with some covering as little as 20% of identified subdomains.

The repository, developed in collaboration with multiple institutions, includes risks often neglected in other frameworks, such as AI-generated spam and pollution of the information ecosystem.

Slattery emphasizes the repository's potential to streamline risk assessment, saving time and enhancing oversight. However, its impact on actual regulation remains uncertain. The MIT team plans to use the repository to evaluate how well different risks are being addressed, aiming to identify and rectify gaps in organizational responses.



### NIST approves post-quantum encryption standards.

NIST has approved three post-quantum encryption algorithms designed to protect data against future quantum computer attacks. One of these, ML-KEM, is used to secure data across public networks. The other two, ML-DSA and SLH-DSA, are essential for handling digital signatures, which are crucial for online identity authentication.

A fourth algorithm, FN-DSA, is expected to be approved later this year. NIST is also evaluating additional backup algorithms based on different mathematical principles, with the goal of selecting one or two by 2024.

NIST strongly urges the immediate adoption of these new standards. Full integration takes time, and preparing against potential attacks is vital. These standards, developed under the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Project, are intended to ensure data safety in an era threatened by quantum computing.
