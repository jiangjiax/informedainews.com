### Efficient Thermostat Settings for Energy Savings

During the summer heat, set your thermostat to 78°F when you're at home, 82°F at night, and 85°F when you're away. In winter, keep it at 68°F and reduce it by 7-10°F for eight hours daily. This approach can reduce your annual energy bill by up to 10%.

A common misconception is that lowering the AC temperature cools the space faster; it actually only achieves a 15-20°F difference from the outdoor temperature.

Optimal thermostat placement is essential: avoid areas with drafts or direct sunlight. Install it on an interior wall in a frequently used area for the best performance.

Smart or programmable thermostats automate these settings, minimizing manual adjustments and increasing energy savings.

### US States Plan to Ban Gas-Powered Cars by 2035

California is spearheading the movement, mandating the transition to zero-emission vehicles by 2035. This policy, adopted by 11 other states, seeks to gradually eliminate gas-powered cars, thereby reducing air pollution and associated health costs. Each state, adhering to California's rigorous standards under the Clean Air Act, establishes its own timeline, with the majority converging on the 2035 target.

The significance of this shift lies in the replacement of traditional, pollutant-emitting vehicles with electric vehicles (EVs), which operate on electricity stored in batteries and produce no tailpipe emissions.

This transition, while challenging, is essential. It tackles environmental degradation and public health concerns, aligning with broader climate objectives. The adoption of EVs is not merely about cleaner air but also about protecting natural landscapes and human health. It represents a pivotal step towards a sustainable future, where technology and policy unite to address environmental challenges.

### Study Links Wildfire Smoke to Over 52,000 Deaths in California

  alt="Study Links Wildfire Smoke to Over 52,000 Deaths in California"
/>

Wildfire smoke in California has been linked to over 52,000 deaths in the past decade, according to a study by UCLA researchers. The smoke, containing high levels of PM2.5 particles, infiltrates deep into lungs and bloodstreams, leading to severe health problems such as heart disease and asthma. These particles, which are also present in vehicle exhaust and indoor smoke, pose a particularly high risk when originating from wildfires.

The study emphasizes that PM2.5 from wildfires is more harmful than that from other sources, resulting in an estimated 12,000 premature deaths in 2018 alone. The economic impact is immense, with health costs totaling $432 billion over the decade.

This research highlights the urgent need for improved forest management and climate change mitigation strategies to lessen both the health and economic burdens of wildfires. As global warming exacerbates California's fire seasons, proactive measures are essential to protect public health and the economy.

### Apollo 8 Astronaut William Anders Passes Away in Plane Crash

William Anders, the Apollo 8 astronaut and photographer of the iconic "Earthrise" image, passed away at 90 in a solo plane crash off the San Juan Islands. His legacy includes the first color photo of Earth from space, a poignant image that ignited the environmental movement by unveiling our planet's vulnerability.

A retired major general, Anders piloted the Apollo 8 mission, which was the first to orbit the moon. The "Earthrise" photo, taken during this mission, depicted Earth rising above the lunar surface, a striking contrast of color and life against the barren moonscape. This image profoundly altered humanity's view of Earth, highlighting its isolation and beauty within the cosmos.

Despite the inherent risks, Anders firmly believed in the mission's significance, estimating a one in three chance of failure. His bravery and the lasting impact of his work continue to inspire ongoing exploration and environmental responsibility.

Anders' life was distinguished by service, ranging from his tenure as a fighter pilot to his contributions in nuclear energy and diplomacy. He and his wife established the Heritage Flight Museum, dedicated to preserving aviation history. His passing is deeply mourned by family, friends, and a world forever transformed by his cosmic vision.

### Binance Introduces Spot Copy Trading for Automated Cryptocurrency Investing

<img

  alt="Binance Introduces Spot Copy Trading for Automated Cryptocurrency Investing"
/>

**Summary:**
In October 2023, Binance introduced Spot Copy Trading, allowing users to mimic experienced traders' strategies in the cryptocurrency market. This feature simplifies investing by automatically replicating trades of selected "signalers" (experienced traders). Users can view and copy these traders' portfolio configurations, benefiting from their expertise without manual intervention. Signalers earn passive income through a share of profits and transaction fees from followers. The process involves selecting a signaler based on performance metrics like maximum drawdown and Sharpe ratio, then setting investment parameters to start copying trades.

**Key Terms Explained:**
- **Spot Copy Trading:** A feature where users can automatically copy the trading strategies of experienced traders in real-time.
- **Signaler:** An experienced trader whose strategies are followed by others.
- **Maximum Drawdown (MDD):** The largest observed loss from a peak to a trough of a portfolio, before a new peak is attained. It measures the maximum percentage that a portfolio could drop.
- **Sharpe Ratio:** A measure of the excess return per unit of risk in an investment asset. It indicates how much risk an investor is taking to achieve returns.

**Insights:**
Spot Copy Trading democratizes access to sophisticated trading strategies, potentially leveling the playing field for novice investors. However, it's crucial for users to understand the risks involved, as blindly following others can lead to significant losses. The feature's educational aspect, allowing observation without active copying, is a valuable tool for learning market dynamics and risk management.

### Exploring Viral Loops for Sustainable Product Growth

Viral loops are the engines of exponential growth for modern products. These loops operate on a simple principle: users share a product, leading others to join, and the cycle repeats. This mechanism is both scalable and cost-effective, making it a cornerstone for companies like LinkedIn, YouTube, and Slack.

The article delineates ten types of viral loops, categorized into four groups. The most potent is the Word of Mouth Loop, where exceptional product quality compels users to share it spontaneously. Organic Loops, another significant category, include Inherent Loops, where product utility depends on widespread adoption (e.g., Zoom), and Collaborative Loops, where collaboration enhances value (e.g., Dropbox).

Understanding these loops empowers companies to strategically integrate them, driving rapid and sustainable growth. The key lies in creating products that naturally encourage sharing and collaboration, thereby perpetuating the viral cycle.

### Study Finds Internet Access Linked to Higher Well-being

  alt="Study Finds Internet Access Linked to Higher Well-being"
/>

The internet, often criticized for its negative effects on mental health, may not be the villain it's portrayed to be. A comprehensive study from Oxford University, covering 16 years and 2.4 million individuals across 168 countries, indicates that internet access is associated with higher levels of well-being. The research shows that individuals with internet access typically report greater life satisfaction, positive experiences, and social contentment.

However, the study did observe a decline in community well-being among young women aged 15 to 24. This might be due to pre-existing dissatisfaction driving increased online activity, rather than the internet causing the discontent.

Critics point out that the intensity of internet use, rather than just access, can be problematic. Overuse of social media platforms, which are designed with advertisers in mind rather than user well-being, can lead to issues. An example is a remote Amazon village that was connected to the internet, where initial excitement turned into concerns about excessive screen time and its effects on daily life.

In summary, the internet, like any tool, can be either beneficial or harmful depending on its use. It's not the access that causes harm, but the misuse. The solution lies in moderation and mindful engagement.

### Unlocking Netflix's Hidden Genres with Secret Codes

Netflix's interface often feels restrictive. However, a hidden menu, accessible through specific URLs with numeric codes, opens a vast library of over 36,000 niche genres. These codes, available on sites like Netflix-Codes.com, let users delve into categories beyond the usual offerings. For example, code 81466194 directs you to 90-Minute Movies.

A Chrome extension, Better Browse for Netflix, simplifies access by adding a "Browse All" option, making navigation through these hidden categories effortless. This system allows viewers to bypass Netflix's algorithm and discover content perfectly suited to their preferences.

* **URLs with numeric codes**: Specific web addresses that include numbers, used to access hidden Netflix categories.
* **Chrome extension**: A small software program that enhances the functionality of the Google Chrome browser.
