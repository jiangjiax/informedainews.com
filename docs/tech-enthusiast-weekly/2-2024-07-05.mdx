The team from Beihang University has recently developed a super-resolution photonic force microscope, achieving sub-femtonewton-level mechanical sensing in aqueous solutions for the first time. It detected the smallest electric field force at 108.2 aN, with a sensitivity of 1.8 fN/√Hz. This technology combines ion resonance nanoprobes, optical three-dimensional super-resolution positioning, and machine learning, addressing the challenge of weak force measurements in aqueous environments.

The applications of this microscope are extensive, particularly in studying extremely weak interactions between DNA molecules. Traditional theories suggest that complementary DNA strands require close contact to pair in aqueous solutions, but this new tool reveals the possibility of long-range forces. Additionally, the technology can be used to study interactions of molecules such as CRISPR proteins.

Detecting extremely weak forces in aqueous solutions is crucial for understanding the operation of biological molecules. Previously, the highest sensitivity for force measurements in aqueous solutions was about 10 fN/√Hz, but the new method has elevated this sensitivity to the sub-femtonewton level, providing an effective tool for studying long-range interactions of biological molecules in physiological environments.

Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, the team improved force measurement accuracy by using lower potential well stiffness, higher positioning precision, and a large amount of positioning data. They also introduced a cylindrical lens positioning method from super-resolution imaging to refine the final steps of three-dimensional force measurement.

This research is not only scientifically significant but also opens new avenues for future studies on biological molecules.

Kai Chen, an alumnus of Zhejiang University and a Ph.D. from the California Institute of Technology, is currently conducting postdoctoral research at the University of California, Berkeley. He collaborates with his advisor, Jennifer Doudna, focusing on the improvement of the CRISPR gene editor. Their research has revealed the key to enhancing the efficiency of the Cas9 protein—the modification of the wedge domain.

The CRISPR system, composed of guide RNA and Cas proteins, is widely used in gene editing. However, the enhancement of Cas9 efficiency has been a challenge. Chen Kai has significantly improved the editing efficiency by modifying the GeoCas9 protein through directed evolution strategies.

Their findings indicate that amino acid mutations in the wedge domain can strengthen the binding of Cas9 to DNA and expand the recognition range. This strategy is not only applicable to GeoCas9 but can also be extended to other Cas9 proteins, with efficiency improvements of over a hundredfold.

Chen Kai's research not only changes our understanding of the structural function of Cas9 proteins but also provides a new pathway for developing more efficient gene editing tools. His work combines theory and application, showcasing the depth and breadth of scientific research.

### Global Undersea Cable Project to Transfer Renewable Energy

Entrepreneurs are planning a massive undersea cable project. Six cables, each over 2,000 miles long, would span the Atlantic, connecting Europe and North America with the aim of transmitting 6 gigawatts of renewable energy. This is equivalent to the power output of six nuclear plants, moving energy at the speed of light.

The concept is to harness the sun's daily cycle. When Europe is sunny and has excess power, it could send this energy west to the U.S. Later, when the sun is over America, Europe would receive the energy back. It's a straightforward idea.

This is not merely a fantasy. Similar projects are emerging globally. Europe already connects with its neighbors through sea cables. The UK links with Belgium, Norway, the Netherlands, and Denmark. They are also considering a solar and wind link with Morocco.

Australia plans to send solar power to Singapore. India and Saudi Arabia aim to connect via the Arabian Sea. These cables are not just about energy; they are reshaping geopolitics, shifting power struggles to the ocean depths.

### Ultra-Precise Atomic Clock Sets New Standards in Timekeeping

  alt="Ultra-Precise Atomic Clock Sets New Standards in Timekeeping"

Scientists have constructed the world's most accurate clock. Its precision is such that it would only lose one second over 300 billion years—more than twice the age of the universe. This clock employs strontium atoms, which oscillate 429 trillion times per second, a frequency measured by visible light rather than microwaves.

The clock's accuracy is vital for technologies such as GPS and communication. It also paves the way for new discoveries in physics, aiding in the measurement of how gravity influences time on minute scales. This innovation could reveal subtle phenomena predicted by theories like Einstein's general relativity.

The clock operates by confining thousands of strontium atoms within a laser grid, known as an "optical lattice." This configuration minimizes errors arising from laser fluctuations and atomic collisions. The outcome is a precision of a trillionth of a second over 300 billion years.

This advancement in timekeeping not only enhances our everyday technologies but also broadens our comprehension of the universe's fundamental laws.

### MIT Researchers Uncover How Microscopic Ice Flaws Affect Global Sea Levels

MIT researchers have developed a model to predict ice flow based on microscopic flaws in ice. This model reveals how these tiny defects influence glacier movement and, consequently, sea level rise.

Traditionally, ice sheets were seen as monolithic. However, this new model shows they respond variably to warming. It focuses on two microscopic mechanisms: "dislocation creep" and "grain boundary sliding." These mechanisms determine how ice deforms under stress.

The model uses data like environmental temperature and ice crystal size to estimate which mechanism dominates in different areas. This helps predict where ice is more likely to flow and melt into the sea.

Comparing the model's predictions with actual ice flow data from Antarctica shows good agreement. This suggests the model can accurately forecast future ice movement and sea level rise.

This research is crucial as it provides a more nuanced understanding of how ice sheets respond to climate change. It helps refine predictions of catastrophic sea level rise, aiding in preparedness and mitigation efforts.

### Tsinghua team develops wide-area wavefront sensing chip, revolutionizing astronomical observation technology.

Atmospheric turbulence, akin to ghostly apparitions in the air, has long plagued astronomical observations. A team from Tsinghua University has developed the Wide-field Wavefront Computing Sensor Chip (WISE), which achieves real-time detection and prediction of atmospheric turbulence within a range of over 1100 arcseconds. This technology boasts a large field of view, high resolution, and strong robustness, with its sensing range nearly a thousand times greater than traditional methods.

The detection capability of the WISE chip is equivalent to the combined power of hundreds or even thousands of traditional wavefront sensors. It is widely applied in optical systems, enabling extensive detection and prediction of atmospheric turbulence, correcting turbulence disturbances, and achieving efficient collection and precise reconstruction of optical signals over large areas.

In a ground-to-moon observation experiment, WISE achieved real-time detection of approximately 500 spatially coherent turbulent wavefronts within a 1100 arcsecond field of view at a speed of 30Hz. The observational performance of a single chip is equivalent to nearly 1000 traditional wavefront sensors.

The WISE chip has broken through the barriers to wide-field atmospheric turbulence observation, restored the spatially non-uniform distribution of atmospheric turbulence, and revealed the dynamic patterns of atmospheric turbulence. Based on the WISE chip and a spatio-temporal neural network model, high-precision turbulence prediction within a large field of view has been achieved, reducing the predicted wavefront error from 224nm to 109nm, a significant improvement over traditional adaptive optics.

The Imaging and Intelligent Technology Interdisciplinary Team at Tsinghua University continues to innovate in the field of computational imaging, empowering astronomy with computation and opening a new chapter in computational astronomical imaging. In the future, the laboratory will further leverage the advantages of meta-imaging wide-field wavefront sensing to support the next generation of wide-field, high-resolution ground-based optical sky surveys.
