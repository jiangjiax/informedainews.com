### Artificial Metabolase Developed for Targeted Cancer Immunotherapy

  alt="Artificial Metabolase Developed for Targeted Cancer Immunotherapy"
/>

Scientists at Shanghai Jiao Tong University have developed a new approach to cancer treatment. They've created an "artificial metabolase" that tweaks tumor cell metabolism, sparking an immune response. This method, detailed in Nature Nanotechnology, targets a broad metabolic marker in tumors, activating nearby immune cells to attack.

Traditional cancer treatments like surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation often lead to drug resistance and side effects. Immunotherapy, which uses the body's immune system to fight cancer, has shown promise but faces challenges like over-activation and individual variability.

The artificial metabolase mimics the action of natural enzymes, specifically xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), which plays a role in converting certain compounds in the body. By doing so, it triggers the production of uric acid within tumor cells. This uric acid acts as a signal, prompting immune cells like macrophages to attack the tumor.

This research, led by Professors Ling Daishun and Li Fangyuan, marks a shift towards more precise, metabolic-based cancer therapies. It's a promising step that could revolutionize how we treat not just cancer, but other diseases linked to metabolic abnormalities.



### 3D-Printed Ceramic Monoliths for Efficient PFAS Removal

  alt="3D-Printed Ceramic Monoliths for Efficient PFAS Removal"
/>

British scientists at Bath University have developed a method to remove toxic PFAS chemicals from water using 3D-printed ceramic lattices. These structures, known as "monoliths," are made from ceramic infused with indium oxide, which binds to PFAS molecules.

The monoliths, which resemble stacked waffles, are designed with a high surface area to maximize PFAS capture. In tests, they removed 53% of PFOA from water within three hours. After a heat treatment at 500°C, the monoliths can be reused, with efficiency improving to 75% removal by the third cycle.

This process is energy-efficient and scalable, requiring no external energy beyond the initial heat treatment for regeneration. The simplicity and effectiveness of this method make it a promising addition to wastewater treatment facilities.

PFAS, known as "forever chemicals," are persistent in the environment and linked to various health issues. This new technology offers a practical solution to a significant environmental and health challenge.



### New Technique Reveals Hidden Molecular Energy States

  alt="New Technique Reveals Hidden Molecular Energy States"
/>

Scientists at the University of Bath have discovered a novel method to visualize hidden energy states in molecules by employing light particles. This groundbreaking advancement, as outlined in a recent study, has the potential to influence various sectors including pharmaceuticals, security, forensics, environmental science, art conservation, and medicine.

The method utilizes a phenomenon known as "hyper-Raman," wherein two light particles interact with a molecule and merge, altering their color. The resulting color change, when captured, discloses the molecule's energy state. Hyper-Raman outperforms conventional Raman scattering by penetrating deeper into tissues with reduced damage and enhanced image clarity.

A significant finding was the use of chiral light—light with a twist—to elucidate the three-dimensional structure of molecules. This was accomplished by positioning molecules on minuscule gold nanospikes, which function as antennas, concentrating light onto the molecules and amplifying the hyper-Raman signal.

This technique could transform the way we analyze pharmaceutical components, detect environmental contaminants, authenticate art, and even diagnose diseases by identifying molecular alterations. The research, spanning several decades, highlights the extensive process from theoretical development to practical implementation in the field of science.
