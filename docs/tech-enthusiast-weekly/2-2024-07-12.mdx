### EU Closes Apple Pay Antitrust Probe with Binding Commitments

The EU closed its Apple Pay antitrust probe. Apple agreed to open NFC tech for rival wallets by July 25. This allows competitors to offer "tap and go" payments on iPhones and use Face ID, Touch ID, and passcodes for security.

Apple must allow users to set third-party wallets as default. The EU initially probed Apple Pay in 2020, focusing on NFC access. In 2022, the EU found that Apple blocked rivals from using NFC, stifling competition.

Apple proposed changes for 2024, including free access to NFC via APIs, excluding the secure element chip but offering "Host Card Emulation (HCE)" mode for secure transactions.

The EU refined Apple's commitments after industry feedback, with key changes including removing the need for a Payment Service Provider (PSP) license and adapting HCE to industry standards.

Apple's commitments exceed new EU rules, the Digital Markets Act (DMA). These pledges bind Apple for ten years, with potential penalties for non-compliance.

Apple's statement confirms they will enable NFC payments for various services while maintaining Apple Pay's security.



### Helsing Raises $487M for AI Defense Expansion in Baltic Region

Helsing, a defense AI firm, has just raised $487 million. They are expanding into Estonia with the aim of strengthening defenses against Russia. This move aligns with NATO's concerns over the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Helsing's technology enhances drone and jet fighter capabilities and assists in battlefield decision-making. They have partnered with Airbus and several defense ministries.

Gundbert Scherf, co-CEO of the company, views their technology as essential for defending European democracies. Estonia's Prime Minister, Kaja Kallas, welcomes Helsing's presence.

Torsten Reil, Helsing's co-CEO, emphasizes the urgency to create a "capability gap" to deter and defend against potential broader threats.

The firm utilizes its own compute resources and some from unnamed third parties for security reasons. They are also working on Project Centaur, an AI for air combat that employs reinforcement learning.

This latest funding values Helsing at approximately $5.4 billion. Investors include Spotify's Daniel Ek and Saab AB.

Defense technology is gaining momentum with Western investors, reflecting the increase in defense budgets. Helsing stands out as a significant European player in this field.



### OSIRIS-REx Asteroid Sample: Clues to Life's Origins

  alt="OSIRIS-REx Asteroid Sample: Clues to Life's Origins"
/>

NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission successfully returned 121.6 grams of asteroid Bennu. Initial analysis indicates that the sample is abundant in carbon, nitrogen, and organic compounds—essential elements for life as we understand it. The sample also contains pristine magnesium-sodium phosphate, a first for any meteorite.

Bennu's composition suggests a history involving water, possibly originating from a small, ancient oceanic world. This discovery prompts questions about how these elements aggregated and provides insights into Bennu's past.

The asteroid's elements closely match those of the Sun, preserved since the birth of the solar system. This makes Bennu a time capsule, offering a window into the early solar system and potentially the prebiotic chemistry that preceded life on Earth.

Dante Lauretta, the principal investigator of OSIRIS-REx, underscores the significance of studying these materials, vital for comprehending the solar system's formation and the origins of life.

In the coming years, various laboratories will examine Bennu's sample, anticipating further insights into the origins and evolution of Earth-like planets.
