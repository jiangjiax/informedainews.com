# Tech Enthusiast Weekly(2024-07-19) : WebRTC-Based Peer-to-Peer File Sharing Using Firebase

## WebRTC-Based Peer-to-Peer File Sharing Using Firebase

ShareDrop simplifies file sharing. Like AirDrop, it transfers files directly between devices, bypassing servers. It uses WebRTC for secure peer-to-peer transfers and Firebase for coordination.

No setup is needed if devices are on the same network. Open sharedrop.io on each device, and they connect. It also works across different networks.

WebRTC allows secure data exchange between browsers and apps. Firebase supports app development with real-time databases.

  alt="EU's Artificial Intelligence Act Takes Effect: A New Chapter in Global AI Regulation"
/>

The EU's Artificial Intelligence Act came into effect on August 1, marking the world's first comprehensive AI regulatory framework. Aimed at protecting citizens, promoting innovation, and establishing Europe's leading position in the AI field, the Act is implemented in phases, with stringent regulations for high-risk applications such as credit scoring and employee monitoring.

Companies face increased compliance costs, requiring investments in new regulations and appointing compliance officers to study policies. Penalties for non-compliance can reach up to 35 million euros or 7% of annual revenue.

The EU's AI Act has global implications, particularly affecting China and the United States. China has already released interim measures for the management of generative AI services, while the US is also advancing AI regulatory legislation.

**Explanation:**
- **GDPR**: General Data Protection Regulation, the EU's data protection law.

  alt="OpenAI's Secret Project 'Strawberry' Aims to Enhance AI Reasoning"
/>

OpenAI is working on a secret project called "Strawberry," aimed at boosting AI's reasoning skills. This project could enable AI to tackle complex math and science problems, plan ahead, and conduct "deep research" online.

Strawberry's predecessor, Q*, already showed promise in solving tough scientific and mathematical challenges. OpenAI sees mastering math as key to enhancing AI's reasoning, potentially rivaling human intelligence.

The project is so confidential that even within OpenAI, details are scarce. However, clues suggest Strawberry might use a "post-training" method, refining models after initial training to excel at specific tasks. This approach echoes Stanford's "Self-Taught Reasoner," which theoretically could push AI to superhuman intelligence levels.

OpenAI's roadmap for AI development includes five stages, from chatbots to AI that can organize tasks. Strawberry is likely a step towards the second stage, where AI becomes a "reasoner," capable of human-level problem-solving.

If successful, Strawberry could redefine AI's capabilities, allowing it to make significant scientific discoveries, develop new software, and execute complex tasks autonomously. This advancement would bring us closer to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
