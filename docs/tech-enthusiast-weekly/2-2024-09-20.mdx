### Scholar Develops 3D Tool to Reverse-Engineer Cancer

A scholar is developing a 3D tool to reverse-engineer cancer. This method aims to understand cancer's growth and spread by recreating it in a controlled environment. The tool uses advanced technology to mimic the intricate structures within the human body where cancer typically develops.

Reverse-engineering involves breaking down complex systems to understand their components and functions. In this case, the goal is to dissect cancer's behavior to find effective treatments. By creating 3D models, researchers can observe how cancer cells interact with their surroundings, offering insights that could lead to new therapies.

This approach could revolutionize cancer research, making it more precise and efficient. Traditional methods often rely on trial and error, which can be slow and costly. The 3D tool promises a more systematic way to study cancer, potentially speeding up the discovery of effective treatments.

In essence, this scholar's work is a bold step towards demystifying cancer. By reverse-engineering it, we may finally gain the upper hand in the fight against this devastating disease.

  alt="SpaceX Achieves First Commercial Spacewalk with Polaris Dawn Mission"
/>

On September 12, 2024, SpaceX made history with the first commercial spacewalk. The "Polaris Dawn" mission, launched from NASA's Kennedy Space Center, saw two civilian astronauts venture into space. This marked a new milestone in private space exploration.

The mission, commanded by Jared Isaacman and piloted by Scott Kidd Poteet, reached an altitude of 1,400.7 kilometers—the highest since the Apollo era. Isaacman and Sarah Gillis conducted the spacewalk, lasting 1 hour and 46 minutes. Isaacman marveled at Earth's beauty, calling it a "perfect world."

SpaceX developed specialized gear for the mission, including new space suits described as "fabric armor." The Dragon spacecraft was modified with a "Skywalker" hatch, designed for easy external movement. A laser communication system tested during the mission could revolutionize space communications.

The mission also included 36 scientific experiments, providing crucial data on human health in space. NASA's Jancy McPhee noted the importance of such data for future lunar and Mars missions.

Isaacman, who funded the mission, sees it as a step toward deeper space exploration. The success of "Polaris Dawn" underscores SpaceX's leadership in private space travel and paves the way for future deep-space missions.



### FTC Report Exposes Extensive User Surveillance by Social Media and Online Video Firms

<img

  alt="FTC Report Exposes Extensive User Surveillance by Social Media and Online Video Firms"
/>

The FTC report reveals that major social media and online video firms—Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, Discord, Reddit, Amazon, Snap, TikTok, and Twitter/X—conduct extensive surveillance on users. Between January 2019 and December 2020, these companies collected vast amounts of personal data, including age, gender, income, and marital status. This information was shared with third parties for targeted advertising.

Users have limited control over data collection. Most firms feed personal information into automated systems for content and ad delivery. Few offer comprehensive opt-out options. Notably, none provided a full list of data recipients to the FTC.

The report criticizes data-minimization practices as inadequate. Some companies failed to delete data upon user request, even when required by law. The FTC recommends federal privacy regulations to address these issues.

Discord and Google disputed the findings. Discord claims its model differs, emphasizing user privacy controls. Google asserts strict privacy policies, prohibiting ad personalization for minors and "made for kids" content.

The FTC's report underscores the need for stronger privacy protections. It highlights the disconnect between corporate claims and actual data practices, urging legislative action to ensure user data is handled responsibly.

The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, perched atop a Chilean mountain, is set to revolutionize astronomy. Over the next decade, it will capture millions of celestial objects daily—more than 100 every second. Every three nights, the telescope will reposition itself to create a high-quality mosaic of the night sky, spanning ultraviolet, visible, and infrared light. This unprecedented chronicle will allow scientists to track cosmic changes with unparalleled precision.

Bob Mann, an astronomer at the University of Edinburgh, describes the project as a blend of depth, spectral coverage, and temporal resolution never before achieved. The observatory aims to detect transient phenomena—events that change or disappear—offering insights into the universe's origins and fate.

The Rubin Observatory will generate 20 terabytes of data nightly, totaling 60 petabytes over ten years. This flood of information will be distributed to seven data centers worldwide, enabling scientists to search for new astronomical phenomena.

Mario Jurić, an astronomer at the University of Washington, highlights the observatory's potential to map the solar system and reveal its formation and evolution. The data will also track variable stars and supernovae, providing "standard candles" to measure cosmic distances.

Igor Andreoni of the University of North Carolina and Raffaella Margutti of the University of California, Berkeley, plan to use the data to study cosmic explosions and transient phenomena, such as neutron star mergers.

In essence, the Rubin Observatory will transform our understanding of the cosmos, capturing its dynamism and evolution like never before.



### NASA's Endeavour Shuttle Mission: Mapping Earth in 3D

  alt="NASA's Endeavour Shuttle Mission: Mapping Earth in 3D"
/>

In 2000, Commander Kevin Kregel led the Endeavour shuttle mission to create a 3D map of Earth. The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) utilized a 200-foot mast to gather elevation data. Despite facing technical hurdles—such as the mast's flexibility and frozen gas jets—innovative solutions, including a "fly-casting" maneuver, allowed the team to map over 80% of Earth's land.

SRTM's data remains crucial, supporting studies on wildfires, soil erosion, flood risks, and more. The mission's success was contingent on overcoming obstacles: cloud cover obscured many regions, aerial mapping was expensive, and political tensions restricted access. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) developed SRTM to penetrate clouds and map extensive areas in a single flight.

The SRTM instrument, now housed at the Smithsonian, features a sophisticated mast that folds like an accordion. In orbit, it extends to two-thirds the length of a football field. The mission's radar, mounted at the mast's end and inside the shuttle, provided continuous 3D views, faster and more accurate than previous methods.

Key challenges included the mast bending under inertia and a frozen gas system. Engineer Bill Layman's "fly-casting" plan, inspired by fly-fishing, used shuttle thrusters to position the mast. This technique, both efficient and effective, ensured the mission's success.

SRTM's legacy continues, with its detailed maps still informing global research and applications.

  alt="SRTM Mission Data Revolutionizes Earth Understanding"
/>

In 2000, the Endeavour shuttle's SRTM mission mapped Earth's terrain in 3D. This data, foundational for NASADEM, aids disaster response and urban planning. Over 19 years, 12 TB of data was collected on 320 tapes, processed by USGS and made public in 2003.

Initially, high-resolution maps covered the U.S., while global maps had lower resolution. By 2015, global maps matched U.S. quality, and in 2020, NASADEM refined SRTM data, enhancing height accuracy and filling gaps.

SRTM data saves lives by predicting landslides and aids healthcare in Africa's rugged terrains. It revealed Peru's deep canyons and Canada's eroded rock formations. Studies on earthquakes, deforestation, and wind turbine impacts rely on SRTM.

Future missions like ICESat, ICESat-2, and GEDI will refine these maps. Gerald Bawden, NASA's SRTM project lead, calls SRTM a "snapshot of nearly the entire globe," invaluable for climate, geology, and urban planning. Scott Hensley, a JPL scientist, sees SRTM as a career highlight, contributing to human progress.

SRTM's legacy endures, a goldmine of information for generations.
