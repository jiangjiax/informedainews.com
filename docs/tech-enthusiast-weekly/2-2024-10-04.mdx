### Justice Department Sues Visa Over Debit Network Monopoly

The U.S. Justice Department has sued Visa, accusing it of maintaining an illegal monopoly over debit payments. The suit claims Visa used "exclusionary" agreements to stifle competition and inflate fees, costing consumers and merchants billions. Attorney General Merrick Garland stated that Visa's monopoly affects the price of "nearly everything."

Visa, with over 60% of U.S. debit transactions, charges over $7 billion annually in processing fees. The DOJ alleges Visa threatened merchants and banks with higher rates if they used competitors, maintaining a dominant position. Visa's agreements with tech giants like Apple and PayPal, designed to neutralize potential threats, also stifled innovation.

Visa called the suit "meritless," arguing it operates in a competitive market with thriving new entrants. However, the DOJ seeks court intervention to prevent Visa's anticompetitive practices.

This lawsuit comes amid heightened regulatory scrutiny of payment networks. Recent deals, like Capital One's acquisition of Discover, aim to challenge Visa and Mastercard's dominance. The outcome could reshape the payment landscape, impacting fees and innovation.

### Flexible RISC-V Microprocessor Revolutionizes Low-Power Computing

Pragmatic Semiconductor has developed the Flex-RV, an ultralow-power 32-bit microprocessor based on the RISC-V architecture. Unlike traditional silicon chips, Flex-RV is made from indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO), a flexible semiconductor that can be printed onto plastic at low temperatures. This innovation eliminates the need for costly protective packaging required for silicon chips in flexible applications.

The Flex-RV is designed to be programmable, capable of running software written in high-level languages like C. It includes a machine learning hardware accelerator, making it suitable for AI applications. With a core area of 17.5 square millimeters and approximately 12,600 logic gates, the chip operates at up to 60 kilohertz while consuming less than 6 milliwatts of power.

Flex-RV's flexibility allows it to function correctly even when bent to a radius of 3 millimeters, with performance varying by only a few percent. This makes it ideal for implantable devices, on-skin computers, and soft robotics.

Pragmatic's goal is to democratize computing by offering a license-free microprocessor, potentially reducing costs to less than a dollar. This could revolutionize wearable healthcare electronics and smart package labels, among other applications.

  alt="Mapping the Fruit Fly Brain: A Breakthrough in Neuroscience"
/>

Researchers have mapped the entire brain of a fruit fly, detailing 139,255 neurons and 50 million connections. This wiring diagram, or connectome, took years to complete. It involved slicing the fly’s brain into 7,000 sections, imaging each with an electron microscope, and using AI to trace neuron paths. Human volunteers corrected AI errors.

The project classified over 8,400 cell types, providing a blueprint for a fly brain. Researchers found neurons that process diverse information and coordinate neural activity. They also identified circuits that halt fly movement.

A computer simulation of part of the fly brain revealed taste processing circuits. This suggests future simulations could explain brain wiring’s role in behavior.

The effort involved researchers from Canada, Germany, and the UK. They published their findings in nine Nature papers. Dr. Anita Devineni called the wiring diagram a “landmark achievement.”

Next, researchers aim to map the mouse brain within five to ten years. Mapping the human brain, with its 86 billion neurons, is far more complex. It would require a zettabyte of data—equivalent to a year’s internet traffic.

Instead, researchers may map parts of the human brain. This could help understand neuropsychiatric disorders. Dr. John Ngai of the US National Institutes of Health emphasized the importance of understanding brain wiring to address brain disorders.

  alt="OpenAI Secures $66 Billion Investment, Valuation Surges to $1570 Billion"
/>

OpenAI has secured a $66 billion (approximately ¥463 billion) investment, boosting its valuation to $1570 billion (approximately ¥11 trillion). This marks the company's largest venture capital deal to date. The funding round was led by Thrive Capital, with Microsoft, NVIDIA, and SoftBank also participating. Notably, Apple did not join this round.

The investment is structured as convertible debt, meaning it will convert to equity if OpenAI transitions to a for-profit entity within two years. If not, OpenAI must repay the debt. This move aims to enhance OpenAI's leadership in AI research, boost computational power, and develop AI tools to solve complex problems.

OpenAI predicts its revenue will surge from $37 billion this year to $116 billion next year, then double again to $256 billion by 2025, and reach $1000 billion by 2029.

The deal also includes a unique clause for Thrive Capital: if OpenAI meets revenue targets, Thrive can invest an additional $10 billion at a $1500 billion valuation next year. This could yield significant returns for Thrive.

OpenAI's transition to a for-profit entity faces substantial legal hurdles, requiring complex asset redistribution. The company must compensate its original non-profit structure, which could be challenging given the rapid growth since ChatGPT's launch.

This funding propels OpenAI into a new era, attracting more investors. However, the company must address core issues like leadership changes, safety concerns, and revenue generation to satisfy its new stakeholders.

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a cutting-edge AI technique that enhances the ability of AI systems to understand and generate content by integrating external knowledge. This article delves into building a minimal viable RAG system, breaking down the process into manageable steps.

The RAG framework consists of six key components:
1. **Indexing**: Dividing large documents into manageable chunks and creating semantic vectors for efficient retrieval.
2. **Query Translation**: Transforming user queries to ensure they are accurately understood by the system.
3. **Routing**: Directing queries to the most appropriate processing pipelines.
4. **Query Construction**: Converting natural language queries into machine-readable formats.
5. **Retrieval**: Finding the most relevant document chunks based on query vectors.
6. **Generation**: Using the retrieved information to generate accurate responses.

The article then walks through constructing a basic RAG system:
1. **Indexing**: Load and split documents, then store them in a vector database.
2. **Retrieval**: Retrieve the most relevant document chunks based on user queries.
3. **Generation**: Use a large language model to generate responses based on the retrieved information.

This simple RAG system, though basic, demonstrates the core principles. However, practical applications require further optimization in each component. The author promises to delve deeper into advanced indexing techniques in future articles.

**Insights**: RAG represents a significant leap in AI's ability to handle complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. By integrating external knowledge, it allows AI to perform tasks that were previously beyond its capabilities, such as specialized analysis and planning.

The app utilizes AI to analyze subtitles and identify spoken sentences through the phone’s microphone, ensuring synchronization with the video.

Each episode includes a summary page with words categorized by difficulty, ranging from Beginner to Proficiency English. Users can save words to practice later using digital flashcards. Wordy integrates data from TMDB and OpenSubtitles.com for accurate subtitles.

During testing with Netflix’s “Wednesday,” the app accurately translated sophisticated terms like “plagued” and “séance.” Currently available in English only, Wordy plans to introduce Spanish in November, followed by French and German. The app is priced at $2.99 per month or $29.99 per year, with an Android version set to launch in November.

Bogyó prioritizes quality over speed, ensuring that each language integration meets his standards.
