# Tech Enthusiast Weekly(2024-08-30) : Automated Wildcard SSL Certificate Management with GitHub Actions

## Automated Wildcard SSL Certificate Management with GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions automate SSL certificate management. It handles wildcard certificates, covering all subdomains. Certificates are stored via git commits. Daily checks for expiring certs trigger renewals within 30 days of expiration. Reports update a markdown file. The system secures both ECDSA and RSA certificates.

Wildcard SSL certificates protect all subdomains of a domain. ECDSA and RSA are cryptographic algorithms used for secure data transmission.

Scientists have made significant breakthroughs in the field of high-temperature superconductivity, developing a new type of superconducting wire with a current density reaching 190 million amperes per square centimeter. This wire is based on barium copper oxide and rare earth elements, with controllable costs and a wide operating temperature range from 4.2K to 77K.

The wire employs ion beam assisted deposition of magnesium oxide substrate technology, prepared through phase separation and strain-driven self-assembly processes. The introduction of nanoscale defects significantly enhances the current-carrying capacity. At 4.2K and 20K under a 7T magnetic field, the pinning force reaches 6.4TN/m3 and 4.2TN/m3, respectively.

This technology is expected to bring about transformative changes in fields such as energy, power, transportation, and healthcare. Particularly in the commercial nuclear fusion sector, HTS wires hold immense potential. Over 40 companies worldwide have invested billions of dollars in developing HTS wires.

Researcher Goyal emphasized that improving cost-effectiveness is key to the large-scale application of superconductors. The findings of this study will guide the industry to further optimize manufacturing conditions and enhance the cost-effectiveness of commercial coated conductors.

NASA's Cold Atom Lab on the International Space Station employs quantum technology to explore space science. It investigates gravity, dark matter, and dark energy, and tests Einstein's theory of relativity in microgravity conditions.

The lab, a pioneering installation on the ISS, utilizes a device known as an atom interferometer. This instrument measures gravity and other forces with exceptional precision, which is vital for grasping the fundamentals of gravity and advancing navigation technology.

In the space environment, these measurements can unveil the composition of planets and satellites, and monitor the movement of water and ice on Earth. The lab's discoveries may also provide insights into dark matter and dark energy, the enigmatic forces that shape the universe.

The Cold Atom Lab cools atoms to temperatures close to absolute zero, producing a state known as Bose-Einstein condensate. This state enables atoms to display quantum behaviors on a more observable scale, facilitating their study.

In microgravity, these quantum states persist longer, affording scientists extended periods for research. The lab's endeavors could pave the way for new quantum technologies and a more profound understanding of the universe's elementary particles.

  alt="DNA Technology for Long-term Data Storage and Computing"
/>

Scientists have developed a method to store data in DNA, offering the potential for storage lasting thousands to millions of years. This technology utilizes a soft polymer, akin to a scaffold for DNA, which can be dried for long-term storage and rehydrated for data retrieval. The polymer, known as dendricolloids, creates a network of nanoscale fibers, enabling high-density data storage—approximately 10 petabytes per cubic centimeter.

This technique ensures data integrity through numerous cycles of drying and rehydrating, significantly more than unprotected DNA. It is optimal for long-term archiving, with DNA half-lives varying from 6,000 years at 4°C to 2 million years at -18°C.

The conversion of data into DNA's ACGT code and its retrieval through RNA sequencing ensures no DNA damage during reading. The system also performs calculations directly within DNA, as demonstrated by solving simple chess and sudoku puzzles.

This breakthrough not only advances DNA data storage but also opens the door for DNA computing.
