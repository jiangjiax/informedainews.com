### New 3D Material Design Method Could Revolutionize Engineering

<img

  alt="New 3D Material Design Method Could Revolutionize Engineering"
/>

Scientists have solved a longstanding issue in material design: the absence of a mathematical foundation for three-dimensional conformal methods. A team led by Professors Qiu Chengwei and Huang Jiping has developed a new technique called Conformality-Assisted Tracing (CAT). This method enables the precise and efficient design of complex 3D structures, surpassing previous geometric constraints.

CAT operates by utilizing steady-state heat flow to generate a 3D grid of lines and surfaces. This grid, which preserves angles and scale, can be employed to design materials that manage heat, light, and other physical properties. The method is forward-looking, designing materials based on desired outcomes rather than modifying existing ones.

This breakthrough has the potential to transform areas such as military stealth technology and industrial applications. The team is now exploring the expansion of CAT's applications to fluid dynamics and elasticity, with the goal of addressing challenges like chip cooling and aircraft insulation.

The name CAT is a playful allusion to the method's tracking nature, akin to a cat stalking its prey. This innovation not only resolves a significant scientific hurdle but also opens new pathways for material science and engineering.



### AI Method Accelerates Material Thermal Property Predictions

  alt="AI Method Accelerates Material Thermal Property Predictions"
/>

MIT researchers have developed a new AI method to predict material thermal properties, specifically how heat moves via phonons, subatomic particles. This prediction is crucial for designing efficient power systems, as 70% of global energy ends up as waste heat.

The challenge lies in predicting the phonon dispersion relation, which maps energy and momentum in crystal structures. Traditional methods, whether AI or non-AI, are slow and computationally heavy.

The new method, a Virtual Node Graph Neural Network (VGNN), introduces flexible virtual nodes to represent phonons. This innovation speeds up predictions by up to a million times compared to traditional methods, and 1000 times faster than other AI methods, all while maintaining accuracy.

VGNN simplifies complex calculations by bypassing unnecessary steps, making it feasible to predict phonon dispersion relations for thousands of materials in seconds. This efficiency opens new possibilities for discovering materials with specific thermal properties, such as superior heat storage or superconductivity.

The method isn't limited to thermal properties; it can extend to other challenging material characteristics like optics and magnetism. This breakthrough could revolutionize material science by enabling faster and more accurate predictions, leading to more efficient and innovative technologies.
