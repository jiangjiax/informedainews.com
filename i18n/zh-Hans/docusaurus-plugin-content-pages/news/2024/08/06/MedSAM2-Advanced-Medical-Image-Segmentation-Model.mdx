MedSAM-2, a new model, segments medical images like a video. It operates on both 2D and 3D images, focusing on organs, tumors, and more. Users provide a single prompt, and it segments all similar objects in subsequent images. Tests indicate it outperforms other models in accuracy and versatility. The code is available on GitHub.
