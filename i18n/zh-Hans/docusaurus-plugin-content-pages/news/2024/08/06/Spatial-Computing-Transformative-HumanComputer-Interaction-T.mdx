Spatial computing, the next-generation human-computer interaction platform, is transforming the way we interact with digital information. Moving away from screen dependency, data is integrated into the physical environment, making interactions more intuitive and natural. This technology combines AR, AI, and geospatial analysis to seamlessly blend digital information with the real world, enhancing the reality experience.

In fields such as education, work, and shopping, spatial computing brings significant changes. In education, it creates immersive learning experiences; in the workplace, it enhances remote collaboration; in the shopping sector, it offers more immersive shopping experiences through AR and MR technologies.

AI plays a crucial role in spatial computing, enabling personalized experiences, the development of autonomous systems, and real-time data processing. However, implementing spatial computing faces challenges such as cost, technical complexity, user training, and data privacy.

Addressing these challenges requires measures such as transparency, data minimization, anonymization, and secure data processing. Spatial computing is not just a future concept but also a transformative tool available today, providing a strategic roadmap for business leaders and technology experts.
