British scientists at Bath University have developed a method to remove toxic PFAS chemicals from water using 3D-printed ceramic lattices. These structures, known as "monoliths," are made from ceramic infused with indium oxide, which binds to PFAS molecules.

The monoliths, which resemble stacked waffles, are designed with a high surface area to maximize PFAS capture. In tests, they removed 53% of PFOA from water within three hours. After a heat treatment at 500Â°C, the monoliths can be reused, with efficiency improving to 75% removal by the third cycle.

This process is energy-efficient and scalable, requiring no external energy beyond the initial heat treatment for regeneration. The simplicity and effectiveness of this method holds promise for integration into existing wastewater treatment facilities.

PFAS, known as "forever chemicals," are persistent in the environment and linked to various health issues. This new approach offers a practical solution to a significant environmental and health challenge.
