Google lost an antitrust case. A U.S. judge declared Google a monopoly in search and text ads. The judge found that Google violated the law by excluding competitors and employing a loophole to maintain its dominance.

The case was significant, filed in 2020 by the Justice Department and several states. The judge scrutinized Google's agreements with Android and Apple, which bolstered its market control.

Google intends to appeal, arguing that its search service is superior and should be user-friendly. Shares fell by 4% following the ruling.

Antitrust laws are designed to prevent monopolies, ensuring fair competition. A monopoly arises when one company dominates a market, often resulting in higher prices and reduced innovation.
