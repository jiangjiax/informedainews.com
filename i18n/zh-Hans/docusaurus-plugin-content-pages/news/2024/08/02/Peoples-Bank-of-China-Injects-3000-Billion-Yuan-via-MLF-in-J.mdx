In July 2024, the People's Bank of China injected 3 trillion yuan into the financial system through two Medium-term Lending Facility (MLF) operations. Both were one-year terms; the first at 1 trillion yuan with a 2.50% interest rate, the second at 2 trillion yuan at 2.30%. This increased the total MLF balance to 72.7 trillion yuan.

Additionally, the bank conducted 0.61 billion yuan in Standing Lending Facility (SLF) operations, all overnight.

MLF and SLF are tools used by central banks to manage liquidity and influence interest rates in the financial system.
