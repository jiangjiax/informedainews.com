Xiaoyin Qu, founder of Heeyo, has developed an AI chatbot tailored for children aged 4-9. The platform boasts over 2,000 interactive games and activities, with the goal of rivaling Minecraft and YouTube. Heeyo secured $3.5 million in seed funding and is now accessible worldwide on Android and iOS.

Safety is a top priority. Heeyo adheres to COPPA guidelines, erasing voice data and refraining from requesting personal information. The AI facilitates educational games, assists with emotional challenges, and adjusts to the child's age and developmental stage.

Heeyo's content team comprises children's book authors and child psychologists, ensuring beneficial outcomes. The AI engine integrates OpenAI, ElevenLabs, and Microsoft Azure, emphasizing translation without data retention.

Revenue is generated through the sale of tokens for games, with future ambitions to establish a developer ecosystem. Qu, formerly of Run the World, envisions a sustainable business with Heeyo, rather than a swift exit.

In summary, Heeyo fills a notable market void by providing a secure, engaging alternative to conventional children's technology. Its emphasis on safety and development positions it as a promising resource for parents.
