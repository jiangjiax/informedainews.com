Saudi Arabia's PIF, one of the world's largest sovereign wealth funds, has signed $50 billion worth of MOUs with six Chinese banks. The deals cover debt, equity, and aim to enhance two-way capital flows. This initiative aligns with Saudi's Vision 2030, which seeks to diversify its economy beyond oil. China, eager to strengthen its ties, welcomes Saudi investments in sectors such as infrastructure and green technology.
