Google is rolling out new Chrome features powered by Gemini. Desktop Lens allows you to click on web items, ask questions, and receive AI-driven answers. You can find similar products, learn about plants, or solve math problems.

"Tab Compare" assists in shopping by summarizing similar items across tabs. History search now utilizes natural language, such as asking for a previously viewed ice cream shop.

These updates aim to make browsing smarter by leveraging AI without compromising privacy.
