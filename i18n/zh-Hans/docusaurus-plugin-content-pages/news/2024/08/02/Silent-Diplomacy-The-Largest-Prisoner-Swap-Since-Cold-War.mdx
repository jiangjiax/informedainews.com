Russia and the West engaged in a silent dance, orchestrating the largest prisoner swap since the Cold War. Moscow prefers closed-door negotiations, away from media glare.

Vladimir Putin hinted at a deal during a February interview, suggesting Russia might return Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. Implicitly, Moscow sought Vadim Krasikov, a suspected Russian agent serving life in Germany.

Rumors of swaps involving jailed figures like Alexei Navalny and Paul Whelan circulated, but Navalny died before any deal materialized.

In June, Gershkovich's spy trial began and swiftly concluded with a 16-year sentence. Simultaneously, US-Russian journalist Alsu Kurmasheva received a six-and-a-half-year sentence in Kazan. The hurried trials signaled a likely swap.

Recent reports indicate Russian political prisoners were moved, fueling speculation of a broader exchange. Belarus's leader, Alexander Lukashenko, agreed to pardon a German citizen, Rico Krieger, possibly part of the swap.

This exchange marks a significant event. Western governments gain released foreigners and Russian dissidents, while Moscow regains its agents. Both sides claim victory.

However, if Russia views "hostage diplomacy" as effective, this may not be the last such exchange. Prisoners, both foreign and Russian, remain potential bargaining chips.
