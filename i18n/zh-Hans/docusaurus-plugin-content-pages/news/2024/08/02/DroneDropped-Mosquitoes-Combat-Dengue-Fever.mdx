Researchers are employing drones to release infected mosquitoes in the battle against dengue fever. These mosquitoes harbor Wolbachia bacteria, which inhibits the virus responsible for dengue. Dengue is a debilitating infection that affects 3.9 billion people annually.

The technique involves drones dispersing groups of 150 mosquitoes across extensive areas. This method disseminates the bacteria among wild mosquito populations, thereby curtailing disease transmission. Trials in Fiji demonstrated that this approach is as effective as conventional ground releases, yet it is safer and more efficient.

The World Mosquito Program (WMP) has already achieved success in Indonesia, where Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes decreased dengue transmission by 77%. With dengue cases having surged thirtyfold over the past half-century, this drone-based strategy presents fresh hope.

Wolbachia is a naturally occurring bacteria found in 60% of insect species. When introduced into mosquitoes, it can thwart the transmission of viruses such as dengue, Zika, and yellow fever.
