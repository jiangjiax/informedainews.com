Paige Bueckers, the basketball star from UConn, is poised to sign a deal with Unrivaled, a new women's league. This move will make her the first NCAA athlete to have an ownership stake in a professional sports league. The deal comes at a time when NCAA rules are relaxing, allowing college players more opportunities for endorsements.

Unrivaled, founded by WNBA players Breanna Stewart and Napheesa Collier, is set to launch in January. Bueckers plans to join the league after completing her career at UConn. The league's goal is to keep WNBA players in the U.S. during their off-season, offering them equity stakes and salaries of at least six figures.

The league will feature 30 players, with six teams competing in 3-on-3 full-court games. Notable players include Stewart, Collier, and Chelsea Gray. Investors range from UConn's coach Geno Auriemma to actor Ashton Kutcher.

This venture represents a significant shift towards athlete empowerment and financial involvement in professional sports.
