Katie Ledecky, 27, won her fourth Olympic gold in the 1500m freestyle, setting a new Olympic record at 15:30.02. This victory ties her with Jenny Thompson for the most women's swimming golds at eight. Ledecky holds the 20 fastest times in this event's history, with her best time surpassing the next fastest by 18 seconds.

Ledecky's dominance in the 1500m, an event added to the Olympics only three years ago, has been unchallenged. Her performance in Paris was another example of her commanding lead, often finishing races with significant margins ahead of her competitors.

In the same night, Torri Huske secured her third medal at the Paris Games, taking silver in the 100m freestyle. Sweden's Sarah Sjöström won gold, becoming the second-oldest woman to claim an individual Olympic swimming gold at 30.

Ledecky's achievements are not just about speed and endurance; they reflect a mastery of technique and mental fortitude, traits that define true greatness in any field.
