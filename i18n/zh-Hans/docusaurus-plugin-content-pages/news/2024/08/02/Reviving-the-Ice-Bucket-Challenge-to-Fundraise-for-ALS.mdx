ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease, is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder causing paralysis. No cure exists.

In 2014, the Ice Bucket Challenge went viral, raising awareness and funds. Pete Frates and Pat Quinn, both with ALS, led the campaign. They're gone now, but their legacy lives on.

Ten years later, at Fenway Park, the challenge re-emerged. Dozens, including Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey and sports stars, poured ice water over themselves. The event aimed to reignite interest and support for ALS research.

So far, the campaign has raised $250 million and spurred an additional $1 billion in research funding. More drugs are now available to treat the disease.

Nancy Frates, Pete's mother, spoke at the event. She remembered her son's determination and the movement he started. "The job isn't done," she quoted him saying.

Dr. Merit Cudkowicz, an ALS specialist, praised the challenge's impact. "It changed how we think about ALS," she said.

Mike Cunningham, diagnosed with ALS last year, attended the event. He found hope and kindness among the participants. "People are good," he noted.

The challenge began with Chris Kennedy, who dared his wife's cousin to take part. From there, it spread like wildfire, involving thousands, including celebrities and politicians.

The Ice Bucket Challenge remains a powerful reminder of collective action and hope in the face of a devastating disease.
