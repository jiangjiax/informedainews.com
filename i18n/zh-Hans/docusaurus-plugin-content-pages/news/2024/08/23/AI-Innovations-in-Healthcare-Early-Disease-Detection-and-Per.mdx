AI is reshaping health care. Google's HeAR project uses AI to analyze coughs and breaths, aiming to detect tuberculosis early. Trained on 300 million audio clips, HeAR can spot disease signs and adapt to various tasks with less data and lower costs.

In India, Salcit Technologies uses HeAR in their Swaasa product to assess lung health from cough sounds, aiding in early TB detection.

For breast cancer, AI enhances ultrasound scans, making them more accessible and accurate, especially in areas with limited medical resources. Google's collaboration with Taiwan's Chang Gung Memorial Hospital shows promise in early cancer detection through ultrasound images.

Australia's Future Hearing Initiative leverages AI to improve hearing aids, offering personalized sound adjustments, better noise filtering, and more natural sound quality. Google partners with Cochlear and the Australian National Acoustics Laboratory to develop advanced hearing devices.

These innovations highlight AI's potential to improve disease detection, expand medical access, and enhance quality of life.
