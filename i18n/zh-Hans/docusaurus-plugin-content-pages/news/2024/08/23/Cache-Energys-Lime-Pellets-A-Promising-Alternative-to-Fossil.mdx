Cache Energy's new technology stores renewable power in lime pellets. These pellets, made from limestone, function like batteries, storing energy by heating up and releasing it as heat when needed. The process is simple, efficient, and inexpensive.

Founder Armpit Dwivedi refers to it as "coal without consequences." The pellets can be stored anywhere, even under a tarp, and are easy to move, utilizing existing infrastructure. Cache's system has the potential to replace fossil fuels for heating homes and industries.

The startup utilizes calcium hydroxide, a common material, to create the pellets. They have optimized the size for optimal energy storage and release. The pellets can generate heat up to 550 degrees Celsius, meeting most heating requirements.

Cache recently secured $8.5 million in funding. Their goal is to maintain low costs and compete with fossil fuels. The technology can be charged in sunny, windy locations and shipped across the country. It represents a promising step towards decarbonizing heat, a significant use of fossil fuels.
