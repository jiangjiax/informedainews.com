Mpox outbreak in Africa, declared a global emergency by WHO, sparks online disinformation.

False claims link mpox to shingles and COVID vaccines. Mpox, identified in the 1970s, is a poxvirus, distinct from shingles, a herpes virus. Symptoms differ.

Mpox transmission isn't limited by sexual orientation. Close, skin-to-skin contact spreads the virus, not sexual preference.

Conspiracy theories claim a miracle cure exists but isn't marketed. Tranilast, suggested for mpox, was only approved for asthma in Japan and China. No human trials for mpox.

WHO hasn't ordered lockdowns for mpox. Countries decide their health measures.

Disinformation complicates public health responses. Clear, factual communication is crucial.
