South Korea conducted a nationwide drill on August 22, preparing for potential nuclear or chemical attacks from North Korea. This exercise, the second of its kind in 2023, involved evacuating civilians to designated shelters such as subway stations and underground parking lots.

In Seoul, at a government building housing 2,200 employees, a siren signaled a rapid descent to the basement. Within ten minutes, the space was filled with people. Soldiers were on hand to guide participants on using gas masks and radiation detectors.

The government distributed pamphlets outlining protection methods for various attack scenarios, emphasizing the importance of sheltering underground or in concrete buildings during a nuclear strike.

North Korea, with its 2022 law on nuclear weapon use and ongoing development of tactical nukes, presents a significant threat. Seoul estimates Pyongyang has up to 5,000 tonnes of chemical weapons.

The drills are designed to protect lives and property, encouraging public participation. Over 17,000 evacuation shelters are listed online.
