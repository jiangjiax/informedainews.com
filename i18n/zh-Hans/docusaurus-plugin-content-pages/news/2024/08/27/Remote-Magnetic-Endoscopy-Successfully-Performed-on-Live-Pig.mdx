Researchers in Zurich, utilizing magnets, conducted an endoscopy on a live pig in Hong Kong. This remote procedure represents a significant advancement in medical technology, enabling doctors to examine internal organs from a distance.

Endoscopy usually necessitates a direct approach, involving the insertion of a flexible tube equipped with a light and camera into the body. The Zurich team replaced this with magnetic control, guiding the endoscope through the pig's digestive tract remotely.

This innovation has the potential to revolutionize surgery by reducing risks and invasiveness. It could allow doctors to perform operations in locations where physical presence is either impossible or impractical.

The implications are extensive. Remote surgeries could be carried out in war zones, during natural disasters, or even in space. This technology not only expands the frontiers of medical practice but also challenges our conventional ideas about proximity and intervention in healthcare.
