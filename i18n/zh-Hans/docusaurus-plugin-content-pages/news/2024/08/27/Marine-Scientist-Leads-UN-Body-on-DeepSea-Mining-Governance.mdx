Leticia Carvalho, a Brazilian marine scientist, will lead the International Seabed Authority (ISA) starting in 2025. She is the first woman, oceanographer, and Latin American to hold this role. The ISA, a UN body, manages deep-sea mining, covering 54% of the world's oceans.

Deep-sea mining involves extracting minerals like cobalt and nickel from seabed nodules. These minerals are crucial for electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies. However, environmentalists warn of irreversible damage to marine ecosystems.

Carvalho emphasizes the need for a clear mining code before any extraction begins. She aims to rebuild trust and ensure transparency within the ISA. Her focus is on governance and environmental protection.

Recent studies, such as the discovery of "dark oxygen" production deep in the ocean, highlight the unknown impacts of mining. Over 30 countries now support a moratorium on deep-sea mining, urging caution.

Carvalho welcomes the debate, seeing it as essential for the ISA's future. She believes environmental safeguards must be part of the mining code, ensuring protection of the deep ocean.
