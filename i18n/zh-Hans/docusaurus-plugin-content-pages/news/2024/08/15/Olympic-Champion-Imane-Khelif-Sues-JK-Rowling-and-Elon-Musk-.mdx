Olympic boxing champion Imane Khelif has filed a lawsuit in France, accusing J.K. Rowling, Elon Musk, and potentially Donald Trump of cyberbullying. Khelif, Algeria’s first gold medalist in women’s boxing, faced gender controversy during her Olympic run.

Khelif was banned from the 2023 boxing world championships for failing a gender test but was cleared by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the Paris Olympics. The IOC disputed the test and removed the International Boxing Association (IBA) as boxing’s governing body.

Khelif, born female, never identified as transgender or intersex. The IOC confirmed her eligibility, stating “scientifically, this is not a man fighting a woman.”

Rowling and Musk amplified the controversy on social media. Rowling criticized the situation as male violence against women in sports. Musk supported the exclusion of men from women’s sports.

Khelif’s attorney, Nabil Boudi, filed a criminal complaint for cyber-harassment, targeting unknown persons and high-profile figures. The lawsuit aims to investigate all involved, regardless of pseudonyms or fame.

Khelif and her coach, Pedro Diaz, described the bullying as deeply affecting her and her team. Despite the harassment, Khelif emphasized her qualification and womanhood, calling her detractors “enemies of success.”
