Starbucks and Chipotle attracted analyst attention following leadership changes. Starbucks shares increased while Chipotle's declined. Analysts view Chipotle as a buying opportunity despite CEO Brian Niccol's transition to Starbucks.

Morgan Stanley downgraded Intuit, highlighting risks associated with pricing strategies and recent acquisitions. Intuit shares have only risen by 3.3% this year.

Bernstein reduced Chipotle's price target but sees a 35% potential upside. Analyst Danilo Gargiulo maintains that Chipotle's fundamentals are robust despite short-term volatility.

Several analysts upgraded Starbucks after the CEO change. Stifel, Deutsche Bank, and Evercore ISI increased their ratings and price targets, anticipating enhanced strategy and execution under Niccol.

In summary, Starbucks benefits from new leadership, whereas Chipotle presents a buying opportunity despite a temporary setback. Intuit confronts challenges due to its shift in growth strategy.
