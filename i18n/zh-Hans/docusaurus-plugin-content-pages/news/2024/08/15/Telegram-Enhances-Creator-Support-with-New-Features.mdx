Telegram celebrates its 11th anniversary with new features aimed at supporting content creators and enhancing user experience.

**Star Reactions:** Users can now send Telegram Stars to support favorite channels, with creators receiving 100% of these stars. These can be converted into Toncoin or used for subsidized ads.

**Star Subscriptions:** Creators can set up paid channels, offering exclusive content or early access in exchange for monthly payments in Telegram Stars.

**Paid Media for Bots:** Channel owners can monetize through paid posts, now extended to bot admins and Telegram Business accounts.

**Super Channels:** Admins can post as their personal profiles or other channels, enhancing the flexibility and personalization of channel content.

**Document Viewer on iOS:** Improved handling of document files, allowing easier switching between files and messages.

Telegram continues to innovate, focusing on community support and creator empowerment. The platform's growth and features reflect a commitment to user engagement and sustainable content creation.
