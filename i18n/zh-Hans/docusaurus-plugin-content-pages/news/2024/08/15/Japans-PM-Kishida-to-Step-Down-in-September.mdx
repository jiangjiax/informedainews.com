Kishida, Japan's PM, withdraws from the LDP presidency race in September. Low approval ratings and a funding scandal compelled his decision. A new leader for the world's fourth-largest economy is set to emerge. Potential successors include Shigeru Ishiba, Taro Kono, and possibly Japan's first female PM. The new leader will face international uncertainty, the US election, and domestic cost crises.
