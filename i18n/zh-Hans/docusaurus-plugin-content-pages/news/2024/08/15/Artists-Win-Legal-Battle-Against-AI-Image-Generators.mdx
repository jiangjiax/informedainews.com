Artists scored a significant victory in court as Judge William Orrick rejected motions to dismiss filed by Stability AI, Midjourney, Runway AI, and DeviantArt. This decision allows artists to pursue investigations into whether these companies infringed on copyright laws by utilizing their work to train AI without consent.

Stable Diffusion, an AI model capable of generating images, and datasets similar to LAION, which gather art for AI training purposes, may now be subject to copyright infringement charges.

Attorneys Joseph Saveri and Matthew Butterick view this ruling as a substantial advancement in protecting artists' rights.
