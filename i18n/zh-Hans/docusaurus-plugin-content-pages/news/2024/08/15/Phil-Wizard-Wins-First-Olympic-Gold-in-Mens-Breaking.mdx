Philip Kim, known as B-Boy Phil Wizard, won the first Olympic gold in men's breaking at the Paris Games. Breaking, a dance style blending dance, gymnastics, and acrobatics, originated in 1970s New York.

Kim's victory introduced the world to breaking's culture of peace, love, and unity. His former coach, Jheric Hizon, mentored Kim from age 10, guiding his journey from Vancouver to the global stage.

Breaking made its Olympic debut in Paris, though its future in the Games is uncertain. Anita Perel-Panar, co-founder of Boogaloo Academy, believes Kim's win will sustain the sport's vibrancy.

Kim aims to use breaking to improve mental health and inspire positive change. Hizon highlights the supportive community in Vancouver, emphasizing collaboration and mutual encouragement.

Kim's success has sparked interest in breaking, potentially drawing more youth into the sport. His unique approach to choreography, combining familiar moves into innovative sequences, sets him apart.

Hizon now focuses on imparting life lessons to Kim, reflecting on their journey together.
