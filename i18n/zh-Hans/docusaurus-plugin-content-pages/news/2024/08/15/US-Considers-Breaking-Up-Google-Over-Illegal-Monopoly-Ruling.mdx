A US judge has ruled that Google's search monopoly is illegal. The Justice Department is considering breaking up Alphabetâ€™s Google, which is valued at $2 trillion. Potential actions include divesting Android, selling AdWords, and Chrome. Google intends to appeal.

Antitrust laws are designed to prevent monopolies and ensure fair competition. In 2021, Google spent over $26 billion to maintain its default status on Safari, thereby suppressing competition. This ruling represents a significant victory in the fight against the market dominance of big tech companies.
