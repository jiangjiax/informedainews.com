Ukrainian drones have struck Russian airbases in Voronezh, Kursk, Savasleyka, and Borisoglebsk, which are known to launch warplanes that bomb Ukraine. Ukraine claims to have shot down a Russian Su-34 and captured 100 Russian soldiers in Kursk.

Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko is working to establish a buffer zone in Kursk to protect border communities from Russian attacks. The Belgorod region in Russia is also under emergency status due to Ukrainian strikes.

Ukraine’s long-term plans in Kursk are unclear. The longer the incursion continues, the more challenging it becomes for Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Russian elite are closely observing whether he can maintain control.

Ukraine is offering humanitarian corridors for civilians to evacuate to both Russia and Ukraine. International aid groups, including the Red Cross and the UN, will have access.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is discussing the humanitarian situation and plans for a military commandant’s office in occupied areas. Ukraine controls the Russian town of Sudzha, a key gas transit hub, but has no plans to claim Russian land.

The rouble continues to decline against the dollar since the incursion began.

Intense fighting continues in Ukraine’s Donetsk region. Zelenskiy promises additional weapons from Western support.

Russian drones attacked a medical vehicle in Kharkiv, resulting in the death of a medic and injuries to others. A Russian ballistic missile struck Odesa’s port infrastructure, injuring a port worker and a grain carrier driver.

China’s special envoy has discussed the war with Pope Francis’s peace envoy. Mali’s Tuareg rebels deny receiving help from Ukraine in recent clashes with Russian Wagner mercenaries.
