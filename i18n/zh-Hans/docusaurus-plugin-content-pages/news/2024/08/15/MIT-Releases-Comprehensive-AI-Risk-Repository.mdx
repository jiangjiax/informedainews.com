MIT researchers have compiled a database of AI risks, aiming to guide policymakers and industry stakeholders. The repository, dubbed an "AI risk repository," catalogs over 700 risks, categorized by factors like intentionality and domains such as discrimination.

Peter Slattery, lead researcher, highlights the repository's purpose: to provide a comprehensive, accessible database that updates over time. Existing risk frameworks often overlook significant risks, with some covering as little as 20% of identified subdomains.

The repository, developed in collaboration with multiple institutions, includes risks often neglected in other frameworks, such as AI-generated spam and pollution of the information ecosystem.

Slattery emphasizes the repository's potential to streamline risk assessment, saving time and enhancing oversight. However, its impact on actual regulation remains uncertain. The MIT team plans to use the repository to evaluate how well different risks are being addressed, aiming to identify and rectify gaps in organizational responses.
