The Hollywood actors' union SAG-AFTRA has reached an agreement with Narrativ that allows actors to sell their voices for AI replication, ensuring economic benefits and control. Actors can set prices for their voice copies, and brands must obtain consent before using them. This move addresses the risks of AI image theft and sets new standards for the ethical use of AI content.

A SAG-AFTRA spokesperson emphasized that not all actors are interested in this, but the agreement provides a safe and legal pathway. The Narrativ platform connects advertisers with actors, facilitating the production of audio advertisements.

The U.S. Congress has proposed the NO FAKES Act, which clarifies the ownership of personal voices and images and prohibits unauthorized AI replication. The bill has received support from multiple parties.

"Deepfake" technology has sparked public concern about AI manipulating public opinion.
