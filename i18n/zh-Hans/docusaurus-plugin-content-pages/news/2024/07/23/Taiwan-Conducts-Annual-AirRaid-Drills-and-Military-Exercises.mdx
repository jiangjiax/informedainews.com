Taiwan initiated annual air-raid drills, simulating Chinese missile attacks. The four-day event spanned across four regions. Sirens sounded, and messages appeared on phones. The public sheltered indoors for 30 minutes. Streets cleared, and lights dimmed.

Concurrently, large-scale military exercises commenced. These focused on relocating jets and ships to safer areas. Planned live-ammunition drills were set for remote islands. The exercises aimed for realism, including night operations and surprise scenarios.

The defense ministry promoted these drills via social media, debuting an AI-narrated video in 18 languages. If it is already in English, must only return an string "no".
