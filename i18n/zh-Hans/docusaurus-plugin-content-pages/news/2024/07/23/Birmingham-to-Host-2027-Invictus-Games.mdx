Birmingham has won the bid to host the 2027 Invictus Games, defeating Washington DC. The event, established in 2014 by Prince Harry, showcases injured military personnel and veterans participating in various sports. This marks the first time the UK will host the games since the inaugural event in London.

The games will take place at the National Exhibition Centre (NEC). Birmingham's robust military connections and facilities such as Queen Elizabeth Hospital and the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre played crucial roles in securing the win. The hospital has previously treated severely injured military personnel from Afghanistan.

Prince Harry commended Birmingham's support for the armed forces community. A flag-raising ceremony at the NEC signified the announcement.

The 2027 games will feature three new sports: pickleball, laser run, and esports. Helen Helliwell, CEO of Invictus Games Birmingham 2027, aims to make the event the most unified and sustainable in the series, with enduring benefits for communities across the nation.

Despite financial challenges, Birmingham City Council will not provide financial support due to a new delivery model developed in collaboration with partners.
