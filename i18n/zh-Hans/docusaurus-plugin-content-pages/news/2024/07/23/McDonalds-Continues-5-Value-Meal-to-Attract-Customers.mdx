McDonald's is extending its $5 meal deal. Almost all U.S. locations have voted to continue it. The deal includes a McChicken, fries, and a drink. The goal is to bring customers back and keep them from going to competitors. Restaurants are facing tough competition, so they are offering discounts to attract diners who are looking for good value. McDonald's hopes this will increase customer traffic and growth.
