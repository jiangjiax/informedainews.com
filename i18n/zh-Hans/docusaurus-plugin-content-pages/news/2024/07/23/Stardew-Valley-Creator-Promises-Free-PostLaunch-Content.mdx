Eric 'Concerned Ape' Barone, the creator of Stardew Valley, has pledged to keep all post-launch content free. He is currently focused on the 1.6 update, with the goal of expanding the farming simulation game across consoles and mobile platforms.

DLC, or Downloadable Content, usually refers to additional features or storylines that are sold separately after a game's initial release. Barone's commitment ensures that fans can enjoy his games without incurring extra costs.
