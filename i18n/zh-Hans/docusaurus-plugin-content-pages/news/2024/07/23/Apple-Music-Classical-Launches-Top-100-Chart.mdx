Apple launched its Classical app 16 months ago. Now, it debuts a Top 100 chart, updated weekly. This chart, sourced from streams, downloads, and tags across 165 countries, claims to be the most comprehensive. The inaugural top spot goes to Bach's "Keyboard Concertos," performed by Tianqi Du. The app, separate from main Apple Music, requires a subscription.
