Wildfires rage in British Columbia, Canada. Over 300 fires burn, half out of control. Thousands brace for evacuation. Hot, dry weather complicates firefighting. A three-week heatwave persists.

Firefighters from across Canada, New Zealand, and Australia battle the flames. Lightning strikes fuel nearly 90% of the fires. Despite challenges, this season lags behind 2023's record devastation.

In Alberta, smoke from over 150 fires chokes major cities. Air quality alerts issued. 7,500 people evacuate. Nationwide, nearly 900 fires burn, with 352 uncontained.

The situation mirrors a broader struggle against climate extremes. Each fire season tests resilience and underscores the urgent need for climate action.
