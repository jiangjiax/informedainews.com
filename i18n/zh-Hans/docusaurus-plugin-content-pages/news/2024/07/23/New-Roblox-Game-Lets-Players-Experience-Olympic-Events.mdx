A new Roblox game, "The Team USA Ultimate Obby," allows U.S. players to immerse themselves in Olympic and Paralympic events. It features athlete avatars, video highlights, and a themed obstacle course. Players can purchase Games-themed gear and an emote inspired by Olympians Sunny Choi and Victor Montalvo.

In the game, players can track medal counts, relax in the digital Team USA House, or attempt commentary in the Peacock Fan Zone with Mike Tirico. The main challenge is a speed-running obstacle course, narrated by Tirico, where you transform into various athletes.

Additionally, there's a scavenger hunt to save the Team USA Museum and a shop where you can buy Team USA gear and support breaking athletes. A portal also leads to an Olympic-themed experience with unique gear and mini-games.

The game is now live at TeamUSA.com/Roblox or NBCOlympics.com/Roblox.
