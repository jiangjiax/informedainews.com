Birmingham has won the bid to host the 2027 Invictus Games, defeating Washington DC. The event, established in 2014 by Prince Harry, showcases injured military personnel and veterans participating in various sports. This marks the first time the UK will host the games since their inception in London.

The games will take place at the National Exhibition Centre (NEC). Birmingham's robust military connections and facilities such as the Queen Elizabeth Hospital and the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre played crucial roles in securing the win. The hospital has previously treated severely injured military personnel from Afghanistan.

Prince Harry commended Birmingham's support for the armed forces community. A flag-raising ceremony at the NEC signified the announcement.

The 2027 games will introduce three new sports: pickleball, laser run, and esports. Helen Helliwell, CEO of Invictus Games Birmingham 2027, aims to make the event the most cohesive and sustainable in the series, with enduring benefits for communities across the nation.

The Invictus Games have grown internationally, with the next event scheduled for Vancouver and Whistler in 2025, expecting 550 competitors from up to 25 nations.
