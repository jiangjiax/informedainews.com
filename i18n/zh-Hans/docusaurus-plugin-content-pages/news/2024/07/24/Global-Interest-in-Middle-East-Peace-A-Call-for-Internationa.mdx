Former US Ambassador to the UN, Andrew Young, emphasizes the global interest in Middle East peace. Not just Israel and Palestine, but countries like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran, the US, and Egypt seek resolution. Young, 92, recalls past efforts to unite Israelis and Palestinians during his UN tenure (1977-1979). He advocates for a "no-fault solution," avoiding past conflicts' recriminations.

Young highlights the destructive costs of the ongoing Gaza conflict, where Israeli strikes have killed over 39,000 and injured nearly 90,000. He calls for international action to halt violence and foster a better world.

The upcoming 2024 Paris Olympics, according to Young, offer a platform for peace initiatives, echoing the original Olympic spirit of peacebuilding. His experience includes serving as mayor of Atlanta and co-chair of the 1996 Olympic Games committee.
