Scientists have solved a longstanding issue in material design: the absence of a mathematical foundation for three-dimensional conformal methods. A team led by Professors Qiu Chengwei and Huang Jiping has developed a new technique called Conformality-Assisted Tracing (CAT). This method enables the precise and efficient design of intricate 3D structures, surpassing previous geometric constraints.

CAT operates by utilizing steady-state heat flow to generate a 3D network of lines and surfaces. This grid, which preserves angles and scale, can be employed to design materials that manage heat, light, and other physical properties. The method is forward-looking, focusing on designing materials based on desired outcomes rather than modifying existing ones.

This advancement could transform areas such as military stealth technology and industrial applications. The team is now exploring the expansion of CAT's applications to fluid dynamics and elasticity, with the goal of addressing challenges like chip cooling and aircraft insulation.

The name CAT is a whimsical allusion to the method's tracking capabilities, akin to a cat pursuing its target. This innovation not only resolves a significant scientific hurdle but also opens new pathways for material science and engineering.
