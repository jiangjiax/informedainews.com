Adobe has introduced new AI tools, Firefly, for Photoshop and Illustrator. These tools enable designers to describe what they want, and AI swiftly generates textures or images. Adobe trained Firefly on creative work and compensated the contributors. They provide free generative credits to Creative Cloud users.

Illustrator's new "Generative Shape Fill" tool, currently in beta, adds details and textures through text prompts. Photoshop now widely offers text-to-image generation. Adobe has observed customers upgrading to higher-priced plans for more credits. Since March, Firefly has created over 9 billion images.

Illustrator also received non-AI updates: a Dimension Tool for measuring, a Mockup tool for logo placement, and Retype for font recognition. Photoshop introduced new brush tools to simplify tasks.

Adobe maintains a balance between innovation and user concerns, ensuring that the tools enhance rather than replace creative work.
