Temu, the cross-border e-commerce platform under Pinduoduo, has surpassed its sales target for the first half of the year, achieving over $20 billion in sales, far exceeding the annual goal of $18 billion. This growth rate has outpaced its competitors, SHEIN and TikTok, which took nine and three years respectively to reach $20 billion in sales.

Temu's expansion strategy has transitioned from a "full consignment" to a "semi-consignment" model. Under the "semi-consignment" model, sellers are responsible for logistics, whereas the "full consignment" model was managed by Temu. This change has expanded the variety of products and reduced costs.

The platform has benefited from the U.S. "de minimis" rule, which exempts import duties on goods under $800. However, with potential policy changes under the Trump administration, Temu is diversifying its market focus, planning to reduce its U.S. sales ratio from 60% to 30%.

Temu is also expanding its "semi-consignment" model globally, starting with Europe, following initial success in the U.S. This model targets Amazon sellers with mature logistics capabilities, providing them with a platform to clear inventory.

Competition with Amazon is intensifying, as Amazon has launched a "low-price store" similar to Temu's "full consignment". This move not only directly competes with Temu but also exacerbates the tension in international shipping resources, potentially leading to increased costs.

Temu's strategy to expand its "semi-consignment" model is crucial for its continued growth and adaptation to market and policy changes.
