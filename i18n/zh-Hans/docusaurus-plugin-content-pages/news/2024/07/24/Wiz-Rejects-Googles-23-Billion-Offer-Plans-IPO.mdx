Wiz, a cloud security startup, has turned down a $23 billion buyout offer from Google. Instead, Wiz plans to go public, aiming for a $1 billion annual revenue. The decision reflects antitrust and investor concerns.

Founded in 2020, Wiz quickly reached $100 million in annual revenue within 18 months and $350 million in 2023. Backed by major investors like Sequoia and Index Ventures, Wiz specializes in cloud security, a critical area as more companies move operations online.

Google, keen to bolster its cloud services against rivals like Microsoft and Amazon, has faced setbacks in acquisitions, including the recent collapse of talks to buy HubSpot. Wiz's rejection marks a significant departure from typical tech acquisition trends, highlighting the startup's confidence and market potential.
