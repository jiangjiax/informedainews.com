Canada's health care system is under strain due to complex patient needs and a shortage of doctors. Six million Canadians do not have a family physician. Emergency rooms are overwhelmed, and wait times for surgeries are increasing.

Dr. Kathleen Ross, president of the Canadian Medical Association (CMA), advocates for team-based care. Her clinic refers patients to counselors and dietitians to address various health needs. British Columbia funds six counseling sessions, while dietitian services are limited and specific to certain conditions.

High demand forces patients to seek care at crowded walk-in clinics and emergency rooms, which lack comprehensive follow-up care. Long waits for MRIs and surgeries have led provinces to expand private surgical centers and virtual care options. Quebec plans to restrict private nursing agencies.

The CMA proposes a combination of public and private funding, with equity in care being a priority. Goals include expanding interprofessional primary care teams to serve half of Canadians within five years. The CMA opposes user fees for publicly insured primary care.

Dr. Danielle Martin supports broader access to team-based care, highlighting the role of physiotherapists in managing conditions such as lower-back pain. She emphasizes the importance of reducing wait times, which is crucial for aging Canadians needing complex care.

Norma Luks appreciates the comprehensive care provided by her family health team, contrasting it with the challenges of solo practice. Despite these advantages, her team is not accepting new patients.

The CMA is seeking further consultation to refine its recommendations, aiming for a finalization by fall.
