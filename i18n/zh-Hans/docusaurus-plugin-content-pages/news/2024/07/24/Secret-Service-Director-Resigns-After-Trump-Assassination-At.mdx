Kimberly Cheatle, US Secret Service director, resigned after a failed assassination attempt on Donald Trump. The incident, deemed the agency's "most significant operational failure" in decades, occurred at a Pennsylvania rally. Cheatle took full responsibility but faced criticism for not answering specific questions about the security lapse.

The 20-year-old assailant evaded security and opened fire from a nearby roof, injuring Trump and others. The attack shocked the nation amid heightened political tensions.

In her resignation letter, Cheatle acknowledged the security failure and emphasized the Secret Service's ongoing mission. President Joe Biden accepted her resignation, praising her integrity. An independent review is underway to prevent future incidents.

Trump, on his Truth Social network, blamed the Biden administration for the security breach. Cheatle's resignation followed demands from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, who questioned her ability to lead after the hearing.
