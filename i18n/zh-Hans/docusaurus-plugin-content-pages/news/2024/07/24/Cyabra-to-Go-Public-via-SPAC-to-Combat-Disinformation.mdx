Cyabra, a Tel Aviv startup, plans to go public via a SPAC. They detect fake social media accounts for clients like Warner Media and governments. The deal values Cyabra at $70 million.

SPACs, once popular, are now less common due to new SEC rules. Cyabra, however, sees potential in this route. They've worked with 19 governments in the past year, focusing on election security.

Their tech, developed by former Israeli special forces, uses algorithms to spot bot activity. This helps clients manage brand reputation and identify real influencers.

Elon Musk used Cyabra before buying Twitter. Dan Brahmy, Cyabra's CEO, emphasizes their role in combating disinformation.

Mike Pompeo, former CIA director, joined Cyabra's board. He views the company as vital in the fight against false narratives and AI manipulation.

In short, Cyabra aims to protect democracy and national security by exposing fake online accounts and misleading content. Their upcoming public listing via a SPAC marks a significant step in their mission.
