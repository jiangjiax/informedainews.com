New research from Singapore indicates that consuming more fruit reduces the risk of depression in older adults. The study followed 13,738 individuals over a period of 20 years. Participants who consumed three or more servings of fruit daily experienced a 21% lower incidence of depression. Common fruits included apples, bananas, and oranges. There was no notable difference between fruits with high and low glycemic indexes. The beneficial effects are likely due to the antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds present in fruit. Vegetables did not exhibit a similar correlation. This study corroborates earlier findings from Japan and Australia. Further research is required to fully understand the mechanisms by which fruit aids in reducing depression. The findings were published in the Journal of Nutrition, Health, and Aging.
