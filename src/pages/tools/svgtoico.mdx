# FAQs

## What is an SVG file?

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a vector image file format composed of points, lines, curves, and polygons. These graphical elements are described by lines of code that a vector image reader can interpret and render as images on a display. One major advantage of SVG is that the image can be resized without distortion.

## What is an ICO file?

ICO is a raster image format primarily used for computer icons. Each ICO file contains one or more icon images, each made up of a grid of pixels, with each pixel representing a color. This makes ICO files very flexible for displaying icons of different sizes, especially for various application icons in the Windows operating system.

## Why Convert SVG to ICO?

There are several reasons to convert SVG to ICO:

Creating application icons: The ICO format is the standard for creating application icons, used by almost all operating systems and applications.

Compatibility: Many icon editors and design tools cannot directly handle SVG files. Converting SVG to ICO makes it easier to use these tools. Additionally, ICO files are widely supported in most web browsers and desktop environments, while SVG files may not display correctly in some cases.

## Is Converting SVG to ICO Safe?

Yes, our conversion tool is completely safe and reliable. We do not collect any personal information or save your uploaded files. All uploaded and converted files are automatically deleted from the server after 60 minutes. When you upload an SVG file, our server creates a copy for conversion, while your original SVG file remains securely stored on your computer or mobile device. If you are not satisfied with the conversion results, you can always re-convert the original SVG file.

## Can I Convert Multiple SVG Files at Once?

Yes, you can upload and convert multiple SVG files at once. If you have many files to convert, you can repeat the upload and conversion process multiple times. After conversion, you can click the "Download All" button to download a ZIP archive containing all ICO files, saving you a lot of time.

## How Long Are My Converted Files Stored?

To protect your privacy and security, all uploaded and converted files are automatically deleted from the server after 60 minutes. We do not save or back up these files, so please ensure you download your ICO files within this timeframe.

## How Do You Ensure My Files Are Secure?

During the conversion process, your files are secure. We use a secure server to handle file conversion and do not save or share your file content. The uploaded SVG files are automatically deleted after conversion, ensuring your files and data privacy are protected.
