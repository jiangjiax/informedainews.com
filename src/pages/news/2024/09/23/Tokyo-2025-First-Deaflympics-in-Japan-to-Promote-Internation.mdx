TOKYO â€” The Deaflympics, set to debut in Tokyo in 2025, marks a historic first for Japan. This event, distinct from the Paralympics, brings together deaf athletes from around the world. The games, spanning 12 days, will feature 3,000 athletes competing in 21 sports.

The Deaflympics foster international exchange, transcending differences in sign languages. International Sign Language (ISL) serves as a common tongue, much like English in spoken communication. However, regional sign languages, such as Japanese Sign Language (JSL) and American Sign Language (ASL), vary significantly.

Clubs like Tampopo in Tokyo are preparing for the event by teaching ISL. Members, including those who can hear, are eager to connect with international participants. The diversity in sign languages highlights the unique challenges and opportunities in deaf communication.

Digital technology is also bridging gaps. Smartphones and IT infrastructure are making global communication easier for deaf individuals. The Deaflympics in Tokyo could be a catalyst for greater international understanding and connection among deaf communities.
