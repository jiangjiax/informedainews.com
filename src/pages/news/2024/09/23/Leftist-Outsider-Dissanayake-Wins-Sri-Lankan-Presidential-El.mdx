Anura Kumara Dissanayake, a leftist outsider, won Sri Lanka's presidential election, marking a seismic shift in the nation's political landscape. Dissanayake, 55, led the National Peopleâ€™s Power (NPP) alliance, which has never held power. His victory reflects public anger over corruption and economic hardship, sparked by a 2022 crisis.

Dissanayake pledged to renegotiate IMF bailout terms to ease the burden on impoverished Sri Lankans. His win contrasts sharply with previous poor showings; in 2019, he garnered just 3% of the vote.

The election saw a second-round runoff, a first in Sri Lanka's history. Dissanayake secured 42.31% in the first round, leading to a final count against Sajith Premadasa, the parliamentary opposition leader.

The campaign was notably peaceful, a departure from past violence. Dissanayake's success stems from the NPP's long-term strategy to tap into antiestablishment sentiment. Analysts credit his win to grassroots organizing and a novel political blueprint.

Dissanayake's victory underscores a broader trend of antiestablishment forces gaining traction globally. His rise from humble beginnings to the presidency symbolizes a profound shift in Sri Lankan's political dynamics.
