The Pokemon Company aims to strengthen its presence in Indonesia, a country with 60 million young people and a growing economy. Despite having been present for 20 years, its popularity still trails behind that in Japan and the U.S.

Mana Wakiyama, a representative from The Pokemon Company, highlighted this gap during the finale of Pikachu’s Indonesia Journey in Jakarta. The tour, which also included stops in Surabaya, Yogyakarta, and Bali, attracted 30,000 fans. Pikachu was dressed in batik, a nod to local culture.

The company plans to further localize its products, beginning with the mobile game Pokemon Go and trading cards. The Bali event alone generated $13.6 million, including $1.4 million in taxes.

Indonesian fans are enthusiastic about these efforts. Fauzan Ilhami, a 21-year-old college student, hopes for more localized merchandise and a Pokemon Center in Indonesia, which would reduce the need to travel abroad for official products.

The Pokemon franchise started as a 1996 computer game, expanding into cartoons and merchandise. It is now one of Japan’s top intellectual properties, initially gaining popularity in Indonesia through cartoons.
