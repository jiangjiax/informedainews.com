Craft and sparkling sake are revitalizing Japan's traditional rice wine culture. Sendai Station Brewery Fermenteria offers Sake Baby, a fizzy, yogurt-like drink with 5% alcohol, appealing to younger tastes. Shokagura, the brewer, plans to expand its sales to more restaurants.

Ichinokura's Suzune, a pioneering sparkling sake, has gained international acclaim, including a premium version, Suzune Wabi. Takara Shuzo's Mio, Japan's top-selling sparkling sake, attracts younger consumers, especially women.

Despite overall sake shipment declines, craft sake, which uses traditional techniques with varied ingredients, thrives without export-only restrictions. Kakuyasu Group promotes sake-and-soda cocktails, replacing beer as a first-course drink in restaurants. This innovation has boosted sake sales by 10% year-on-year.

**Insights:**
The evolution of sake reflects changing consumer preferences and global interest. Craft and sparkling varieties offer a modern twist, making traditional sake more accessible and appealing to younger generations and international markets. This shift underscores the adaptability of traditional industries in the face of modern tastes and global trends.
