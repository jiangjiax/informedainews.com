Japanese artists like XG, Yoasobi, and Creepy Nuts are making global waves with their music, driven by user-generated content (UGC). XG, a hip-hop/R&B girl group, tops international charts with tracks like "SOMETHING AINâ€™T RIGHT" and "WOKE UP." Their English lyrics and dance-focused videos inspire fan creations, boosting their global reach.

Creepy Nuts' "BBBB" became a hit after featuring in the anime "Mashle: Magic and Muscles." The song's popularity surged due to fans mimicking the anime's dance, propelling it to the top of iTunes Hip Hop charts in over 35 countries.

Kocchi no Kento's "Hai Yorokonde" also gained traction through TikTok, with its catchy beat and lyrics inspiring viral dance videos. The song's retro anime-inspired music video further fueled its global appeal.

Billboard JAPAN's "Global Japan Songs Excl. Japan" and "Japan Songs (country-specific chart)" highlight these trends, showing J-pop's growing international influence. The charts reveal that global hits tend to stay on the charts longer, a shift from the CD era to the digital streaming age.

This surge in J-pop's global popularity underscores the power of UGC in modern music, where fan engagement and digital platforms play crucial roles in an artist's success.
