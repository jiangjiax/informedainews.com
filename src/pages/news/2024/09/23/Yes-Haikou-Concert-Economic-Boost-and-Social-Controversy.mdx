American rapper Ye, formerly Kanye West, recently performed in Haikou, China, drawing 42,000 fans and generating 51 million yuan ($7.23 million) in ticket sales. This single show outearned a recent five-show run in the U.S. and Europe, averaging $2.4 million per show.

Ye's concert boosted Haikou's tourism revenue by 373 million yuan, roughly 40% of the city's total during the May Golden Week holiday. Despite his controversial past, including antisemitic remarks and other scandals, Chinese authorities allowed the performance.

Some critics called for a boycott, citing Ye's history of "immoral behavior" and his attendance at the Paris Crazy Horse Show, which led to bans for other artists like Blackpink's Lisa and actress Angelababy.

Despite these controversies, Ye's presence in Haikou sparked widespread interest on social media, with fans sharing his daily activities and purchases. Local businesses, like Miniso and milk tea chain Good Me, saw a surge in popularity.

The announcement of an additional show led to chaos when it was rescheduled, causing frustration among fans who had already booked travel arrangements.
