CNN analysis suggests that the 2024 U.S. presidential election is shaping up to be "the closest race of the century." The competition between Democratic candidate Harris and Republican candidate Trump is exceptionally fierce, with polls showing Harris only slightly ahead, often within the margin of error.

The Electoral College system makes the outcome uncertain. Harris's support has slightly increased after the televised debates, but she is not yet assured of victory. The latest polls show Harris leading Trump by three to five percentage points, far from a level that would guarantee a win.

Since the campaign began, the two candidates have maintained a deadlock, with no candidate ever leading in national polls by at least five percentage points. This situation is quite rare and similar election dynamics may have to be traced back to the 1960s.

The final result will depend on who can secure at least 270 electoral votes. Analysis estimates that Harris needs to win the popular vote by at least three percentage points to have a clear advantage in electoral votes, but she has not yet reached that point.

Currently, Harris is confident of securing 225 electoral votes, while Trump is confident of securing 219. The electoral votes from seven swing states and Nebraska's 2nd congressional district are still up for grabs.

Early in-person voting has already begun in some states, with more states set to follow in mid-October. This closely contested presidential race still holds many uncertainties.
