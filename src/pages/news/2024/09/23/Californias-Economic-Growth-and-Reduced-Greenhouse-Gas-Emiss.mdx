California's economy expanded by 78% from 2000 to 2022, yet greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 20%. In 2022 alone, emissions fell by 2.4%, or 9.3 million metric tonsâ€”equivalent to the emissions of 2.2 million gas-powered cars. The most significant reduction came from the transportation sector, thanks to the increased use of electric cars and renewable fuels.

Emissions from the electricity sector also declined by 4.1%, even as electricity usage increased. Solar and wind power now make up 30% of electricity generation. Battery storage capacity surged by 757% from 2019 to 2023, enough to power 6.6 million homes for four hours.

Industrial emissions reached a 22-year low, dropping by 2%. Livestock emissions, which account for 70% of agriculture's greenhouse gas output, peaked in 2012 and decreased in 2022 due to the use of methane digesters. Methane emissions from landfills also declined, thanks to waste reduction efforts.

Governor Gavin Newsom attributes the progress to California's climate programs. The state aims to continue this trend, with zero-emission vehicles expected to make up a quarter of new car sales in the second quarter of 2024.

**Key Terms:**
- **Methane Digesters:** Systems that capture methane from livestock waste and convert it into clean fuel.
- **Cap-and-Trade Program:** A market-based approach to controlling pollution by providing economic incentives for achieving reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
- **Renewables Portfolio Standard:** A policy that requires utility companies to obtain a minimum percentage of their power from renewable energy sources.
