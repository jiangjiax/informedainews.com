The FTC has just approved a $51,744-per-violation rule aimed at AI-generated articles and fake product reviews. It also bans "product review suppression," where businesses use threats or intimidation to silence negative reviews. Additionally, the rule prohibits companies from paying for specific sentiments in reviews or creating fake independent review sites. FTC's Sam Levine says this levels the playing field for honest businesses, addressing deceptive advertising in the digital age.
