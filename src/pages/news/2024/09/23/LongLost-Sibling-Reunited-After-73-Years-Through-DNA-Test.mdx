In 1951, six-year-old Luis Armando Albino was abducted from a California park. He remained missing for 73 years. Thanks to an online ancestry test, old photos, and newspaper clippings, his niece, Alida Alequin, located him on the U.S. East Coast.

Albino, now a retired firefighter and Marine Corps veteran, was raised by a couple who treated him as their own. His mother never gave up hope, passing away in 2005.

Alequin's DNA test in 2020 showed a 22% match with her uncle. After further investigation, she and her daughters found him in June. Albino met his California family, including his brother Roger, who died in August.

Oakland police acknowledged Alequin's efforts, calling the outcome "what we strive for." Albino prefers privacy but Alequin hopes her story helps other families.

**Key Terms:**
- **Ancestry test:** A DNA test used to trace one's genetic lineage.
- **Microfilm:** A photographic film used to store large amounts of printed or photographed material for easy viewing.
