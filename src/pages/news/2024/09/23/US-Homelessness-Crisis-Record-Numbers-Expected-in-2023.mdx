The U.S. is set to break its homelessness record this year. Preliminary data from over 250 service organizations shows a 10% rise, with around 550,000 people homeless on a single night. This could surpass the 2023 peak of 653,000.

Cities like Boston, San Francisco, and Chicago report significant increases. Chicago saw a 70% migrant homeless population. Texas's migrant busing to cities like Chicago and New York contributed to these numbers.

Home prices have surged 2.4 times faster than inflation since the 1960s. The average U.S. home now costs over $430,000, compared to $177,000 if prices had kept pace with inflation.

The COVID-19 pandemic shifted lifestyles, exacerbating the housing crisis. Ending pandemic aid worsened the situation. Mental health issues and drug use, like fentanyl, also play a role.

In short, soaring housing costs, pandemic shifts, and social issues are driving the homelessness surge. The U.S. faces a stark housing crisis, with no easy solutions in sight.
