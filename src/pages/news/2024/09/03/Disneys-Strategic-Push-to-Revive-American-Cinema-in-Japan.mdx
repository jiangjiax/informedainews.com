Disney aims to reclaim Japan's movie market. Carol Choi, Disney's Asia-Pacific content chief, notes Japan's swift recovery from COVID-19's impact on cinema. In 2023, Japan's box office rose 4% to 221.4 billion yen, with domestic anime dominating.

Historically, foreign films led Japan's box office. Now, Disney plans sequels like "Inside Out 2" and "Mufasa: The Lion King" to attract viewers. Choi emphasizes Disney's legacy and fan loyalty as key advantages.

Disney+ will feature more Japanese content, including anime adaptations and live-action series. Collaboration with Oriental Land, operator of Tokyo DisneySea, enhances Disney's presence in Japan.

Disney's strategy includes leveraging theme parks and cruises, tapping local talent, and expanding Asian content on Disney+. Choi highlights the global appeal of Japanese-themed content, evident in FX's "Shogun" Emmy nominations.
