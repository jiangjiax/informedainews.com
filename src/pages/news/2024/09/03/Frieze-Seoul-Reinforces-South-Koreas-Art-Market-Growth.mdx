Frieze Seoul, an extension of the esteemed Frieze fairs in London, New York, and Los Angeles, makes its return to Seoul for its third edition. The event, hosted at the COEX convention center, anticipates welcoming over 70,000 attendees. It showcases 110 galleries from 32 nations, featuring prominent names such as Gagosian and Pace Gallery.

Pat Lee, the director of Frieze Seoul, highlights the fair's international allure and the discerning nature of its visitors. The event aligns with Seoul Art Week, enhancing the vibrancy of the city's artistic landscape. The South Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism supports these efforts, aiming to cement the nation's position as a pivotal art hub.

The art market in South Korea has experienced substantial expansion, partly attributed to advantageous tax regulations. Major corporations like Samsung and LG have been significant art investors for years, nurturing a thriving collecting culture. A new generation of collectors is emerging, invigorating the market's dynamism.

Frieze Seoul and its associated events affirm Korea's robust art and collecting scene, foreshadowing a promising future for the industry.
