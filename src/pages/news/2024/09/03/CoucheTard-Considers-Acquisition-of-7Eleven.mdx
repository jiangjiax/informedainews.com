Couche-Tard is eyeing 7-Eleven for its inexpensive stock. Portfolio manager Richard Kaye believes there's limited scope for enhancement in 7-Eleven's core operations. The interest arises as 7-Eleven embarks on a global expansion strategy and disposes of underperforming supermarkets.

Kaye is skeptical that a foreign acquisition would lead to significant transformation. 7-Eleven is outstanding in logistics and innovation. He identifies potential in revamping other areas, but these do not impact profitability.

Seven & i's stock is trading at a low price-to-earnings ratio of 27.96 and a price-to-book ratio of 1.47. Despite having fewer stores, Couche-Tard boasts a higher market valuation of $54 billion compared to 7-Eleven's $38.3 billion.

Regulatory challenges are on the horizon, particularly in the U.S. Analysts anticipate divestments to alleviate antitrust issues.

Kaye considers 7-Eleven a compelling buying opportunity. It is more affordable than its global counterparts yet performs admirably.
