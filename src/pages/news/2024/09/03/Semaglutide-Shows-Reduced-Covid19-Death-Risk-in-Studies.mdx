People on semaglutide, a key component of Ozempic and Wegovy, had a 33% lower risk of dying from Covid-19, according to studies in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. Semaglutide, manufactured by Novo Nordisk, also demonstrated benefits for heart and kidney health, and reduced deaths from non-heart causes by 29%.

The drug appears to enhance overall health, with weight loss almost as a side effect. Benjamin Scirica, a study co-author, noted that weight was not a major factor in these benefits. The research involved over 17,600 overweight or obese individuals with heart issues, but not diabetes.

Novo Nordisk, now Europe's most valuable company, faces competition from Eli Lilly and others in the weight loss market. Yale's Harlan Krumholz suggests that semaglutide might work through multiple health-promoting mechanisms, but more research is needed.

Not all news is positive: Harvard found that weight loss drugs might increase the risk of a rare eye disease.
