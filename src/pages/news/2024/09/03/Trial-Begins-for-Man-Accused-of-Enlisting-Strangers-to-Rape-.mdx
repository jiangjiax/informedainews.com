Dominique P, 71, faces trial in Avignon for drugging his wife and orchestrating her rape by over 80 strangers for nearly a decade. Fifty men, including professionals like a journalist and a firefighter, are co-accused.

P allegedly crushed sleeping pills and anti-anxiety meds into his wife’s food or wine. He recruited men from an online chatroom obsessed with non-consensual sex. Instructions were clear: no scents, no smoke, leave if she moved.

Arrested in 2020 after filming women in a supermarket, police found a USB drive labeled “abuses” with 20,000 images and videos of the assaults. P confessed to drugging, offering, and filming his wife.

The victim, drugged to near-coma, had no memory of the rapes. She believed she had an undiagnosed illness, with her husband blaming her symptoms on fatigue. Her children suspected Alzheimer’s.

P is also linked to a 1991 Paris murder of a 23-year-old woman, where DNA evidence matches his profile. The trial, expected to last four months, could sentence P and the co-defendants to 20 years in prison.
