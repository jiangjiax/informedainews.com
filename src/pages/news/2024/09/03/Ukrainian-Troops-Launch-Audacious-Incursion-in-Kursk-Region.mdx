Ukrainian forces recently initiated a large-scale cross-border offensive in the Kursk region, marking one of the most significant operations since the conflict began in 2022. A senior Ukrainian security official stated that the operation aims to "stretch" and "disrupt" Russian defenses, with Ukrainian troops successfully breaching Russian lines. While the progress in Kursk has boosted morale, fighting continues along the eastern front, and Russian forces have not significantly withdrawn their troops. Ukrainian officials have made it clear that they do not intend to annex Russian territory but seek to influence public sentiment within Russia and create leverage for future negotiations. Additionally, Ukraine claims to have detained nearly 600 Russian soldiers as bargaining chips for the exchange of imprisoned Ukrainians. Despite the ongoing tensions, Ukraine's actions are seen as a significant blow to Russia, enhancing domestic morale and attracting international attention.
