Brazil's supreme court banned X, Elon Musk’s social media platform, for ignoring local laws. The ban affects over 21 million users. Justices voted unanimously to keep X blocked.

Flávio Dino, a court member, said X’s refusal to name a legal representative in Brazil showed it thought itself above the law. Judge Cristiano Zanin noted X’s repeated disregard for court orders.

Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who initiated the ban, also prohibited using VPNs to access X, with fines of 50,000 reais per day for violations.

Musk has criticized the court and Brazil’s left-wing government, calling the ban an attack on free speech. His company, Starlink, reportedly refuses to enforce the ban.

The conflict centers on whether foreign companies must follow Brazilian laws. Experts predict the dispute will escalate before resolution.
