Researchers turned waste into gourmet food using a special fungus. This orange mold, grown on discarded food, alters flavors dramatically. It's been used in Michelin-starred dishes, transforming leftovers into delicacies like cheese-flavored toast and sweet desserts. This method, called "upcycling," cuts food waste and greenhouse gases, boosting food security. The fungus thrives on various scraps, turning them into nutritious meals in just 36 hours. Consumers rated the new foods highly, enjoying their earthy, nutty flavors. This innovation could revolutionize how we handle food waste in high-end dining.
