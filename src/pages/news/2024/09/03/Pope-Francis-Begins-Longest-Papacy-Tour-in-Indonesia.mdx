Pope Francis, 87, embarked on his longest tour, spanning Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, East Timor, and Singapore. The 12-day, 32,000km journey marks a significant milestone in his 11-year papacy.

In Jakarta, Francis will engage with leaders of Indonesia's six recognized religions at Istiqlal mosque, emphasizing interfaith dialogue and addressing issues like violence and environmental degradation.

Security is robust, with over 4,000 law enforcement officers ensuring safety. The visit underscores Indonesia's commitment to religious diversity and harmony.

This tour, originally planned for 2020 but delayed due to COVID-19, highlights Francis's ongoing efforts in Islamic-Christian dialogue, extending his message from previous visits to Muslim-majority nations.

Despite health challenges, including recent hernia surgery and respiratory issues, Francis remains determined, traveling with medical support. His visit aims to reinforce global religious cooperation and address pressing humanitarian and environmental concerns.
