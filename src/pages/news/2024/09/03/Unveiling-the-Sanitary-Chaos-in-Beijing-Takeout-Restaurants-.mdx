CCTV journalists conducted an undercover investigation into Beijing's food delivery restaurants, revealing the stark contrast between their online glamour and offline filth. Restaurants with high ratings and sales volumes are, in fact, unsanitary home-based workshops. Delivery riders expose the truth about the kitchens, making ordering food delivery akin to a live-action murder mystery game.

"Pinduoduo for Meals" attracts customers with low prices, but the ingredients are substandard, and service is compromised. Riders refuse to deliver to upper floors due to low delivery fees, and merchants treat bundled products differently. Consumers are caught in the middle, becoming the ultimate victims.

Riders have become the "whistleblowers" in the food delivery industry, exposing unscrupulous businesses and guiding customers to clean restaurants. Although algorithms control riders, merchants, and customers, human nature and trust will ultimately transcend algorithms.

The food delivery issues expose the food safety risks under consumption downgrade. Behind the low prices lies the sacrifice of quality and service. The righteous actions of riders remind us to pay attention to food sources and support ethical businesses.
