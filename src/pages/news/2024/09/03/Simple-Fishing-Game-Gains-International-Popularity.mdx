"Happy Fishing Master," a simple mobile fishing game, unexpectedly gained popularity this year. The core gameplay is straightforward: casting and reeling. This minimalist design surprisingly attracted a large number of players and even became a hit overseas, topping the free charts in the United States and Japan.

Part of the game's success can be attributed to its precise grasp of the sense of satisfaction. Compared to the established fishing game "Fishing Clash," "Happy Fishing Master" features more detailed fish modeling and optimized game details, such as the instantly gratifying card pack design, as well as the added left-right rod swinging and hooking mechanisms, enhancing the player's immersion.

The development company behind it, Beijing Tuyoo, has always been low-profile yet highly profitable. Starting with card and board games, Tuyoo has recently attempted to expand its game types but ultimately found that simple and direct gameplay is the most appealing to players. The success of "Happy Fishing Master" demonstrates the strong appeal of simple games in the casual gaming sector.

Tuyoo's success also reminds us that game design does not need to be complex; simple and direct gameplay often resonates more with players. This simple yet repetitive action of casting and reeling is akin to eating sunflower seeds, making it hard to stop.
