Shigeru Ishiba, 67, is Japan's next prime minister, succeeding Fumio Kishida. A banker-turned-politician, Ishiba has spent 38 years in politics, focusing on security and rural revival. He was encouraged to enter politics by Kakuei Tanaka after his father, Jiro Ishiba, a former home affairs minister, passed away.

Ishiba has held key positions, including defense and agriculture minister. Despite his popularity among voters, he often clashed with LDP heavyweights. This is his fifth bid for the LDP presidency, which he won.

As a defense expert, Ishiba is concerned about Asia's security, particularly North Korea's missile launches. He advocates for a NATO-style collective security arrangement in Asia, emphasizing the U.S.-Japan alliance.

Economically, Ishiba aims to revitalize small cities like his hometown, Tottori, by rejuvenating rural industries. He supports renewable energy but seeks to reduce nuclear power's role.

Ishiba is also pushing for LDP reform, especially after recent political scandals. He advocates for transparency in political funding and the regulation of political party governance.

Outside politics, Ishiba is known for his love of trains and curry, which endears him to voters.
