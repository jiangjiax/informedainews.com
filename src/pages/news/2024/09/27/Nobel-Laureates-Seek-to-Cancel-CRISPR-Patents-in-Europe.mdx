Nobel laureates Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna seek to cancel two CRISPR patents in Europe. This move follows a European board's ruling that their initial patent filing was insufficiently clear. By withdrawing the patents, their lawyers aim to avoid a legally unfavorable precedent. This decision could reshape licensing fees for the DNA-editing technology.

**CRISPR**: A tool for editing DNA, allowing precise modifications to genes.
