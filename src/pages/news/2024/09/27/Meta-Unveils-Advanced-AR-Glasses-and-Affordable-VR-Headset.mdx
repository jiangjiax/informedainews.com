Meta unveiled its first AR smart glasses, Orion, after a decade of development. The glasses feature a sleek design, weighing just 98 grams, and offer a 70-degree field of view, making them one of the most advanced AR devices on the market. Orion integrates a split design, with a lightweight main unit, a gesture-tracking wristband, and a separate computing module. This setup allows for extended battery life and more natural interactions without the bulkiness of earlier models.

The glasses project AR content onto carbon-silicon lenses, enabling users to multitask with virtual windows and interact with the real world through Meta AI. Orion's social features include holographic calls and real-time facial scanning for video chats.

Meta also introduced Quest 3S, a more affordable version of its VR headset, Quest 3. Despite being a "youth edition," Quest 3S retains many of Quest 3's features, including the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor and hand tracking, at a lower price point.

Meta AI saw significant upgrades, with new voice capabilities and real-time translation features. The AI can now process both text and images, thanks to the new Llama 3.2 model, enhancing the functionality of Meta's hardware.

Overall, Meta's latest offerings mark a significant step towards integrating AI and AR into everyday devices, making futuristic tech more accessible and practical.
