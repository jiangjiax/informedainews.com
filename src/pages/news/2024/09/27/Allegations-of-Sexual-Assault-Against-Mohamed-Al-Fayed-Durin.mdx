More than 200 women have accused Mohamed Al Fayed of sexual assault, with several claims linked to his tenure at Fulham FC. Fayed owned the club from 1997 to 2013, investing £200m to elevate its status.

A BBC documentary sparked the recent wave of allegations, reporting that Fayed raped five Harrods employees. Justice for Harrods Survivors, a legal group, represents the accusers.

Fulham FC is investigating potential impacts on its staff. The Football Association is monitoring the situation.

Gaute Haugenes, who managed Fulham’s women’s team, said staff knew Fayed preferred young, blond women and took precautions to protect players.

Dr. Ann Coxon, a former Fayed employee, denied conducting sexual health tests on Harrods staff.

The Metropolitan Police is reviewing all existing allegations from 1979 to 2013. Though Fayed died in 2023, police aim to pursue any related criminal offenses.

Commander Stephen Clayman acknowledged the impact on victims and pledged a thorough investigation. The Met has received 19 complaints since 2005, including three rape allegations. Despite multiple approaches to the Crown Prosecution Service, no action was taken against Fayed.
