Hawaiian Airlines now offers Starlink Wi-Fi on all Airbus flights. This service utilizes over 7,000 satellites for high-speed internet. Starlink's laser mesh network ensures reliable, low-latency connections. The airline commenced testing in February and has completed installation across its Airbus fleet, which includes 24 A330s and 18 A321neos. Starlink will also be available on two Boeing 787-9 planes, but not on Boeing 717s used for shorter island flights.

*Low-latency: Minimal delay in data transmission.
