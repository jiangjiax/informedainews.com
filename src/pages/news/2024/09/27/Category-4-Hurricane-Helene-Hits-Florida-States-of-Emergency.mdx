Hurricane Helene slammed into Florida as a Category 4 storm, packing winds of 225 kph. The storm surged from the Gulf, gathering strength over warm waters. Helene's storm surge could reach 20ft, making it deadly for coastal residents.

Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, Virginia, and Alabama declared states of emergency. Governor Ron DeSantis urged evacuation, warning of flooding and power outages. Tallahassee's mayor, John Dailey, called Helene the strongest storm to hit the city.

Climate change is driving more powerful hurricanes. Helene's strength was fueled by the Gulf's unusually warm waters. Only three Gulf hurricanes since 1988 were larger.

Before landfall, parts of Florida saw water levels rise 2ft above normal. Tampa and St. Petersburg experienced 5ft storm surges. Helene is expected to move up the southeast coast, affecting 50 million people.

In North Carolina, officials warned of heavy rain and flooding. Helene knocked out power in western Cuba, affecting 230,000 customers. It also flooded parts of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.

Helene is the eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season. NOAA predicts an above-average season due to record-warm ocean temperatures.
