By the end of June 2024, China's total computing power capacity reached 246 EFLOPS, with intelligent computing power exceeding 76 EFLOPS. The number of data center racks reached 8.3 million standard racks, with over 13,000 computing power application cases covering multiple fields. There are more than 4,500 artificial intelligence enterprises. Interconnectivity achieved regional cluster latency of 5 milliseconds and national hub node latency of 20 milliseconds.

China ranks second globally in computing power scale and first in the number of supercomputers. The number of 5G base stations exceeded 4 million, accounting for 33.5%. The intelligent computing power scale of central enterprises doubled year-on-year. Internet business revenue grew by 5.6% year-on-year.

**EFLOPS**: ExaFLOPS, quintillion floating-point operations per second.
