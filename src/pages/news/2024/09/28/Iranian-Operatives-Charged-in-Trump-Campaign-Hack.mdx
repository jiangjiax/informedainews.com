The US Justice Department charged three Iranian operatives with hacking Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign. The hackers aimed to undermine Trump’s bid by leaking stolen documents to media outlets. Despite the leaks, major news organizations like Politico, the New York Times, and the Washington Post chose not to publish the sensitive information.

US Attorney General Merrick Garland noted a surge in Iranian cyber activity during this election cycle. Intelligence linked Iran to not only the Trump campaign hack but also an attempted breach of the Biden-Harris campaign. The operation sought to sow discord and influence the election outcome, seen as crucial to Iran’s national security.

Iran also sent unsolicited emails with hacked information to Biden campaign associates, though none responded. The Harris campaign labeled these emails as spam or phishing attempts.

The indictment comes amid escalating tensions between the US and Iran, including suspected Iranian plots to assassinate Trump. US intelligence briefed Trump on these threats, unrelated to previous failed assassination attempts.
