Hanoi's new Metro Line 3, an 8.5-kilometer above-ground stretch connecting Nhon and Cau Giay, has quickly won over commuters. In its first 15 days, over 750,000 passengers rode for free. Regular fares start at 8,000 dong (30 cents), with a day pass at 24,000 dong.

The line, adorned with vibrant Vietnamese imagery, offers a scenic ride akin to a mini-trip. Many riders are students and tech workers, drawn by the universities and companies along the route. Beyond the city center, the line serves high-rise residential areas, promising relief from traffic congestion.

Currently, the line stops short of Hanoi Station, with construction ongoing on a 4-km underground section. Despite this, the line's potential to spur development in outlying areas is clear.

Hanoi Metro's revenue rose 7% in 2023 to 515.2 billion dong, with net profit nearly sextupling to 13.1 billion dong, thanks to strong ridership on Line 2A. With Line 3 now operational, further growth is expected in 2024.

Meanwhile, Ho Chi Minh City's subway, backed by Japan, faces delays due to administrative issues and COVID-19.
