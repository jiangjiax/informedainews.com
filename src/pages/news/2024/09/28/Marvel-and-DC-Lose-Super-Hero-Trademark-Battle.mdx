A U.S. Trademark Office tribunal has canceled Marvel and DC's "Super Hero" trademarks. London-based Superbabies Ltd argued that the marks should not monopolize the superhero genre. Marvel and DC failed to respond. Superbabies attorney Adam Adler called it a "victory for creativity and innovation." The ruling opens the term "Super Heroes" to all storytellers.
