A class action lawsuit has been filed in Taiwan against Kobayashi Pharmaceutical, alleging that the company's red yeast rice dietary supplements harmed 55 people. The supplements have been linked to over 100 deaths in Japan. The lawsuit seeks $5.32 million in damages. Puberulic acid, found in the supplements, can cause renal tubular necrosis, according to Japan's health ministry. Kobayashi Pharmaceutical announced in August it will discontinue its red yeast rice business.

*Renal tubular necrosis: a condition where the small tubes in the kidneys that help filter waste are damaged.*
