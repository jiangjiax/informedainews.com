Hurricane Helene, once a 140 mph (225 kph) monster, ravaged Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, and Virginia, resulting in at least 44 fatalities. The storm weakened but continued to flood Tennessee, prompting rescue operations.

In Erwin, Tennessee, the Unicoi County Hospital was inundated; patients were evacuated by raft. Over three million people lost power across Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, and the Carolinas, with additional outages reported in Ohio and Indiana.

Tornadoes spawned by the storm injured four in North Carolina. Atlanta experienced its heaviest rainfall in history—11.2 inches (28.4 cm) over two days.

Helene struck Florida’s Big Bend, a quiet coastal region. It also disrupted Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula and Cuba, cutting power to 200,000 homes.

President Biden approved emergency aid for Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. He and Vice President Harris offered prayers for the victims.

**Explanation:**
- **Post-tropical cyclone:** A storm that loses its tropical characteristics but still carries strong winds and rain.
- **Intubated patients:** Patients who have a tube inserted into their windpipe to help them breathe.
