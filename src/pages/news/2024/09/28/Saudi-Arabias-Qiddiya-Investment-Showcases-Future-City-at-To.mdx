Saudi Arabia’s Qiddiya Investment showcased its future city at the Tokyo Game Show 2024. The booth, bathed in neon blue and pink, featured a DJ booth, bar, and crane game. Prince Faisal bin Bandar bin Sultan Al Saud, vice chair of Savvy Games Group, expressed hope for collaboration between Saudi Arabia and Japan.

Qiddiya, a planned city near Riyadh, aims to be a hub for entertainment, sports, and the arts. It’s part of Saudi Vision 2030, a strategy to diversify the economy away from oil. Qiddiya Investment, under the Public Investment Fund (PIF), is driving this development. PIF holds stakes in Japanese gaming companies like Nintendo, Capcom, and Koei Tecmo Holdings.

Shigenori Araki, an advisory board member of Qiddiya Gaming, noted a surge in inquiries from media and companies. Layla Albabtain, founder of Player One, a Saudi game development studio, showcased her work at the show, finding positive feedback.

Prince Faisal is excited about AI’s potential in gaming, envisioning games that evolve with each play. He views Japan as the “birthplace of gaming and esports.” For him, meaningful conversations pave the way for collaboration, investment, and friendship.
