In 2023, a duo on Xiaohongshu, @肚肚小盆友 and @爱肚肚的皮皮, garnered over 2 million followers by playing with "slime"—a gooey, stress-relieving toy. Their videos, featuring large, colorful slimes being stretched and squished, captivated audiences with their satisfying sounds and visuals.

The secret to their success? Engaging content that taps into the growing "stress-relief economy." Videos blend sensory stimulation—sight, sound, and touch—with interactive elements, like fulfilling viewer requests. This creates a loyal fan base eager to see their favorite slimes manipulated in new ways.

The trend extends beyond these two. "Nienie" toys—soft, moldable figures—have also surged in popularity, with millions of views on related Xiaohongshu posts. Influencers like @宋黛cony and @陈胖快乐日记 have capitalized on this, sharing unboxing and crafting videos that resonate with stressed-out viewers.

Is this a lucrative business? Absolutely. Slime and nienie toys are cheap to produce but sell for premium prices, especially when customized. Some sellers report margins as high as 60%, with limited-edition items fetching thousands.

However, the market is crowded with small-scale, often unregulated sellers. Quality varies, and safety concerns linger. Yet, for those adept at social media marketing, the rewards are substantial.

In essence, this niche thrives on creativity, community engagement, and a universal need for relief from modern pressures. It's a testament to how digital platforms can turn simple, soothing pastimes into thriving enterprises.
