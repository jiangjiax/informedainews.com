Jammu and Kashmir, India’s northern region, held its first assembly election in a decade on September 18, 2024. The polls follow the 2019 repeal of the area’s special status by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). This status, unique to Jammu and Kashmir, allowed only local residents to buy property and secure jobs. The region, long a flashpoint between India and Pakistan, saw its autonomy revoked and was split into two federally governed territories: Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.

The election aims to form a local government pressing for regional development and security. Some parties seek restoration of statehood. With 90 seats up for grabs and 8.7 million registered voters, the polls are crucial. The second and third phases of voting are set for September 25 and October 1, with results due on October 8.

Modi, addressing a rally, vowed a “secure and prosperous” Jammu and Kashmir, criticizing past governments for neglecting the people’s needs. The BJP’s popularity in the region has waned since the autonomy repeal, with some observers noting its weak presence in Kashmir.

The election is significant, reflecting ongoing tensions and the complex dynamics of a region central to India’s identity and security.
