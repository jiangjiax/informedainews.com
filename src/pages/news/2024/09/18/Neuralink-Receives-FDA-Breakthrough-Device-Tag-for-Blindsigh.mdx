Neuralink, founded by Elon Musk, has received the FDA's "breakthrough device" designation for its Blindsight implant.

The FDA's breakthrough tag expedites development and review for devices addressing life-threatening conditions. Neuralink has not yet announced when human trials for Blindsight will begin.
