China’s recent decision to raise the retirement age is not a knee-jerk reaction but a calculated move. Men will retire at 63, women at 58. These changes roll out gradually over 15 years, affecting those born after specific years.

The strategy is clever. Men born in 1968, a high-birth-year, will work nearly an extra year. Women, especially blue-collar workers who faced hardships, get a longer retirement to enjoy time with family.

This isn’t just about numbers. It’s about balancing economic needs with social equity. The changes benefit those who started working post-Mao, during Deng Xiaoping’s reforms. It acknowledges the struggles of older generations while setting a path for younger, better-educated workers.

For younger generations, a later retirement isn’t a burden but an opportunity. Many, especially educated urban women, might prefer to work longer.

In essence, this policy is a blend of pragmatism and compassion. It extends working lives to sustain economic growth while ensuring older workers get more time to enjoy their later years.
