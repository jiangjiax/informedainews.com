Israel's Mossad planted explosives in 5,000 pagers imported by Hezbollah, leading to a massive explosion that killed nine and wounded nearly 3,000. The pagers, sourced from Taiwan-based Gold Apollo, were actually manufactured by BAC Consulting in Budapest. Gold Apollo denied responsibility, stating BAC had a license to use their brand.

The operation was months in the making, following a series of assassinations of Hezbollah and Hamas leaders. Hezbollah, using pagers to avoid Israeli tracking, unknowingly activated the explosives via a coded message. The Mossad modified the devices at the production level, embedding a board with explosive material.

Hezbollah vowed retaliation, marking this as their biggest security breach since the Gaza conflict. The group had already lost 170 fighters to Israeli strikes. Nasrallah, Hezbollah's leader, warned supporters to secure their phones, highlighting the vulnerability of modern communication.

This incident underscores the high stakes of espionage and the constant evolution of warfare tactics. Hezbollah's reliance on low-tech communication failed to protect them from sophisticated Israeli intelligence operations. The fallout will likely escalate tensions, pushing both sides closer to all-out conflict.
