Chipotle has introduced Autocado, a robot designed to peel avocados. This prototype slices, pits, and skins each avocado in 26 seconds. The machine, tested in California, aims to free employees for other tasks. Chipotle also tests an automated Makeline, assembling bowls and salads beneath the usual prep area. These innovations are part of a $100 million investment in Vebu and Hyphen, companies developing these systems.

**Cobots**: Collaborative robots designed to work alongside human workers.
