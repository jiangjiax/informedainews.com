China's OLED industry, after a decade of pursuit, surpassed South Korea in the first quarter of 2024 to become the global leader in production. OLED technology, with its advantages of high contrast, ultra-thinness, and flexibility, has become the next-generation display technology. However, the core material FMM (Fine Metal Mask) has long been monopolized by Japan's DNP, restricting the development of China's OLED industry.

Xu Huawei's company, Zhongling Technology, has focused on the localization of FMM. After four years of research and development, it has overcome the bottleneck of Invar alloy material and achieved mass production of FMM. In 2023, Zhongling Technology's FMM products passed customer verification, breaking DNP's monopoly and reducing domestic panel manufacturers' reliance on a single supplier.

FMM is a critical mold in OLED production, directly affecting panel quality. DNP implements quality differences for different customers, limiting the high-end product manufacturing capabilities of Chinese panel manufacturers. Zhongling Technology has improved FMM quality through independent research and development of Invar alloy and has applied it to mid-to-high-end products of various terminal brands.

In the future, with the rise of companies like Zhongling Technology, China's OLED industry will break free from technological blockade and embrace broader development opportunities.
