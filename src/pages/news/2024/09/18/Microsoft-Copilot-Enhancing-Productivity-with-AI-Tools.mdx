Microsoft Copilot is a suite of AI tools designed to boost productivity across various Microsoft software and services. It includes over a dozen Copilot-branded products, each tailored for specific tasks like summarizing emails in Outlook or generating code with GitHub Copilot.

Copilot integrates with Windows, Bing, and Microsoft Edge, offering functions like writing, translating, and image creation. It can also control certain Windows 11 settings, acting as a digital assistant.

There are two main versions: Copilot Pro ($20/month) and Microsoft 365 Copilot ($30/user/month). Pro offers priority access to advanced AI models and features across Microsoft 365 apps, while 365 Copilot includes enterprise-grade data protection and personalized responses.

Copilot Studio allows users to customize Copilots, creating tailored AI assistants for specific tasks. GitHub Copilot, separate from the main suite, assists developers with code generation and troubleshooting.

Microsoft's Copilot ecosystem is vast, aiming to enhance productivity and streamline tasks across various platforms and user needs.
