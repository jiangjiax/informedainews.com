Rice is Japan’s soul, as essential as wine to France. Over 500 varieties, each unique, are grown. To older Japanese, a meal without rice isn’t a meal. Rice lore is rich, from family heirlooms to rituals.

Chef Jiro Ono insists perfect sushi starts with perfect rice. At Narita Airport, Chinese tourists smuggle 30-kg bags of Koshihikari, the king of rice. But climate change threatens this staple. Heat and pests strain crops, prompting research for heat-resistant varieties.

Neighborhood rice shops fade as online and supermarket sales rise. Yet, storage capacity is at a 30-year low. This summer, Tokyo supermarkets rationed rice. Historically, rice was currency. Post-WWII, it traded for luxury items.

Today, population decline and hotter summers shrink output. Typhoons empty shelves. Rice imports are minimal, mainly for restaurants. Japanese prefer their own rice.

Experts suggest robots and computers could boost production. But rice’s emotional value complicates this. Digitizing its production might do more harm than good.
