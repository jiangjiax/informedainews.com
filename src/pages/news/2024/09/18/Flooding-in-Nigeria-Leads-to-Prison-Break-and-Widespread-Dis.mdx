In Maiduguri, Nigeria, over 200 inmates escaped from a flooded prison. The flood, the worst in two decades, followed the collapse of a dam on September 9. 37 people died, and 200,000 were displaced. The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) reported submerged buildings and widespread chaos.

The Nigerian Correctional Service (NCS) stated that 281 inmates fled during transfer to a safer facility. Seven were recaptured, leaving 274 at large. The flood destroyed prison walls and staff quarters. A joint search with other security agencies is underway.

Wildlife from the Sanda Kyarimi Park zoo, including reptiles and lions, was also displaced into residential areas. Temporary shelters in six camps house the displaced. Maiduguri, once a hub for Boko Haram’s insurgency, saw previous IDP camps closed in recent years.

The United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) warns of acute food insecurity for 31.8 million Nigerians. Aid workers fear worsening conditions and potential disease outbreaks like cholera in crowded camps.

In April, the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency predicted floods across 36 states. The actual impact exceeded forecasts due to climate change. 29 states are affected, with 1.3 million hectares (3.2 million acres) submerged, half of which is cropland.

Vice-President Kashim Shettima acknowledged the severity of the flood, vowing to find lasting solutions. However, infrastructure struggles to cope. Suwaiba Dankabo of Action Aid Nigeria highlighted destroyed road networks complicating aid delivery.

The situation mirrors flooding in Cameroon’s Far North region, where dykes broke, collapsing 3,700 houses. The Benue River, shared by Cameroon and Nigeria, hosts the Lagdo dam, a yearly source of flooding. States like Adamawa, adjacent to Borno, face imminent risk from expected dam discharges.
