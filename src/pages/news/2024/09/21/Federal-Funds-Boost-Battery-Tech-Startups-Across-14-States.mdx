The federal government has just invested $3 billion into 25 battery technology startups across 14 states. This funding, part of a $16 billion allocation from the Department of Energy, aims to bolster local battery manufacturing, processing, and recycling. The objective? To reduce dependence on China, the current leader in battery production.

South Carolina received the largest share of fundsâ€”$850 million for five projects. Michigan followed with $355 million. One notable recipient: Cirba Solutions was awarded $200 million to construct a facility for producing battery-grade salts.

This investment covers the entire battery supply chain, from mineral extraction to recycling. The initiative aims to create 18,000 jobs and shift the battery industry's center of gravity.
