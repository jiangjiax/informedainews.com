Russia's relentless attacks on Ukraine's power infrastructure have crippled its electricity generation. The International Energy Agency (IEA) warns that Ukraine may face severe shortages this winter. By mid-year, only a third of pre-war capacity remained. Rolling blackouts are now common, with some regions receiving power for just a few hours daily.

The IEA predicts a winter peak demand of 18.5 gigawatts (GW), but with imports, a 6 GW shortfall is likely. This winter will be the toughest test yet for Ukraine's energy system since Russia's invasion. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss EU energy assistance.
