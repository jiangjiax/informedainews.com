Thwaites Glacier, known as the "Doomsday Glacier," is melting faster. It holds enough ice to raise sea levels by over two feet. Scientists used ice-breaking ships and underwater robots to study it. They found warm ocean water melting the ice through deep cracks. While a catastrophic collapse is less likely, the glacier could disintegrate within 200 years. This could lead to a 10-foot sea level rise, devastating coastal areas.
