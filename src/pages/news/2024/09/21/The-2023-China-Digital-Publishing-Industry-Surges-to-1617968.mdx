In 2023, China's digital publishing industry surged to 1,617.968 billion yuan, a 19.08% increase. The digitization of traditional media saw modest growth at 8.56%, reaching 113.89 billion yuan. Online education and web-based anime contributed significantly, with revenues of 288.2 billion and 36.403 billion yuan, respectively.
