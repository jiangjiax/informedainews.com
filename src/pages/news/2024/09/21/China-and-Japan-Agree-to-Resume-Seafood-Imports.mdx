Japan and China agree to resume seafood imports. China halted them in 2022 due to Fukushima's treated water release. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will expand monitoring, including Chinese and other experts collecting samples. Based on these results, China will resume imports meeting its safety standards. Japan aims for a complete lift of the suspension.
