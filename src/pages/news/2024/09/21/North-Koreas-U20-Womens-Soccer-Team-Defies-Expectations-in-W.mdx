North Korea's U-20 women's soccer team has defied expectations by reaching the World Cup final in Colombia. This achievement follows years of isolation and limited international play. The team's success is attributed to the North Korean ideology of "juche," emphasizing self-reliance.

The team, coached by Ri Song Ho, has dominated the tournament, winning all six games. They scored 24 goals and conceded only four. Ri's innovative tactics, including early substitutions, have been praised.

This victory marks a significant return for North Korea, which had struggled in recent years due to bans and lack of international competition. The team's performance suggests that self-reliance and internal development can rival international preparation.

North Korea's women are once again a global force in soccer.
