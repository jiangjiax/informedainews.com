Sri Lanka's presidential election commenced on Saturday, with 17 million voters poised to determine the nation's future trajectory following a debilitating economic crisis. The contest is closely contested, featuring incumbent Ranil Wickremesinghe, Marxist candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake, and opposition leader Sajith Premadasa.

Wickremesinghe, who assumed office in 2022 after Gotabaya Rajapaksa's departure, is under scrutiny for his economic management. Although he restructured over $17 billion in debt and secured an IMF agreement, high taxes and living costs remain pressing issues. Dissanayake and Premadasa pledge to renegotiate the IMF terms, with the goal of easing austerity measures.

The economic collapse, fueled by excessive borrowing and exacerbated by COVID-19, resulted in severe shortages of essential goods and widespread unrest. Critics of Wickremesinghe accuse him of protecting the Rajapaksa family, who are held responsible for the crisis. His initial election was largely supported by Rajapaksa loyalists.

Results are anticipated on Sunday, with the outcome expected to significantly influence Sri Lanka's path to recovery and stability.
