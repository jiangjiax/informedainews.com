ASTANA, Kazakhstan — The Fifth World Nomad Games, held in Astana, Kazakhstan, brought together over 2,000 competitors from 89 countries. This biennial event, now in its 10th year, celebrates Central Asian sports and culture.

Kazakhstan dominated with 112 medals, including 43 golds. Kyrgyzstan followed with 65 medals. Russia, Uzbekistan, Mongolia, and Iran also made strong showings.

The games featured 21 disciplines rooted in traditional nomadic life, including archery, wrestling, and horse racing. Audaryspak, a horseback wrestling event, and zhamby atu, a horseback archery competition, showcased the skills of riders.

Kokpar, a wild equine sport involving a decapitated goat, was a highlight. Kazakhstan won this event, which is akin to horseback rugby or polo.

Wrestling styles like qazaq kuresi and kurash were also featured. Betty Vuk, an Italian woman, won Italy’s first gold in the women’s qazaq kuresi event.

Kusbegilik, an endangered art of hunting with birds of prey, judged the flight speed and responsiveness of eagles, falcons, and hawks.

The games not only showcased physical prowess but also preserved the rich cultural heritage of Central Asia’s nomadic peoples.
