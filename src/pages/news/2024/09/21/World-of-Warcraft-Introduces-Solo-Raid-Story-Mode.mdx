World of Warcraft introduces "Story Mode," allowing solo players to complete raid storylines. Previously, raids required groups. Story Mode simplifies the final boss fight, removing complex mechanics to focus on narrative. Rewards differ from harder modes, preserving their value. Currently exclusive to the Nerub-ar Palace raid, Blizzard hints at broader application. This move expands accessibility, catering to diverse play styles.
