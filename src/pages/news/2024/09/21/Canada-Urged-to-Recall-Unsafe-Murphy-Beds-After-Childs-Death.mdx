A five-year-old boy died when a Murphy bed, lacking safety features, crashed down on him in a Quebec hotel. Coroner Donald Nicole urges Canada to recall all unsafe Murphy beds and enforce international safety standards.

Murphy beds, or wall beds, fold into walls. The boy, Anthony Putnam, was playing under one when it suddenly opened. The bed lacked a locking mechanism and didn’t meet ISO 10131 safety standards.

Nicole’s report found the bed’s springs had low resistance, allowing it to open rapidly. This isn’t the first such incident; two other deaths in 20 years prompted similar calls for safety standards.

Despite the tragedy, some manufacturers continue selling unsafe beds. The hotel quickly upgraded its beds with safety notices and restraints. However, the manufacturer, Les meubles BOFF Inc., hasn’t confirmed compliance with safety standards.

Nicole recommends Health Canada mandate ISO 10131 compliance and remove non-compliant beds from the market. He also urges hotel associations to inform guests of the risks.

Health Canada acknowledges the need for stricter regulations, working with international bodies to enhance safety beyond current standards.
