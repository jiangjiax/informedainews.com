In 2019, a new tick-borne virus, Wetland Virus (WELV), was discovered in a Chinese patient. Researchers tested 680 patients with tick bites and fever; 20 were WELV-positive. Symptoms ranged from fever to neurological issues. WELV was found in 2% of 14,500 ticks, suggesting the vector is the Haemaphysalis concinna tick. The virus also infected rodents, sheep, pigs, and horses, potentially facilitating wider transmission. Monitoring and detection are crucial to understanding WELV's impact on human health.
