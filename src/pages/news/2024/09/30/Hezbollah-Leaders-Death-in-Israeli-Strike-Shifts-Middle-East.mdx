Hezbollah confirmed the death of its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in an Israeli strike. This escalation marks a significant shift in Israel’s campaign against Iran’s proxies in the Middle East. Nasrallah’s death, following the bombing of Hezbollah’s underground headquarters, raises questions about the future of Iran’s strategy and Hezbollah’s strength.

Iran, though condemning the attack, has not retaliated directly, leading some to speculate it avoids a direct confrontation with Israel. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei affirmed regional resistance forces’ support for Hezbollah.

The strike complicates cease-fire negotiations between Israel and Hezbollah. Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, declared victory, while President Biden called for diplomatic resolution.

Nasrallah’s death was part of a sudden barrage, with over 80 bombs dropped in minutes. The operation also killed a senior Iranian commander, Brig. Gen. Abbas Nilofouroshan. Casualties in Lebanon are expected to rise.

Nasrallah’s demise is a significant blow to Hezbollah, ending an era in its conflict with Israel. Hezbollah and Israel both vow to continue fighting.

Nasrallah, a Shiite cleric, led Hezbollah since 1992, transforming it into a powerful political and military force. His death sparked mourning and celebrations across the region.

**Key Terms:**
- **Hezbollah:** A Lebanese militia and political party.
- **Ayatollah Ali Khamenei:** Iran’s supreme leader.
- **Brig. Gen. Abbas Nilofouroshan:** A senior Iranian commander killed in the strike.
