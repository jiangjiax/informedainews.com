Manchester United's Erik ten Hag faced the lowest point of his tenure as Tottenham humiliated them 3-0. The match was a disorganized and chaotic display, with Spurs exploiting United's porous defense. Bruno Fernandes' red card compounded the misery, leaving him suspended for three league games.

United rallied briefly with ten men, showing glimpses of potential. However, Brennan Johnson, Dejan Kulesevksi, and Dominic Solanke scored, with Solanke's goal coming from a well-executed corner. Ten Hag, drenched in rain, watched his team crumble.

The defeat, coupled with recent draws, leaves Ten Hag's position precarious. United's next matches, against Porto in the Europa League and Aston Villa in the Premier League, are crucial. The jubilant Spurs fans' chant echoed as Ten Hag navigated the sacking territory.
