The U.S. Department of Commerce has proposed a ban on the use of software and hardware from China in connected and autonomous vehicles, citing "national security" concerns. The ban covers vehicles equipped with communication or autonomous driving systems, including those with Bluetooth, satellite, cellular, and WiFi connectivity, as well as autonomous vehicles.

The ban is planned to take effect for software in 2027 and for hardware in 2029 or 2030. The move aims to prevent potential national security threats posed by Chinese and Russian vehicles in the future. U.S. officials are concerned that Chinese companies could collect data from American drivers and potentially remotely control connected vehicles on U.S. roads.

China is one of the largest automotive exporters globally, but the number of vehicles exported to the U.S. is relatively small. In 2023, China exported approximately 74,800 passenger vehicles to the U.S., including about 18,600 new energy vehicles.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo stated that the move is intended to address new national security issues before they become widely prevalent. The ban also includes restrictions on other sectors, such as drones and cloud infrastructure.

Industry insiders point out that the development of automotive software and hardware is complex and time-consuming, making it nearly impossible to completely replace them in the short term. Chinese suppliers are becoming increasingly important in the global automotive industry, such as CATL and BYD.

There are exemptions in the ban; companies can apply for exemptions if they can demonstrate effective mitigation measures. The Chinese government has urged the U.S. to stop unreasonable打压行为, and European and other countries are concerned that this move could exacerbate the global trade environment.

Commentators believe that the U.S. move is essentially banning Chinese cars from entering the market under the guise of "national security," acting as a trade protection measure that, while giving the domestic automotive industry time, disrupts the global automotive industry landscape.
