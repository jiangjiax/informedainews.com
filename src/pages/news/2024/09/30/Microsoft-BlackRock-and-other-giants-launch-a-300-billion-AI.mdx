Microsoft, BlackRock, and other giants have joined forces to launch a fund exceeding $30 billion, named the "Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership" (GAIIP). The fund aims to invest in AI infrastructure such as data centers and energy equipment, with an initial target of raising $30 billion and a future goal of up to $100 billion.

The GAIIP fund is initiated by Microsoft, BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), and the UAE-based technology investment company MGX. NVIDIA also supports the initiative, providing expertise in AI data centers and AI factories.

The fund primarily invests in the United States, with smaller investments in partner countries. Its objective is to drive AI innovation and economic growth by efficiently scaling data centers.

BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink stated that data centers are the cornerstone of the digital economy, and these investments will drive economic growth, AI technology innovation, and job creation.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella emphasized that GAIIP will help realize the vision of AI-driven innovation by bringing together financial and industry leaders to build future infrastructure.

The development of AI requires robust energy support. Training large language models consumes significant amounts of electricity, with global data center energy consumption expected to double by 2026. The U.S. Department of Energy forecasts a 15% to 20% increase in electricity demand over the next decade.

The GAIIP fund is expected to address the substantial energy infrastructure needs required by AI, reflecting Wall Street's investment interest and confidence in the AI sector.
