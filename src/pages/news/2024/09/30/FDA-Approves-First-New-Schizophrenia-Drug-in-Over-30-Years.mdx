The FDA approved Cobenfy, the first new schizophrenia drug in over 30 years. Unlike older antipsychotics, which alter dopamine, Cobenfy adjusts acetylcholineâ€”a brain chemical affecting memory and attention. This shift may reduce common side effects like weight gain and drowsiness. In trials, only 6% of patients stopped Cobenfy due to side effects, compared to 20-30% with older drugs. Schizophrenia affects about 24 million people globally. Further studies aim to test Cobenfy for Alzheimer's and bipolar disorder.
