Canadian photographer Patricia Homonylo won the "Bird Photographer of the Year" and "Conservation" awards for a haunting image of 4000 bird carcasses, victims of window collisions. In North America, over 13 billion birds die annually from such impacts. Homonylo, part of the Fatal Light Awareness Program (FLAP), documents these deaths to raise awareness. She advocates for bird-safe window treatments.

The "Conservation" category also featured a pair of lovebirds separated in cages, and a Northern Gannet entangled in fishing line. These images starkly highlight the plight of birds in human environments.

The competition, with 23,000 entries, includes categories like "Bird Behavior," "Birds in Flight," and "Humorous Birds." It emphasizes authenticity, banning AI and excessive editing.

Homonylo's work underscores the silent, massive toll of urban development on wildlife. Her images are a call to action, urging us to reconsider our built environment and its impact on the natural world.
