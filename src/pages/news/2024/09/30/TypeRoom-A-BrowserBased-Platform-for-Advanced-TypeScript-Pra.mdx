TypeScript demands more than just basic type annotations. "Type Challenges" by antfu offers advanced exercises, but current solutions—whether using TypeScript Playground, local projects, or VSCode extensions—suffer from readability and tooling issues.

TypeRoom addresses these challenges. It’s a browser-based platform that clearly separates problem descriptions from answer areas, requires no setup, and stores progress in the cloud. Simply open a URL to start practicing.

**TypeScript Playground**: An online environment for testing TypeScript code.
**Type Challenges**: A repository of TypeScript type system exercises.
