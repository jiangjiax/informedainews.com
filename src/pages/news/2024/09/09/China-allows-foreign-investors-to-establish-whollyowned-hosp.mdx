The Ministry of Commerce, the National Health Commission, and the National Medical Products Administration have jointly issued a document, announcing that foreign-invested enterprises will be allowed to engage in the development and application of human stem cells, gene diagnosis, and treatment technologies in the free trade zones of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, and other 9 regions, as well as in the Hainan Free Trade Port. Additionally, plans are in place to establish wholly foreign-owned hospitals (excluding traditional Chinese medicine and excluding acquisitions of public hospitals) in these areas. This move aims to promote the development of biotechnology and the medical field, and to enhance China's medical standards.

**Brief Analysis**:
- **Wholly Foreign-Owned Hospital**: Refers to a hospital that is fully owned by foreign capital.
- **Human Stem Cells**: Primitive cells with the potential for self-replication and multi-directional differentiation, used in medical research to treat a variety of diseases.
- **Gene Diagnosis and Treatment**: An emerging technology that involves analyzing individual genetic information for disease diagnosis and treatment.
