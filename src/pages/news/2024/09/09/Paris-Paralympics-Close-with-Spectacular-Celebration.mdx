The Paris Paralympics concluded with a grand celebration at the Stade de France, blending fireworks, laser shows, and electrifying dance performances. Jean-Michel Jarre, the French electronic music pioneer, led the festivities, joined by DJ Martin Solveig and iconic acts like Amadou and Mariam. The event showcased France's prowess in electronic dance music and its commitment to inclusivity.

Para athletes from around the world danced and celebrated, reflecting the Games' spirit of overcoming barriers. The closing ceremony highlighted the transformative impact of the Paralympics on French society, shifting attitudes towards disability and sport.

Andrew Parsons, president of the International Paralympic Committee, praised the event as the most spectacular Paralympic Games ever, noting the record-breaking participation and global coverage. The Paris 2024 Games set a new benchmark, selling a combined 12 million tickets for both the Olympics and Paralympics, surpassing previous records.

Tony Estanguet, chief organiser of the Paris Olympics, emphasized the Games' role in fostering an inclusive world. He acknowledged the Paralympians' contribution to a lasting cultural shift, ensuring that the Paralympic revolution continues.

The celebration, despite a torrential downpour, underscored the resilience and joy of the athletes and spectators alike. As Paris handed over to Los Angeles for the 2028 Games, the legacy of inclusivity and celebration was firmly cemented.
