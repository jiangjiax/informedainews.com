The Qinghai Provincial Government SASAC, Qinghai Guotou, and China Minmetals have signed an agreement to jointly establish China Salt Lake Industry Group Co., Ltd. (tentative name). China Minmetals will hold a 53% stake, becoming the controlling shareholder. This move aims to accelerate the joint construction of a world-class salt lake industry base and create a world-class salt lake industry group.

The controlling shareholder of Salt Lake Co. will change from Qinghai Guotou to China Salt Lake Group, and the actual controller will change from the Qinghai Provincial Government SASAC to China Minmetals. This transaction involves the cash purchase of 681 million shares of Salt Lake Co. at a total price of 13.558 billion yuan.

In recent years, Salt Lake Co. has focused on building a world-class salt lake industry base, with stable potassium chloride production capacity at 5 million tons and lithium carbonate production capacity reaching 40,000 tons. In the first half of the year, it achieved operating income of 7.237 billion yuan and net profit of 2.212 billion yuan.

China Minmetals' subsidiary, Wumine Salt Lake Co., has some experience in the salt lake field, having already built a 10,000-ton/year lithium carbonate project and a 300,000-ton/year potassium chloride project.

The Qinghai Provincial Government has long planned to establish China Salt Lake Group, and this cooperation will accelerate that process. The industry believes that resource integration will be a future focus, especially with the decline in lithium prices, making resource integration more cost-effective.

**Brief Analysis:**
This restructuring marks a new stage of development for China's salt lake industry. China Minmetals' entry will bring funds, technology, and management experience, helping to enhance Salt Lake Co.'s competitiveness. At the same time, resource integration will optimize the industrial layout and promote the construction of a world-class salt lake industry base.
