Candied Wax Bottles, a brightly colored and cute snack, have recently exploded in popularity among children. Merchants claim they are "handmade," yet lack complete packaging and necessary information, making them "three-no products" (no production date, no quality certification, no manufacturer information). These candies are hot sellers at night markets, around schools, and on e-commerce platforms, but pose food safety risks.

Merchants claim the outer shell of Candied Wax Bottles is made from beeswax, but the actual ingredients are unclear and may contain harmful substances. Some products have even been found to contain no beeswax, posing a potential cancer risk. Additionally, the additives in these candies could threaten children's health.

The popularity of Candied Wax Bottles has also led to environmental issues, as their residues form stubborn stains on the streets that are difficult to remove. From a legal perspective, the production and sale of these candies are in violation, particularly when children are used in promotional videos, which contravenes the law on the protection of minors.

Regulatory authorities should strengthen inspections and crack down on three-no products to ensure children's food safety. Parents need to be more vigilant and guide their children away from such products. The title of "internet celebrity" should not be a cover for inferior products. Protecting consumer rights and the health of young people is a top priority.
