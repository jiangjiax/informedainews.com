Disney suffered a data breach this summer. Hackers, calling themselves "NullBulge," infiltrated Disney's internal Slack channels, stealing over 1TB of data. The breach exposed more than 44 million messages, 18,800 spreadsheets, and 13,000 PDFs.

The stolen data includes sensitive information on Disney Cruise Line staff and guests, as well as Disneyland attendees. Personal details such as physical addresses, birthdates, passport numbers, and visa information were compromised. Affected guests had their names, addresses, and phone numbers leaked.

Financial data was also breached. Disney+ made $2.4 billion in revenue during the second quarter of 2024. The leak revealed that Disney+ contributes 43% of revenue for Disney's direct-to-consumer entertainment business. Additionally, Disney's Genie+ service, which allowed guests to skip lines at Disney World, generated over $724 million between October 2021 and June 2024.

The breach underscores the vulnerability of even the largest corporations to cyberattacks. Disney's response and the extent of the damage remain unclear.
