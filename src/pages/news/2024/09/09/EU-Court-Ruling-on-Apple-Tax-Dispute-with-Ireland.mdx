The European Union is set to rule on a long-standing tax dispute between Apple, Ireland, and the EU Commission. At issue is $14.5 billion in back taxes stemming from a 2004 tax deal. Apple's non-US headquarters are in Cork, Ireland, making this case crucial for the company's global operations.

Ireland granted Apple a 10-year tax deal in 2004, allowing the tech giant to exploit a loophole known as the "Double Irish." This scheme enabled Apple to list intellectual property as intangible assets, avoiding tax on them. Only the subsidiary handling administrative tasks was taxed.

The "Double Irish" loophole was closed in 2014, but existing users like Apple could continue until 2020. An EU investigation concluded the deal was illegal, prompting Apple to exit voluntarily. The EU demanded Apple pay 13 billion Euros, plus interest, to Ireland.

Ireland and Apple appealed, arguing the EU overstepped. The EU General Court sided with Apple in 2020, but the EU appealed to the Court of Justice. The advocate general recently advised the Court of Justice to annul the General Court's ruling, citing errors in Ireland's defense.

If the Court of Justice agrees, the case would return to the General Court for retrial. This could take years, with the final outcome uncertain. Apple might have to disperse the 13 billion Euros held in escrow if the EU proves Ireland's laws favored Apple.

This dispute highlights the complexities of international tax law and the lengths to which companies and governments go to protect their interests. The final ruling could set a precedent for future tax cases involving multinational corporations.
