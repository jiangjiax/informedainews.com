Pedro Almodóvar’s *The Room Next Door* won the Golden Lion at Venice. His first English-language film, it delves into euthanasia and the climate crisis. Starring Tilda Swinton and Julianne Moore, it received an 18-minute standing ovation. Almodóvar, 74, praised euthanasia, criticizing countries where it’s illegal.

The Silver Lion was awarded to Maura Delpero’s *Vermiglio*, a WWII drama. Nicole Kidman won Best Actress for *Babygirl*, an erotic film. Vincent Lindon took Best Actor for *The Quiet Son*, which explores extreme-right radicalism. Brady Corbet won Best Director for *The Brutalist*, a three-and-a-half-hour epic.

*I’m Still Here* won Best Screenplay, focusing on Brazil’s dictatorship. *April* received the Special Jury Award, an abortion drama. Films like *Joker: Folie à Deux* and *Maria* left empty-handed despite critical acclaim.

Venice marks the start of the awards season, often foreshadowing the Oscars. Eight of the last 12 best director Oscars were awarded to Venice debuts.
