In 2000, Commander Kevin Kregel led the Endeavour shuttle mission to create a 3D map of Earth. The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) utilized a 200-foot mast to gather elevation data. Despite facing technical hurdles—such as the mast's flexibility and frozen gas jets—innovative solutions, including a "fly-casting" maneuver, allowed the team to map over 80% of Earth's land.

SRTM's data remains crucial, supporting studies on wildfires, soil erosion, flood risks, and more. The mission's success was contingent on overcoming obstacles: cloud cover obscured many regions, aerial mapping was expensive, and political tensions restricted access. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) developed SRTM to penetrate clouds and map extensive areas in a single flight.

The SRTM instrument, now housed at the Smithsonian, features a sophisticated mast that folds like an accordion. In orbit, it extends to two-thirds the length of a football field. The mission's radar, mounted at the mast's end and inside the shuttle, provided continuous 3D views, faster and more precise than previous methods.

Key challenges included the mast bending under inertia and a frozen gas system. Engineer Bill Layman's "fly-casting" plan, inspired by fly-fishing, used shuttle thrusters to position the mast. This technique, both efficient and effective, ensured the mission's success.

SRTM's legacy continues, with its detailed maps still informing global research and applications.
