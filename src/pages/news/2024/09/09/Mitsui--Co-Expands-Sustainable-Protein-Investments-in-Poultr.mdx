Mitsui & Co., a Japanese trading giant, is making a significant bet on poultry and shrimp. President Kenichi Hori views these proteins as both economically and environmentally sustainable. By 2026, Mitsui aims to double its net profit from this sector to over 30 billion yen ($206 million).

Poultry and shrimp farming are considered more eco-friendly than beef or pork, producing far fewer greenhouse gases per kilogram. Mitsui plans to invest 140 billion yen by 2025, with 100 billion already allocated for acquisitions. The remaining 40 billion yen could be invested in Eastern Europe or Africa.

Mitsui’s strategy includes enhancing production and export capabilities. They’ve invested nearly 40 billion yen in India’s Sneha Farms, aiming to double its chicken output to 500,000 tonnes by 2029. For shrimp, Mitsui acquired a 20% stake in Ecuador’s Industrial Pesquera Santa Priscila, the world’s largest shrimp breeder.

Hori emphasizes wellness, seeing proteins not just as food but as contributors to health. Despite progress, the protein business is still in its early stages, contributing only 3% to Mitsui’s net profit. The competition for protein suppliers is intensifying, but Mitsui’s long-term relationships in Ecuador and India give them a competitive edge.

**Key Terms:**
- **Feed-efficient:** Requires less feed to produce the same amount of protein.
- **Greenhouse gases:** Gases like carbon dioxide that contribute to global warming.
- **Broiler chicken:** Chickens raised specifically for meat production.
