China's team set a new world record and won gold in the Paralympic 4×100m mixed relay in Paris.

The four team members: Zhou Guohua (blind), Wang Hao (handicapped), Wen Xiaoyan (cerebral palsy), and Hu Yang (racing wheelchair), each with different disabilities, formed the strongest team.

Hu Yang, the final leg, overtook the British competitor, finishing in 45.07 seconds.

Wen Xiaoyan: "We have over 1,400 possibilities; thank you to the scientific research team."

Zhou Guohua: "I gave up individual events for the team's victory."

Wang Hao, Hu Yang: "Winning gold is not the goal, but the process of striving."

The Paralympics showcase the most indomitable human spirit. A "jade" with flaws can still be a complete "king."
