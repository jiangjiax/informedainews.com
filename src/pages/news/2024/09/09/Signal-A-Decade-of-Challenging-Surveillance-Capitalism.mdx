Signal, the encrypted messaging app, turns ten. It started as a merger of two obscure apps, RedPhone and TextSecure. Now, it's a mainstream phenomenon, used by millions and integrated into platforms like WhatsApp.

Unlike Silicon Valley giants, Signal is a nonprofit. It’s funded by donations, free, ad-free, and collects minimal user data. Meredith Whittaker, Signal’s president since 2022, champions this model. A former Google critic, she cofounded the AI Now Institute to address AI ethics.

Whittaker sees Signal as a counter to surveillance capitalism. Her goal: secure long-term funding without corporate ties, ensuring Signal remains a privacy gold standard. She notes that privacy is now a valuable commodity, driving growth even in response to tech giants' missteps.

Whittaker argues that AI is a product of current surveillance models, not a separate phenomenon. She believes alternative tech models need capital and support to thrive, challenging the dominant business model.

Signal’s success suggests capitalism isn’t the only path forward in tech. It’s a beacon for a new ecosystem, free from surveillance and centralized control.
