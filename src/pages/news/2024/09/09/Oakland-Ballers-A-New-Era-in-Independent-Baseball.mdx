Paul Freedman, a serial entrepreneur, faced a personal crisis when his beloved Oakland A’s announced their move to Las Vegas. Instead of lamenting, he and partner Bryan Carmel founded the Oakland Ballers, an independent baseball team in the Pioneer League. This league, unlike minor leagues, isn’t tied to any MLB team.

Freedman approached the Ballers like a startup, raising $2 million and building the ballpark from scratch. He emphasized community as the core product, aiming to replicate the A’s legacy in Oakland. The Ballers introduced innovative features like impromptu Home Run Derbies for tied games and fan-controlled sports apps, fostering a unique fan experience.

The team also opened partial ownership to fans, raising over $1.235 million from 2,200 investors. This move aligned the team’s goals with its supporters, emphasizing shared joy and community.

Freedman’s venture into sports reflects his broader mission: creating businesses that positively impact the world. His journey from tech to baseball underscores the universal appeal of sports in uniting diverse communities.
