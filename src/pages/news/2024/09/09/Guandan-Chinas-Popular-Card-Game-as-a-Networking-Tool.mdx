Guandan, a card game originating in Jiangsu around 1980, has surged in popularity since 2020. With 140 million fans, it’s now a staple in China, especially among financiers. The game uses a double deck of 108 cards, played in teams of two. The goal is to empty your hand before the opponents.

The name “guandan” translates to “throwing eggs,” possibly referring to playing “bombs” of multiple cards. A 38-year-old Hubei native finds the game’s quick pace—40 to 50 minutes—and large hands appealing. Guandan fosters conversation, making it a social tool in business, particularly finance. Foreign investors are learning it to network.

Unlike poker, guandan isn’t linked to gambling, attracting younger players. Some schools have introduced it to teach strategy and adaptability. However, its popularity has led to issues: some workers play on the clock, prompting bans in state-owned enterprises. Critics question its place in education, fearing addiction.

Guandan’s rise reflects China’s evolving social landscape, blending tradition with modern networking. Its simplicity and social nature make it a unique cultural phenomenon.
