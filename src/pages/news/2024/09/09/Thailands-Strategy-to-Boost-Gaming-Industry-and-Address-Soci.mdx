Thailand is placing a significant bet on its gaming industry. The government plans to pass a new law next year, offering tax breaks and incentives to game developers. This move aims to transform Thailand into a regional hub for online games and e-sports.

The gaming sector already generates over 40 billion baht ($1.2 billion) annually. However, Thailand imports far more gaming content than it exports. The new law seeks to address this imbalance, boosting exports and creating more jobs.

The Digital Economy Promotion Agency (DEPA) is spearheading this initiative. They are working on the Game Industry Act, which will encompass everything from game development to related services and platforms. DEPA President Nuttapon Nimmanphatcharin emphasizes the need to balance growth with preventing negative impacts, such as game addiction.

Thailandâ€™s gaming industry enjoys strong government support. Grants and funding have been available since 2020. The recent Thailand International Game Showcase underscored the industry's potential.

Nonetheless, there are concerns. Over 3 million young Thais are addicted to online gambling, despite its illegality. The COVID-19 lockdowns exacerbated this issue, as gaming became a daily habit.

The DEPA is also collaborating with the Culture Ministry to monitor game content, aiming to prevent violence and criminal behavior.

In summary, Thailand views gaming as a cornerstone of its economic future. However, it must navigate carefully to avoid social challenges.
