The Legislative Affairs Commission of the National People's Congress recently held a press conference on the second draft revision of the Statistics Law, where spokesperson Wang Xiang provided a detailed introduction to the main amendments in the draft. The draft aims to strengthen the assessment and management of statistical work for leading officials, enhance the responsibility for preventing and combating statistical fraud and falsification, and increase provisions on prohibited behaviors.

The main amendments in the draft include:
1. Reflecting the new development concepts and improving the scientific and reasonable statistical standards and indicator systems.
2. Strengthening the construction of statistical informatization and promoting the deep integration of modern information technology with statistical work.
3. Refining the regulations on statistical supervision by incorporating the performance of statutory duties into the content of statistical supervision.
4. Enhancing the responsibility for preventing statistical fraud by including the prevention and punishment of statistical fraud into the scope of responsibilities for administrative and performance duties according to law.
5. Strengthening the sharing of statistical information by establishing and improving the statistical information sharing mechanism to enhance the efficiency of government statistics.

In recent years, statistical fraud and falsification have become serious issues, undermining the authenticity and accuracy of statistical data. The draft addresses this problem by adding provisions such as "including the prevention and punishment of statistical fraud into the scope of responsibilities for administrative and performance duties according to law" and "strengthening the assessment and management of statistical work for leading officials." These amendments further expand the scope of prohibited behaviors for relevant officials and increase the penalties for serious cases of inaccurate statistical data.

These amendments aim to establish and improve relevant accountability systems, enhance the rigid institutional constraints for preventing and combating statistical fraud, and ensure the comprehensive pursuit of legal responsibilities for all types of statistical fraud and falsification.
