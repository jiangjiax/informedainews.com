The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the Ministry of Commerce issued Decree No. 23 on September 8, 2024, announcing the Special Administrative Measures for Foreign Investment Access (Negative List) (2024 Edition), which will come into effect on November 1, 2024. The new version of the Negative List reduces the number of restrictive measures from 31 to 29, achieving "zero restrictions" on foreign investment in the manufacturing sector.

Key changes include:
- Removing the two items: "Printing of publications must be controlled by Chinese parties" and "Prohibition on investment in the application of processing technologies such as steaming, frying, roasting, and calcining of traditional Chinese medicine decoctions, as well as the production of products with confidential prescriptions."
- Areas not covered by the Negative List will be managed under the principle of equal treatment for domestic and foreign investment, granting foreign-invested enterprises national treatment.

The NDRC will further implement the pre-establishment national treatment plus negative list management system to ensure the timely implementation of new opening measures. At the same time, it will adhere to the principle of balancing openness and security, and diligently carry out risk control work.

**Explanation:**
- **Negative List**: A list of restricted areas for foreign investment.
- **National Treatment**: Foreign-invested enterprises enjoy the same treatment as domestic enterprises.

This policy adjustment aims to further relax foreign investment access, promote openness in sectors such as manufacturing, and ensure national security and economic stability.
