The Taipei City Department of Education has announced that starting from the 113rd academic year, it will expand the subsidy for menstrual products to female students in the first year of senior high schools. This initiative aims to promote menstrual equity, eliminate menstrual poverty, and provide more comprehensive support for adolescent female students. Since March 2022, Taipei has been the first in the nation to implement the "Junior High School Female Menstrual Product Subsidy Program," and in March 2023, the subsidy was extended to female students in the upper grades of elementary schools.

The Department of Education distributes electronic vouchers through the Cool Class Cloud platform each month, allowing students to redeem menstrual products at Hi-Life, 7-Eleven, and FamilyMart convenience stores. In 2023, a feature was developed for parents to claim the vouchers on behalf of their children, promoting gender equality within families.

Teacher Wang Junhao from Liu Gong Junior High School leads students in understanding menstrual equity through activities like holiday riddle games and menstrual huts. Principal Lin Tai-an of Zhongzheng Junior High School emphasizes that menstrual equity education needs to be promoted from multiple perspectives to become deeply ingrained in daily life.

This move by Taipei City aligns with international trends in menstrual equity and sets a new benchmark for gender equality education in Taiwan.
