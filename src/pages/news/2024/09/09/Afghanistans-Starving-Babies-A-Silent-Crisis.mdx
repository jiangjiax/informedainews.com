In Jalalabad, Afghanistan, a hospital ward is filled with starving babies. No cries or gurgles, just silence and the beeps of monitors. 3.2 million children suffer from acute malnutrition, a crisis worsened by decades of war, poverty, and the Taliban's rule.

Amina has lost six children; her seventh, Bibi Hajira, fights for life. The ward holds 18 toddlers in seven beds. Sana, three, shares a bed with Bibi Hajira; her mother died giving birth. Ilham, also three, is too small, his skin peeling. Asma, one, breathes heavily into an oxygen mask. Dr. Ghani predicts her death.

Seven hundred children have died in six months at this hospital. International funds, cut after the Taliban takeover, have crippled healthcare. Aid agencies provide temporary relief, but funding is dwindling. The Taliban calls for increased humanitarian aid, separate from political issues.

Despite the bleakness, timely treatment saves lives. Bibi Hajira, once fragile, is now recovering. More resources could save more children. The staff is committed, working tirelessly.

Malnutrition isn't the only killer. Pneumonia claims lives too. Umrah, six months old, battles severe pneumonia in the next ward. Her mother, Nasreen, weeps by her side.

The situation is dire. More aid is needed. Lives hang in the balance.
