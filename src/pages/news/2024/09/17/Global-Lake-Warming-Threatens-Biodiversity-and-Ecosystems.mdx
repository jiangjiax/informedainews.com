Global lakes are facing unprecedented warming threats, primarily driven by human-induced climate change. By the end of this century, tropical lakes will experience this extreme warming first, affecting both surface and bottom layers, posing a serious threat to biodiversity and ecosystems.

Lakes are renowned for their rich biodiversity and vital ecological functions, but rapid temperature increases are altering this. A recent study published in *Nature Geoscience* warns that if climate warming continues, widespread warming in both surface and bottom layers of global lakes will far exceed previous observations.

The study used advanced climate computer models, the Community Earth System Model, Version 2, to simulate lake temperatures over a span from 1850 to 2100. The model was run 100 times on South Korea's fastest computer to distinguish natural variability from human interference. The results show that by the end of this century, global lakes will face unprecedented climatic conditions, with tropical lakes experiencing this first.

The warming signal rapidly propagates downward, with subsurface layers of tropical lakes also experiencing unprecedented conditions. High-latitude lakes delay or prevent the appearance of unprecedented deep-layer climates through stratification.

The consequences of unprecedented lake climates are profound, potentially leading to severe future ecosystem disruptions. Given the limited migratory abilities of lake organisms, understanding the timing of the emergence of unprecedented conditions is crucial for the adaptation, planning, and climate mitigation of lake ecosystems.
