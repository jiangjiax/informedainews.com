Donald Trump lost a legal battle with Eddy Grant over using "Electric Avenue" in a 2020 campaign ad without permission. The 40-second clip, featuring Joe Biden in a railroad cart and a Trump-Pence train, was viewed over 13.7 million times before removal. Grant's lawyers sent a cease and desist letter, but the video stayed up until Grant sued on September 1.

In a Manhattan court, Judge John G Koeltl ruled Trump breached Grant's copyright, liable for damages and legal fees. Trump's lawyers argued fair use, but Koeltl rejected it. Brett Van Benthysen, one of Grant's lawyers, said, "It’s everything we asked for, 100%."

Brian Caplan, another lawyer, emphasized Grant's belief in artist rights and control over creative output. The court's decision, he said, helps others fight unauthorized use of sound recordings and musical compositions. Politicians, Caplan noted, are not above the law.

Grant's original lawsuit sought $300,000, but damages are yet to be determined. The case's success may encourage others, like the White Stripes and Isaac Hayes' estate, currently suing Trump for similar issues. Beyoncé also reportedly objected to Trump using her song "Freedom."

This ruling underscores the importance of respecting artists' rights, even for high-profile politicians. It sends a clear message: unauthorized use of creative works will be met with legal consequences.
