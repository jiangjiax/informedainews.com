The U.S. government has demanded that TikTok sell its operations within 90 days or face a ban. TikTok has filed a lawsuit, arguing that the move is unconstitutional. Today, the appeals court will hear arguments from both sides. The U.S. government is concerned about national security risks posed by TikTok's Chinese background, but TikTok denies any connection to the Chinese government. Efforts to reach a security agreement between the parties have previously broken down. The court's ruling remains pending.
