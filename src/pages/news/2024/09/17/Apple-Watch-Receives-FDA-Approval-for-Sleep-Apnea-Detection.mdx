FDA approves Apple Watch's sleep apnea detection.

The feature uses the watch's accelerometer to track subtle wrist movements linked to disrupted breathing patterns. Frequent disruptions over multiple nights may indicate sleep apnea. Users can view their data in the iPhone Health app, categorized as "elevated" or "not elevated."

Available on Apple Watch Series 10, 9, and Ultra, the tool aims to detect moderate to severe sleep apnea in adults not yet diagnosed.
