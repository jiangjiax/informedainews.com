EasyDMARC, an Armenian startup, just raised $20 million in a Series A round led by Radian Capital. The company simplifies email security using DMARC, a standard that prevents spam, spoofing, and phishing. Until recently, DMARC was overlooked, but Google and Yahoo's mandate for bulk email senders in 2023 changed that.

DMARC, or Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance, ensures emails are authentic. Despite its 2012 creation, many companies hadn't adopted it. EasyDMARC seized the opportunity, gaining over 83,000 customers in 130 countries since its 2018 launch.

Founder Gerasim Hovhannisyan noted the funding surge post-Google's announcement. Over 40 VCs showed interest, but Radian aligned best with EasyDMARC's culture and goals. The startup aims to expand in the U.S. and globally.

Competitors like Valimail, ProofPoint, and Minecast exist, but EasyDMARC's edge is simplicity. Hovhannisyan emphasizes ease of use, crucial for widespread adoption.

The startup's inception traces back to 2016, sparked by a phishing attack on a multi-billion-dollar company. Hovhannisyan found existing solutions complex, prompting him and co-founder Avag Arakelyan to create EasyDMARC.

Future standards, like PCI DSS for fintech companies, will further boost EasyDMARC. This funding highlights Armenia's growing startup ecosystem, known for tech innovation and attracting global investors.
