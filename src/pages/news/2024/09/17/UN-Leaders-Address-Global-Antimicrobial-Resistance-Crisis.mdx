World leaders convene at the UN to devise a global strategy against antimicrobial resistance (AMR). AMR refers to the ability of bacteria, viruses, and parasites to resist drugs, rendering treatments ineffective. This resistance threatens public health, as common infections could become untreatable.

The urgency is clear: without action, AMR could cause 10 million deaths annually by 2050. The UN aims to foster international cooperation, ensuring equitable access to effective antibiotics and promoting responsible use.

My take: This isn't just a medical issue; it's a global crisis. Leaders must act decisively, balancing innovation with ethical distribution. The clock is ticking.
