Seven candidates, including Japan's Watanabe Morinari, will compete for the presidency of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in March 2024. Watanabe, 65, is the first Japanese candidate for the role. He currently heads the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) and has been an IOC member since 2018. The election will be held in Greece, marking the end of Thomas Bach's 12-year term. Other contenders include Prince Feisal Al Hussein, Sebastian Coe, Kirsty Coventry, Johan Eliasch, David Lappartient, and Juan Antonio Samaranch. Notably, eight of the nine past IOC presidents were European, with one from the U.S.
