Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, faces two federal gun charges: possession by a felon and obliterated serial number. Combined, they carry a 20-year max and $500,000 fine.

Routh appeared in Florida court, shackled and nonchalant. His bond hearing is set for Sept. 23.

Secret Service agents fired shots near Trump's golf course after spotting a rifle in the tree line. Routh fled in a Nissan SUV. Agents found a loaded SKS-style rifle with an unreadable serial number.

Routh has prior felony convictions: a 2002 machine gun possession and 2010 stolen goods.

Trump was unharmed. Attorney General Merrick Garland pledged a thorough FBI investigation.

Vice President Kamala Harris condemned the violence. President Joe Biden suggested the Secret Service needs more support.
