In August 2024, Beijing's network watchdog processed over 1.5 million reports of illegal and harmful online content, a 4% increase from the previous month. During the Paris Olympics, the focus shifted to "sports fandom" issues, where fans' behavior became toxic. Over 4,600 accounts were penalized for attacking and insulting national athletes, with 301,000 harmful posts removed.

One case involved a user inciting hatred and spreading false information about athletes. The platform responded by deleting 92 posts, disbanding three groups, and banning four accounts. Another case saw an elderly person's request for help misrepresented online, leading to personal attacks. The platform swiftly removed the offending content. A third case highlighted a fake app mimicking a legitimate one, aiming to defraud users. The platform acted promptly to clear the misleading information.

The watchdog emphasizes the importance of providing clear evidence when reporting online misconduct. They encourage the public to use their platform to maintain a clean digital environment.

**Key Terms:**
- **"Sports fandom" issues:** Problematic behavior by sports fans, often involving excessive, negative, or obsessive behavior online.
- **"Harmful posts":** Content that violates community standards, such as hate speech, misinformation, or harassment.
