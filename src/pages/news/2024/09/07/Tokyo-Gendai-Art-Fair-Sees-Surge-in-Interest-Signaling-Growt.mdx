Tokyo Gendai, Japan’s nascent international art fair, saw a surge in interest this year. Pace Gallery, a major U.S. player, sold most of its Robert Longo pieces on the first day, surprising CEO Marc Glimcher. Buyers were mainly Japanese, a shift from the past.

The fair showcased works by Yoshitomo Nara, Ai Weiwei, and Hiroshi Senju, among others. It also included children’s workshops, fostering creativity.

Japan’s art market has long been small, accounting for just 1% of the global market. However, leading galleries like Pace, Ceysson and Benetiere, and Perrotin are now setting up in Tokyo, seeing potential.

Pace’s Tokyo gallery, its third in Asia, opened in September. Ceysson and Benetiere will follow in Ginza. Perrotin, with a Tokyo presence since 2017, aims to deepen engagement.

These moves reflect a change in Japan’s art scene. Decades of deflation stifled engagement with the global art world. Now, there’s a renewed interest, driven by young collectors and international galleries.

Glimcher notes the shift: “Artists want to have a show here.” Tokyo’s emergence as an art hub is promising, signaling a vibrant future for Japan’s art market.
