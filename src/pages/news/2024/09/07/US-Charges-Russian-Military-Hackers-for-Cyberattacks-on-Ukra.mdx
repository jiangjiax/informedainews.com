The U.S. Department of Justice indicted five Russian GRU officers and a civilian for cyberattacks on Ukraine, a U.S. agency in Maryland, and 26 NATO countries. The accused, led by GRU colonel Yuriy Denisov, allegedly orchestrated the WhisperGate attack, disguised as ransomware but intended to destroy data.

The group met at Cafe Shokoladnitsa in Moscow, planning their operations. The U.S. government claims significant access to their infrastructure, sending a clear message to the GRU: "We are onto you."

Targets included Ukraine's Ministry of Internal Affairs, State Treasury, and railways, as well as a Central European country's transportation network. The U.S. declined to name the Maryland-based agency hit.

The FBI, CISA, and international partners issued a cybersecurity advisory and offered $10 million rewards for information leading to the hackers' arrest. The U.S. government referred to the hackers as having "baby faces," a stark contrast to their destructive actions.

**Explanation:**
- **GRU:** Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate, a military intelligence agency.
- **WhisperGate:** A cyberattack designed to look like ransomware but aimed at destroying data.
- **CISA:** Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, a U.S. government agency focused on cybersecurity.
