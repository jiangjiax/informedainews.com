Xiang Mouhua, an economic crime suspect, colluded with others to defraud over 20 billion yuan through illegal fundraising and went on the run for four years, traveling through multiple countries. Recently, with the efforts of the "Fox Hunt" task force, Xiang Mouhua was extradited back to China from abroad. This marks the capture of the last major suspect in a significant illegal fundraising case in Dalian.

In 2021, the Dalian Municipal Public Security Bureau received a report alleging that a technology group had defrauded tens of millions of yuan. An investigation revealed that from 2015 to 2021, Xiang Mouhua and Wang某某 fabricated investment projects, defrauding over 36,000 people nationwide with an involved amount exceeding 20 billion yuan. Wang某某 has been sentenced to life imprisonment, while Xiang Mouhua fled overseas in 2020.

Under the command of the Ministry of Public Security's "Fox Hunt Office," the Liaoning public security economic investigation department established a task force to pursue the fugitive abroad. Over the past four years, Xiang Mouhua repeatedly evaded capture before finally being apprehended and extradited to China. At the extradition site, Xiang Mouhua stated, "The days in a foreign land were extremely difficult, and upon returning home, I will actively cooperate with the investigation."

This operation is another successful example of deepened law enforcement cooperation between China and relevant countries, demonstrating the Chinese police's determination to pursue economic crime suspects who have fled abroad. As of now, the "Fox Hunt 2024" special operation has captured nearly 800 overseas economic crime suspects from over 50 countries.
