Dimitri Coutya, 26, clinched his second gold at the Paris Paralympics, securing Britain's 42nd gold and surpassing the Tokyo tally. In the men's individual epee B final, Coutya bested Thailand's Visit Kingmanaw 15-10. This victory follows his earlier foil title.

Coutya's path to gold included wins over American Noah Hanssen and Italian Michele Massa. Despite initial struggles, he found form, crediting consistent training and support.

Piers Gilliver, defending his epee A title, fell to China's Sun Gang 15-12, earning silver. This marks GB's 100th medal in France, nearing their 100-140 target with two days left.

Coutya's triumph underscores resilience and teamwork. Gilliver's silver highlights the competitive edge in Paralympic fencing. Both athletes exemplify dedication and sportsmanship.
