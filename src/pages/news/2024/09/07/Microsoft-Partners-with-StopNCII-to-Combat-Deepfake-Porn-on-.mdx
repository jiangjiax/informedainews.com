Microsoft has partnered with StopNCII to combat deepfake porn on Bing. StopNCII allows victims to create a digital fingerprint, or "hash," of explicit images. This hash is then used to scrub the images from partner platforms. Bing joins Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and others in this effort.

Microsoft’s pilot removed 268,000 explicit images from Bing search results. Previously, user reporting was insufficient. Google, however, faces criticism for not partnering with StopNCII. In South Korea, Google users reported 170,000 links of unwanted sexual content since 2020.

Deepfake porn is widespread, affecting even minors. StopNCII’s tools are limited to adults. The U.S. lacks a federal law on AI deepfake porn, relying on state laws instead. San Francisco sued 16 "undressing" sites in August. Twenty-three states have passed laws against nonconsensual deepfakes, while nine have rejected proposals.
