Feishu, a collaboration and office platform, has recently launched several new tools centered around the theme of "efficiency." On September 4th, Feishu introduced its next-generation multidimensional table, low-code platform, and cross-border compliance solutions, aimed at helping enterprises reduce costs and increase efficiency.

Since its release in 2020, the multidimensional table has amassed 6 million monthly active users. In the past year alone, nearly 40 million tables have been created, processing over 10 billion records. In this latest update, the multidimensional table database can now accommodate up to 1 million rows per table, dashboards can aggregate data from 10 million rows, and complex data calculations take just 5 seconds.

The low-code platform, through the construction of full-code capabilities, has been implemented in multiple enterprises. For example, ByteDance has over a thousand active systems running weekly, adding 60 million new records daily and processing 20 million workflows, saving hundreds of millions of RMB in R&D costs. United Imaging Healthcare has built a complex CRM system through this platform, saving 1.5 million RMB in operational costs.

In response to the compliance challenges of the global market, Feishu supports multiple global data center nodes, distributed storage of employee data, and has passed several international authoritative certifications. Xie Xin, CEO of Feishu, emphasized that improving efficiency is not only a requirement for development but also a survival strategy.
