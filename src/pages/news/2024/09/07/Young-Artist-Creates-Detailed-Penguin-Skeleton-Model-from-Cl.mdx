A Japanese second-grader crafted a penguin skeleton model from clay, garnering over 2.7 million views online. Inspired by her older sister's creation of a giant salamander skeleton, the girl researched penguins during summer break. She independently sculpted the bones with minimal parental assistance. Her accomplishments include a 10-page illustrated report on penguins and a custom T-shirt design. The family shared these projects on social media, receiving widespread admiration.
