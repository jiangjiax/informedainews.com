Health Canada has ordered provinces to destroy existing COVID-19 vaccines targeting the XBB form of Omicron by September 1, 2024. These vaccines, based on a strain discovered in late 2021, are being phased out as new formulations targeting more recent Omicron subvariants, such as JN.1 or KP.2, are expected to be approved soon.

Ontario and other provinces plan to receive the new vaccines in October. British Columbia, however, will keep the old vaccines available until the new ones are approved, especially for those needing immediate vaccination, such as travelers or those visiting immunocompromised relatives.

Doctors and experts agree that while the old XBB vaccines aren't perfect, they still offer some protection. Health officials recommend updated boosters due to the virus's ongoing mutations and waning immunity over time.

Pharmacists in Ontario and Alberta report that the XBB vaccine is no longer available. Some, like Fady Salama in Toronto, were initially skeptical of the directive to discard the vaccines, questioning the logic of getting rid of something still useful.

COVID-19 activity remains high in some regions, with cases, hospitalizations, and deaths continuing to rise, though not at pandemic-peak levels. Dr. Donald Vinh from McGill University Health Centre notes that people are still getting sick, requiring medical attention and delaying other treatments.

Health Canada is expediting reviews of new vaccine submissions from Pfizer, Moderna, and Novavax for the fall campaign. The withdrawal of the old vaccines is part of standard practice, similar to annual influenza vaccines. A federal reserve of XBB vaccines will be maintained for unexpected public health needs.

Marie-Andree Lajoie, an Ottawa resident planning an overseas trip, had her booster appointment canceled, highlighting the transition period's impact on public access to vaccines.
