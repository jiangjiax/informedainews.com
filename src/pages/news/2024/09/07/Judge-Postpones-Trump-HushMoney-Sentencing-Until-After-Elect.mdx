A New York judge, Juan Merchan, postponed Donald Trump’s sentencing on hush-money charges until November 26. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, requested the delay to avoid sentencing before the election. His lawyers argued there was insufficient time for appeals, citing a recent Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity.

Merchan recognized the complexities, noting that the election and the ruling made a timely sentencing challenging. Prosecutors did not object to the delay, seeing it as a sign of support. Trump faces up to four years in prison but could receive a lesser sentence or probation.

The trial was contentious. Trump’s attacks on Merchan and others led to a gag order. The delay means voters won’t see the sentence before casting their ballots. Democrats would use it to highlight Trump’s unfitness; Republicans would portray it as political persecution.

Legal analyst Katie Phang criticized the delay, suggesting it fuels doubts about the case’s integrity.
