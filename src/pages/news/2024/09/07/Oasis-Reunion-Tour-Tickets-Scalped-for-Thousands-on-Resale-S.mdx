Touts are scalping Oasis reunion tour tickets, listing over 4,500 on resale sites like Viagogo, StubHub, and Gigsberg. These tickets, originally bought in breach of gig rules, are now priced in the thousands. The band has threatened to cancel any tickets bought through such platforms.

Dynamic pricing by Ticketmaster, which hiked ticket prices by hundreds of pounds, has sparked outrage and a competition watchdog investigation. Touts are holding back more tickets, waiting for the Ticketmaster controversy to fade before selling.

Resale isn't illegal, but using unlawful methods—like speculative selling, where tickets are advertised without being owned—can land touts in jail. The Competition and Markets Authority forces resale platforms to reveal traders selling 100+ tickets annually.

Some touts, like Ricardo Junior from Brazil, claim to have dozens of tickets for major shows. Others, like Rojan Rana, admit to speculative selling. Younger touts, known as "sneaker kids," started by cornering the trainer market before moving into tickets.

The government is considering banning ticket resale for profit, mirroring Ireland's approach. The murky world of secondary ticketing, where savvy traders can make thousands per show, raises concerns about illegal practices and exploitation of fans.
