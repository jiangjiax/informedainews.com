Professor Zhang Yi, Director of the Biocellular Therapy Center at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, has dedicated 35 years to research in cellular and immunotherapy. His team has achieved significant results in the field of tumor immunotherapy, filing and obtaining multiple patents, with a transformation value exceeding 80 million RMB.

Recently, Professor Zhang Yi's team discovered that the expression of phospholipid phosphatase PLPP1 in tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells is reduced, leading to T cell intolerance to unsaturated fatty acids and triggering ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is a novel form of cell death associated with increased unsaturated phospholipids.

The study revealed that PLPP1 expression is regulated by the PD-1 signaling pathway, and its levels are closely related to the efficacy of PD-1 monoclonal antibody therapy. Enhancing PLPP1 expression can strengthen T cell anti-tumor functions and improve the efficacy of PD-1 monoclonal antibodies.

The team is currently conducting translational research, including observing the impact of PLPP1 on the persistence of CAR-T cells and the cytotoxic effects of T cells overexpressing PLPP1 on different tumor cells. Additionally, they are screening for PLPP1 agonists to enhance the effectiveness of PD-1 monoclonal antibody therapy.

This research provides new targets and strategies for optimizing tumor immunotherapy, highlighting the critical role of cellular metabolism in immunotherapy.
