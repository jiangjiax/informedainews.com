The United States and India are strengthening their semiconductor cooperation, with President Biden and Prime Minister Modi announcing the establishment of an advanced chip manufacturing facility in West Bengal, India. The facility will produce infrared, gallium nitride (GaN), and silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductors, focusing on sensing, communication, and national security applications. This initiative aims to foster technological collaboration between the two countries and create job opportunities.

The Indian government is supporting the industry through the "Semiconductor Mission of India," which includes attracting investment, research and development, and infrastructure development. Odisha also plans to set up a second silicon carbide factory with an expected capacity of 72,000 wafers per year, targeting the electric vehicle and renewable energy sectors.

India is actively pushing for the development of its chip manufacturing industry, and German company Infineon has expressed interest in collaboration. Discussions among the three parties have revolved around the development of power semiconductors, with Infineon considering transferring some of its operations to India.

**Notes:**
- **Gallium Nitride (GaN):** A semiconductor material used for efficient power conversion.
- **Silicon Carbide (SiC):** Another semiconductor material suitable for high-temperature and high-frequency applications.
- **MOSFET:** Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor, used for electronic switching and amplification.
