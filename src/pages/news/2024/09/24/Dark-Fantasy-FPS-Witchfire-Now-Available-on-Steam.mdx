"Witchfire," a dark fantasy first-person shooter, has ended its Epic Games Store exclusivity and is now available on Steam. It is priced at 125 RMB for its initial launch in China. Players take on the role of an immortal witch hunter named Preyer, using firearms and spells to hunt down witches.

The game initially focuses more on gameplay and atmosphere, with the story and lore set to expand in future updates. The early access phase is expected to last 9 to 12 months, with each update introducing new content and improvements.

The storytelling style of the game evokes comparisons to Tolkien and Hemingway.
