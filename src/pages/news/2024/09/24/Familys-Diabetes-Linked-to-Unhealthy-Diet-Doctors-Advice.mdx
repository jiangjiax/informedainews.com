Diabetes affects many, particularly those over 60. One family, all diagnosed, shared a common diet: heavy on fried rice and noodles, drenched in chili sauce and soy. Each meal was packed with sugar, lacking in vegetables and protein. This resulted in sky-high blood sugar levels and constant hunger, creating a vicious cycle.

Dr. Yang recommends three solutions: adjust the diet, be more active, and manage stress. Reduce carb intake, increase fiber and healthy fats, and incorporate exerciseâ€”strength training and cardio. Simple changes can break the cycle, potentially saving lives.
