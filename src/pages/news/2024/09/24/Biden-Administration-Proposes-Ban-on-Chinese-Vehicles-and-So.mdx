Biden's administration plans to ban Chinese software and hardware in U.S. vehicles, citing national security risks. The move aims to prevent data collection and potential remote control by foreign adversaries, particularly China and Russia.

The proposed regulation would bar Chinese cars from the U.S. market and force existing automakers to remove Chinese components. This includes self-driving car testing by Chinese firms.

Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo warns of extreme scenarios where foreign adversaries could control U.S. vehicles, causing crashes and roadblocks.

The U.S. has already imposed steep tariffs on Chinese imports, including electric vehicles. Raimondo emphasizes acting before Chinese and Russian components become widespread in the U.S. automotive sector.

Nearly all newer cars are "connected," with onboard network hardware for internet access. The proposal would ban existing Chinese light-duty vehicles but allow for specific exemptions.

White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan highlights evidence of China's malware in critical U.S. infrastructure. The Chinese Embassy in Washington criticizes the move, urging a level playing field for all companies.

The proposal calls for software prohibitions by the 2027 model year and hardware bans by 2030. The public has 30 days to comment, with finalization expected by January 20.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, representing major automakers, warns that changing hardware and software would take time. They note that components are developed globally, including in China, but cannot detail the prevalence of Chinese components in U.S. models.
