Li Jiaqi, the e-commerce giant, crossed over to participate in "Swordsmen 4," where he was eliminated in the fifth round but won acclaim. He stood out in the show through hard work and wisdom, transforming from "immediate elimination" to "worthy of promotion" in just two months. Li Jiaqi explained his cross-over reason: "I want to experience different worlds and explore more possibilities." This reflects the trend of top anchors seeking change.

During the same period, anchors like Dong Yuhui and Crazy Yang Ge were embroiled in controversies, while Li Jiaqi improved his image through variety shows. He balanced live streaming and the program, showcasing his multifaceted talents and winning audience approval. His assistant Wang Wang also actively participated in variety shows, demonstrating the team's efforts.

Mei Wan Company has a long-term layout, with Li Jiaqi's "alter egos" growing on different platforms. The Naiwa family, Wang Wang, and others expanded their influence, with AI digital human technology applied in the "All Girls" live stream. Qi Zhenbo, founder of Mei Wan, stated that in the future, "Li Jiaqi" will not only be a live stream but also a content-driven channel brand, aiming to be a "century-old shop."

In the changing e-commerce industry, Li Jiaqi and Mei Wan's strategies show the courage and confidence of leaders. They not only respond to challenges but also create the future.
