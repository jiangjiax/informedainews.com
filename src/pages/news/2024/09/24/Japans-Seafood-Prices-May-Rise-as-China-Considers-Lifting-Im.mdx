Japan’s seafood industry faces a price hike as China considers lifting its import ban. The ban, imposed in 2023 over Fukushima’s treated wastewater, slashed exports and prices. Scallops, abalone, and yellowtail saw significant drops.

The Japanese government responded with subsidies and automation. Scallop exports to the U.S. and Canada surged, but overall exports fell. Prices are now stabilizing.

China’s potential reversal could boost high-end seafood prices. Despite the ban, Japanese food remains popular in China. Japan aims to triple seafood exports by 2030 but faces supply challenges due to declining wild catches and rising costs.
