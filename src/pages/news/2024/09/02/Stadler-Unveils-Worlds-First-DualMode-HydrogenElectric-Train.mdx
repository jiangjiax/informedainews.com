Stadler Rail, a company renowned for setting Guinness World Records with its hydrogen trains, has unveiled a new model: RS Zero. This train operates with zero CO2 emissions, powered by either hydrogen or batteries, or a combination of both. It is designed for branch lines, where 38% of Germany's railways remain non-electrified.

The RS Zero can travel 2803 kilometers on a single tank of hydrogen, thanks to its lightweight design. It is versatile, switching to overhead cables when available. The prototype, showcased at InnoTrans 2024 in Berlin, comes in single or double-headed configurations, with ranges of 700 and 1000 kilometers respectively.

Battery-only versions have shorter ranges, from 80 to 180 kilometers. Both types max out at 120 km/h. The train features low-floor access, a multi-functional area for bikes, and 98% renewable materials in its construction. Climate control uses eco-friendly coolant.

Stadler's move caters to both environmental and operational needs, offering a practical solution for modern rail transport.
