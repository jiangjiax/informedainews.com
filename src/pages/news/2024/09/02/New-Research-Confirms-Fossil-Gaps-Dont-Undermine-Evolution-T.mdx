New research by Dutch and British scientists shows that gaps in the fossil record do not cripple our understanding of evolution. Fossils are crucial, but not every creature becomes one. Many are lost to erosion before discovery.

Niklas Hohmann at Utrecht University led the study. They found that regular gaps, not just incompleteness, shape how we piece together evolutionary history. Think of a movie: missing every frame still lets you follow the plot.

This eases concerns since Darwin's time. He worried that missing fossils would obscure gradual changes his theory predicted. Now, knowing where and why gaps occur helps us reconstruct ancient evolution with new precision.

The team used computer simulations to test how well we can recover evolutionary patterns from incomplete fossil data. Results show that despite gaps, fossil evidence supports our grasp of evolutionary patterns and rates.
