Tech giants Apple and NVIDIA are considering investing in OpenAI, the AI company whose valuation is expected to surpass $100 billion. Microsoft, an existing shareholder of OpenAI, is also contemplating increasing its investment. OpenAI's valuation has significantly risen from $800 billion in February of this year.

Apple plans to integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT technology into its iOS 18 system, initially launching on the iPhone 15 Pro. Siri will be able to forward complex requests to OpenAI's models, and ChatGPT will also be integrated into Apple's writing tools.

NVIDIA is also considering investing in OpenAI, although OpenAI might seek to reduce its reliance on NVIDIA products. OpenAI is in talks with suppliers like Broadcom to develop custom machine learning accelerators.

OpenAI's ChatGPT currently has over 200 million weekly active users, and 92% of the Fortune 500 companies use its products. CEO Sam Altman stated that OpenAI's tools have had a substantial impact in fields like healthcare and education.

With the involvement of giants like Apple and NVIDIA, OpenAI's technological prowess and market position could be further solidified, but this might also spark discussions about technological monopolies and the diversity of innovation. The rapid development of AI technology and the expanding scope of its applications suggest that similar investments and collaborations will continue to increase in the future.
