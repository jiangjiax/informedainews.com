CCTV has exposed the issue of excessive sulfur in goji berries, with reporters delving into the processing sites and being overwhelmed to the point of tears.

Goji berries, representative of the concept of food as medicine, are widely used in foods, beverages, and health supplements. These seemingly plump and bright red berries, however, conceal food safety risks. Merchants in Golmud, Qinghai, and Jingyuan, Gansu, have been illegally using sodium metabisulfite and industrial sulfur to enhance color and appearance, allowing even inferior goji berries to fetch good prices.

Sodium metabisulfite, a chemical agent used to enhance color in goji berry processing, is explicitly prohibited by regulations. Industrial sulfur, which contains a high amount of arsenic and is harmful to human health, is not allowed in food processing. Reporters found that merchants were knowingly violating the law for profit.

The goji berry industry, originally a local specialty aimed at increasing farmers' income, has been tarnished by illegal processing, resulting in a loss of industry credibility and ultimately not worth the cost. Addressing the industry's痛点 is the pressing matter at hand.
