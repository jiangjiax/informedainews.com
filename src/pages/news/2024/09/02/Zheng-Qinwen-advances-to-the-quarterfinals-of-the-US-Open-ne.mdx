Zheng Qinwen, a Chinese tennis player, defeated Croatia's Vekic in the women's singles round of 16 at the US Open, advancing to the quarterfinals for the second time. Previously, Zheng's best performance at the US Open was reaching the quarterfinals last year. In this match, she endured a grueling three-set battle, ultimately winning 2-1.

Zheng Qinwen had a 2-1 head-to-head record against Vekic before this match. In the deciding set, Zheng displayed strong form, securing the victory with a 6-2 score. After the match, she thanked the fans in attendance and expressed her enjoyment of the competition.

Next, Zheng Qinwen will face Belarus' Sabalenka, aiming for a "revenge." Last year's US Open and this year's Australian Open saw Zheng defeated by Sabalenka. This rematch holds promise for Zheng to break through.

The US Open, officially known as the United States Open Tennis Championships, is one of the four Grand Slam tournaments in tennis, held annually in New York. Zheng Qinwen's performance is not only a personal breakthrough but also another showcase of Chinese tennis on the international stage.
