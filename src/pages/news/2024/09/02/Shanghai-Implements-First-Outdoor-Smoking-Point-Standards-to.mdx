Shanghai has released the country's first standard specification for outdoor smoking areas, set to take effect on September 1, 2024. Led by the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission and drafted jointly by multiple institutions, the standard aims to regulate the setup and management of outdoor smoking areas to reduce the harm of secondhand smoke on public health.

The standard outlines requirements for the location, facilities, and signage of outdoor smoking areas, and specifies daily management responsibilities. Shanghai plans to establish 300 demonstration sites by the end of the year, covering commercial districts, sports venues, parks, and other public spaces.

This move not only fills a domestic gap but also has innovative significance internationally. By setting up outdoor smoking areas, smokers are guided to avoid crowds, reducing the phenomenon of "wandering smoke" and protecting non-smokers from secondhand smoke.

Additionally, smoking areas will provide information on quitting services to help smokers quit. The Shanghai Municipal Health Commission stated that the standard offers professional guidance for the reasonable setup and management of outdoor smoking areas,有助于 enhance the city's refined management of smoking control, and promote the construction of a healthy city.
