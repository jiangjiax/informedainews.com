Jinan's Huanggang Road Yellow River Crossing Tunnel project has commenced, marking the world's largest underwater shield tunneling endeavor. The tunnel spans 5,755 meters in total, with a critical section of 3,290 meters. It connects to the G309 interchange, bridging both sides of the Yellow River.

The "Mountain River" shield machine, with a diameter of 17.5 meters, is equipped with cutting-edge technology. The tunnel features a single-bore double-deck structure, with three lanes in each direction, saving space and reducing costs. It has a clear height of 4.2 meters, accommodating special vehicle requirements.
