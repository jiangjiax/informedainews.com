Changan Automobile, a major Chinese carmaker, has recently made a significant investment in Tai-Blue New Energy, a startup focused on the development of solid-state batteries. Solid-state batteries replace the liquid electrolytes in traditional lithium batteries with solid electrolytes, enhancing energy density and safety stability, and are expected to enable electric vehicles to achieve a range of over 1000 kilometers.

Tai-Blue New Energy, though low-profile, has already secured multiple rounds of funding from investors including Country Garden Venture Capital and CICC Capital. Its core technologies include self-developed lithium-oxygen polymer composite materials and interfacial softening techniques, which address issues of high internal resistance and poor interfacial contact in solid-state batteries.

Changan's move not only provides financial support to Tai-Blue but also signals the accelerated application of solid-state battery technology in the automotive industry. Tai-Blue plans to achieve mass production of all-solid-state batteries by 2026, with current semi-solid-state batteries nearing the cost of liquid batteries.

The revolutionary potential of solid-state batteries is akin to the disruption brought by the advent of smartphones, potentially reshaping the product forms and market landscape of new energy vehicles. Changan's investment is a proactive move in anticipating future technological trends and a bid for defining industry standards.

Chongqing, as a major hub for the automotive industry in western China, stands to benefit greatly. The successful transformation of Changan, coupled with the rise of Tai-Blue New Energy, positions Chongqing prominently in the landscape of China's automotive industry ascendancy.
