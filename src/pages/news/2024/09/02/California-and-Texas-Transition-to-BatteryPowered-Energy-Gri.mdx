California's grid now runs on 20% solar power, thanks to 1.9 million solar panels and 120,000 batteries. This leap in storage capacity, from 770 to 10,000 megawatts, cut natural gas use by half in April. Batteries are replacing fossil fuels, powering millions of homes and pushing California closer to its 100% renewable energy goal by 2045. Texas follows suit, with batteries supplying 4% of its grid. This shift signals a new era in energy, where batteries challenge gas and coal dominance.
