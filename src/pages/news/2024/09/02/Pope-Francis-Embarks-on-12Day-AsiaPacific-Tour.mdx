Pope Francis sets off on a 12-day Asia-Pacific tour, visiting Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, East Timor, and Singapore. This journey, originally planned for 2020 but delayed due to the pandemic, underscores Asia's strategic importance for the Catholic Church.

The tour, spanning over 20,000 miles, includes over 40 events. Francis's first stop is Indonesia, where he will visit Jakarta's main mosque and tour the "Tunnel of Friendship," a symbol of religious harmony linking the mosque to the Catholic cathedral. He will also meet with Indonesia's president and hold a mass for 80,000 people.

In Papua New Guinea, Francis will address climate change, highlighting rising sea levels and severe weather events. His visit to East Timor will include a mass at the seaside esplanade where Pope John Paul II once celebrated. This stop may force Francis to confront the clergy sexual abuse scandal involving Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo.

The final stop is Singapore, part of the Vatican's efforts to improve ties with China. The recent recognition of Tianjin bishop Melchior Shi Hongzhen by China is seen as a positive step in this direction.

This tour, despite health challenges, showcases Francis's commitment to environmental issues, interfaith dialogue, and the growth of the Catholic Church in Asia.
