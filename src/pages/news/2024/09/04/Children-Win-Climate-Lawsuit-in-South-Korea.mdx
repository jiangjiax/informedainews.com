Children won a climate lawsuit in South Korea. The court ruled that the government's climate law was insufficient. Now, the government must draft new, improved laws to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Hannah Kim, eight, and Jeah Han, 12, were among the plaintiffs. They argue that climate change impacts their lives, such as typhoons causing school closures. They aspire for the world to improve.

Hyunjung Yoon, 19, is a dedicated climate activist. She emphasizes that the government should safeguard people's rights, not merely meet targets. She views the lawsuit as a pivotal moment.

The children yearn for a safer world. They reject a society where only the strong thrive. They advocate for everyone's well-being.

Jeah simply wishes for the world to remain as it is now.
