Eleven people, including Bella Nilsson, once dubbed the “queen of trash,” are on trial in Sweden. They're accused of illegal toxic waste dumping, the country’s largest environmental crime case.

Think Pink, the recycling company at the center, allegedly buried waste in 21 locations, risking human health and the environment. Nilsson and her ex-husband, Thomas, deny the charges.

The trial, expected to last nine months, involves serious environmental and economic crimes. Think Pink’s pink construction bags were ubiquitous in Stockholm from 2018-2020. The company collapsed in 2020 after the arrests.

Police found high levels of arsenic, dioxins, and other toxins. Some dumps caught fire, one lasting months. Prosecutors claim Think Pink used falsified documents to deceive authorities and profit.

Damages are estimated at 260 million SEK (£19 million), mostly from municipalities cleaning up the waste. The case highlights how people often ignore the origins of cheap services.

Nilsson, now named Fariba Vancor, insists the company followed the law and was framed by rivals. Her lawyer supports her claims.
