Zheng Qinwen, the rising star of Chinese tennis, is challenging the US Open quarterfinals as an Olympic gold medalist. Her opponent, Sabalenka from Belarus, is a renowned player who has reached the Grand Slam quarterfinals ten times in the past five years, demonstrating remarkable consistency.

Zheng Qinwen has been impressive at this year's US Open, with a powerful serve and nearly twice as many Ace balls as her opponent. Her matches are filled with resilience, often coming back from behind to win. However, facing Sabalenka, Zheng needs to strengthen her second serve, as Sabalenka's return of second serve is highly effective, posing a challenge to Zheng.

Since her loss in last year's US Open final, Sabalenka has improved both tactically and psychologically. She emphasizes enjoying leisure time during important tournaments to maintain mental strength.

Although Zheng Qinwen has lost both previous encounters against Sabalenka, she is full of anticipation, viewing Sabalenka as a mountain she must climb to become a top player. This match is not only a test of skill but also a battle of psychology and willpower.
