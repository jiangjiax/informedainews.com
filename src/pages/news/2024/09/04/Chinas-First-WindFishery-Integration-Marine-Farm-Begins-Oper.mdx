"Fuxi No. 1" has been put into production in Shanwei, Guangdong, with an annual fish production of approximately 900 tons and a value of 54 million yuan. The project is located at the heart of an offshore wind farm, with a breeding water volume of 63,000 cubic meters. It is designed to withstand typhoons up to level 17 and incorporates anti-collision and strong anti-corrosion technologies. It explores new models of deep-water aquaculture and sustainable marine practices, promoting a virtuous ecological cycle. This marks a new milestone for China's marine ranching and sets a new benchmark for green development in the global marine economy.

Marine ranching: Offshore aquaculture facilities that simulate natural environments for fish farming.
Wind-fishery integration: Combining wind power generation with marine aquaculture to achieve symbiosis between energy and fisheries.
