Nvidia, an AI chipmaker, faces scrutiny from the U.S. Department of Justice. They received a subpoena, a legal demand for evidence. The DOJ suspects Nvidia of antitrust violations, specifically hindering supplier switching and penalizing non-exclusive chip users.

This follows criticism from progressive groups, who argue Nvidia's hardware-software bundling stifles innovation and locks in customers. France's antitrust body also plans to charge Nvidia for similar practices.

Antitrust laws aim to prevent market monopolies, ensuring fair competition.
