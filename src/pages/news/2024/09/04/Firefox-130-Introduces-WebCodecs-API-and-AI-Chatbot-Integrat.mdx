Firefox 130 rolls out with key upgrades:

- Enhanced local translation.
- Faster Android page loads.
- WebCodecs API for detailed audio/video control on desktops.

This update also integrates third-party AI chatbots, like ChatGPT, directly into Firefox via a sidebar. Users can access AI services without switching tabs or apps.
