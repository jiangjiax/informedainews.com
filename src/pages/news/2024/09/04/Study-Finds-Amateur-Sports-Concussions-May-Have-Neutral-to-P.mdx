A new extensive study examined over 15,000 individuals aged between 50 and 90. It revealed that experiencing a concussion in amateur sports does not appear to have long-term detrimental effects on the brain. In fact, it might even offer some benefits.

Researchers from Exeter, Sydney, Oxford, and Harvard investigated how frequently these individuals sustained head injuries, whether through sports or other accidents. Those who suffered concussions in sports performed slightly better on brain tests compared to those who did not.

This does not imply that sustaining a head injury is beneficial. It merely suggests that the positive aspects of participating in sports might counteract the negative effects. However, this finding pertains to amateurs, not professionals, who experience significantly more and severe impacts.

Therefore, while sports like rugby carry risks, the study indicates that they might not be as harmful as previously thought for average individuals. Nonetheless, we must remain cautious regarding children and professionals, whose brain development and resilience differ significantly.
