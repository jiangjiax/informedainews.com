On May 10, a massive solar storm illuminated the sky with the northern lights, visible even in South America. This event, caused by three coronal mass ejections, was one of the most powerful in 500 years.

Behind the spectacle, scientists at NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center were on high alert. An internal memo described the geomagnetic storm as "extreme" and potentially catastrophic if not managed properly.

Solar Cycle 25, ongoing until 2030, has seen unexpected activity, with sunspots triggering powerful solar flares. These flares disrupted high-frequency radio communications, crucial for trans-oceanic aviation.

A day before the event, the Space Weather Prediction Center alerted the North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC), giving 3,000 utility companies six hours to prepare. They also informed FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.

The storm disrupted navigation, power grids, aviation, and satellite operations, highlighting the vulnerability of modern infrastructure to space weather. Despite mitigation efforts, areas for improvement in preparedness and response were noted.

Coronal mass ejection: A massive burst of solar wind and magnetic fields from the Sun's corona.
High-frequency radio: Radio waves used for long-distance communication, essential for aviation.
