Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen faced Senate scrutiny over the high prices of Wegovy and Ozempic. These drugs, used for weight loss and diabetes, are significantly cheaper in Europe. For instance, Ozempic costs $59 in Germany, while in the U.S., it’s nearly $969 per month.

Senator Bernie Sanders accused Novo Nordisk of "ripping off" Americans, noting the company’s $50 billion in sales, mostly from the U.S. Sanders revealed that generic drug CEOs could sell a version of Ozempic for under $100 a month.

Jørgensen argued that PBMs (pharmacy benefit managers) control drug prices and that lowering Novo Nordisk’s prices could reduce insurance coverage. He cited the example of Levemir insulin, which lost coverage after a price cut.

Despite this, Jørgensen pledged to work with lawmakers and PBMs to address affordability issues. The hearing highlighted the complex U.S. healthcare system and the need for policy solutions to ensure drug accessibility and affordability.
