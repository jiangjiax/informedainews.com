A cluster of storms south of the Cayman Islands is expected to strengthen into Hurricane Helene by Wednesday, heading toward the Gulf Coast. Forecasters warn it could become a major hurricane, possibly a Category 4. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency in 41 counties.

The storm is fueled by warm sea temperatures and favorable atmospheric conditions, including moist air and light upper-level winds. It’s moving northwest at 6 mph with sustained winds of 35 mph.

Hurricane watches are in effect for parts of Cuba and Mexico, with tropical storm warnings for Grand Cayman and eastern Mexico. Florida’s Lower Keys and Dry Tortugas are under a tropical storm watch.

Heavy rainfall, up to 12 inches in isolated areas, is forecast for western Cuba, the Cayman Islands, and the eastern Yucatán Peninsula. Flash and river flooding are expected in the southeast U.S. starting Wednesday.

Storm surge of up to 4 feet is predicted for parts of Cuba and Mexico. The Cayman Islands closed schools due to expected flooding.

Helene would be the eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which has been predicted to be above average due to record-warm ocean temperatures.
