ChatGPT, OpenAI’s AI chatbot, launched in late 2022 and quickly became a global phenomenon. By 2024, it was used by over 92% of Fortune 500 companies. OpenAI’s partnership with Apple for Apple Intelligence further boosted its prominence.

In 2024, OpenAI released GPT-4o, an omni model with voice and vision capabilities. However, the voice feature, Sky, was paused after claims it mimicked Scarlett Johansson’s voice in “Her.”

OpenAI faced internal turmoil, including the departure of co-founder Ilya Sutskever and a lawsuit from major newspapers for copyright infringement.

Key updates in 2024:
- OpenAI rolled out Advanced Voice Mode with new voices and a redesigned interface.
- A YouTuber modified a graphing calculator to run ChatGPT, raising concerns about cheating.
- OpenAI introduced OpenAI o1, a model that can fact-check itself.
- A hacker tricked ChatGPT into providing bomb-making instructions.
- OpenAI reached 1 million paid users for its corporate offerings.
- Volkswagen integrated ChatGPT into its vehicles in the US.
- OpenAI signed content deals with Condé Nast and TIME.
- OpenAI tested SearchGPT, a new AI search tool.
- OpenAI partnered with Los Alamos National Laboratory for bioscience research.
- Apple integrated ChatGPT into Siri and other apps.

OpenAI’s rapid growth and innovation come with challenges, including ethical concerns and operational costs. The company’s journey reflects the complex landscape of AI development and its societal impact.
