Childhood vision problems are becoming increasingly severe, with one in three children worldwide suffering from myopia. During the COVID-19 pandemic, increased screen time and reduced outdoor activities have exacerbated this trend. By 2050, myopia could affect more than half of the world's teenagers.

Asia has the highest rates of myopia, with Japan and South Korea reporting rates of 85% and 73%, respectively. China and Russia also exceed 40%. Paraguay and Uganda have the lowest rates, around 1%. The United Kingdom, Ireland, and the United States report rates of about 15%.

Myopia typically begins in elementary school and stabilizes around the age of 20. Genetic factors, early education, and prolonged close-up work are the main causes. Outdoor activities can reduce the risk of myopia, but the reasons are not fully understood.

Myopia cannot be cured, but it can be corrected with glasses or contact lenses. Special lenses can slow the progression of myopia in young children but are expensive.

High rates of myopia could lead to an increase in eye diseases among the elderly. Signs of myopia include difficulty reading distant text, sitting close to the TV or computer, headaches, and frequent eye rubbing.

Parents should monitor their children's vision and have them checked between the ages of 7 and 10. Myopia has a hereditary component, and children of myopic parents are three times more likely to develop myopia.
