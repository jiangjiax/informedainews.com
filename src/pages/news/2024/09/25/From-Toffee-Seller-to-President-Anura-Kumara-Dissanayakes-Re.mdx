Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Sri Lanka's new president, rose from poverty in Thambuttegama, a village where wild elephants still forage at night. His father was a laborer, and as a schoolboy, Dissanayake sold toffees to help his family. After high school, he adopted the name "Aravinda" to hide his involvement with the Marxist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) movement, which rebelled against the Sri Lankan state.

Dissanayake's cousin, Sunil, was killed for his JVP ties, and Dissanayake himself faced threats, dropping out of the University of Peradeniya. He later graduated from the University of Kelaniya with a degree in physical science. His university roommate noted his deep reading of Russian literature, including works by Gorky, Pushkin, and Chekhov.

Dissanayake's political career began with the JVP, rising through its ranks and helping transform it into the National People's Power (NPP) alliance. The NPP attracted technocrats and academics, broadening the JVP's appeal. After the 2004 election, Dissanayake became minister of agriculture, livestock, land, and irrigation.

His victory in the recent presidential election was rooted in the JVP's grassroots outreach and a social media blitz. Dissanayake promised to build confidence among those who didn't support him, drawing on his humble beginnings to bridge divides.

**Insights:**
Dissanayake's journey from a toffee seller to president is a testament to resilience and strategic political maneuvering. His ability to balance diverse interests within the NPP while staying true to his Marxist roots showcases a pragmatic approach to leadership. His conciliatory tone post-election suggests a willingness to unify a fractured nation, leveraging his personal story to connect with a broad audience.
