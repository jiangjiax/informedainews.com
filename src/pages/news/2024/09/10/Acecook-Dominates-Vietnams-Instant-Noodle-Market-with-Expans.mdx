HANOI — Vietnam’s instant noodle market is booming, led by Japanese producer Acecook. Last year, Acecook sold 3.3 billion servings, capturing 40% of the market. This volume is nearly 60% of Japan’s annual consumption.

Inflation has made instant noodles a popular, affordable meal. Acecook’s Hao Hao brand, priced at around 18 cents per pack, dominates. Higher-priced options, with more ingredients, are also gaining traction.

Acecook plans to expand its production capacity with two new factories by 2027. The company predicts Vietnam’s consumption will hit 10 billion servings by 2030.

Global instant noodle consumption rose 13% from 2019 to 120.2 billion servings in 2023. Southeast Asia accounts for 30% of this, with Vietnam leading at 83 servings per capita.

Masan Consumer, Acecook’s rival, focuses on premium products. Its Omachi brand offers self-boiling hot pots, priced over $4. Masan aims to shift the perception of instant noodles from unhealthy to a “pleasant and delicious” meal.

Southeast Asia drives the global market. Noodle packets are lighter, encouraging more consumption. Local brands like Mama in Thailand and Lucky Me in the Philippines are strong.

Indonesia, the largest market, consumes 14.5 billion servings annually. Indofood, with its Indomie brand, leads. The rural market is expanding as instant noodles become a convenient, cheap meal.

Companies like Acecook and Indofood are accelerating overseas expansion to meet global demand. Vietnam is set to become Acecook’s export hub.
