Apollo Quiboloy, a pastor in the Philippines, claimed to be the “appointed son of God.” He led the Kingdom of Jesus Christ (KOJC) church, which boasts millions of members. In 2021, the US Department of Justice charged him with sex trafficking of girls and women aged 12 to 25. These “pastorals” were allegedly forced into sexual relations with him.

Quiboloy went into hiding after a Philippine court ordered his arrest on similar charges. The police launched a two-week manhunt, culminating in his surrender after a 24-hour ultimatum. He was flown to the capital and detained in a heavily guarded facility.

The pastor denies the allegations, blaming critics and former members for fabricating the claims. He faces additional charges of cash smuggling and visa fraud, which allegedly brought church members to the US under false pretenses.

During his flight from justice, Quiboloy demanded a guarantee against “extraordinary rendition”—a US practice of transferring detainees to other countries for interrogation.

Despite the serious allegations, some followers of KOJC have shown support, embracing police officers after Quiboloy’s arrest.

**Extraordinary Rendition**: A controversial practice where a country transfers a detainee to another nation for interrogation, often without legal oversight.
