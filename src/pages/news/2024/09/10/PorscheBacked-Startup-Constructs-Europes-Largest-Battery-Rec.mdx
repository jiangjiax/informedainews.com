Cylib, a startup backed by Porsche and Bosch, is constructing Europe's largest lithium-ion battery recycling plant in Dormagen, Germany. The facility, spanning 236,000 square feet, will recycle 30,000 metric tons of end-of-life EV batteries annuallyâ€”more than double the capacity of the current largest plant, Hydrovolt.

The project, funded with over 180 million euros, aims to support Europe's transition to electric vehicles by ensuring sustainable battery production. Cylib's water-based recovery techniques will repurpose materials like lithium and graphite, reducing environmental impact.

Porsche, an early investor, plans to use the recycled batteries in its vehicles. The plant, set to begin operations in 2026, is part of Cylib's broader strategy to establish multiple recycling facilities across Europe.

Battery recycling is crucial for the European Union's sustainable development goals. Cylib's CEO, Lilian Schwich, emphasizes that this initiative pioneers the circular economy, demonstrating that economic success and environmental responsibility can coexist.
