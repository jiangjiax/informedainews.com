Vanuatu, Fiji, and Samoa have proposed to the International Criminal Court (ICC) that ecocide—severe environmental damage—be recognized as a crime. If approved, ecocide would join genocide and war crimes as prosecutable offenses. The proposal defines ecocide as "unlawful or wanton acts" causing substantial, widespread, or long-term environmental harm.

The move faces years of debate and likely opposition, though much will be behind closed doors. Philippe Sands KC, an international lawyer, is confident ecocide will be recognized, though the timing remains uncertain. Belgium has already criminalized ecocide, and other nations are considering similar laws.

Stop Ecocide International has campaigned since 2017 for this change. Vanuatu first called for ecocide recognition in 2019. Even if approved, it could take a decade before any charges are filed. Still, the proposal is crucial for broader acceptance of ecocide as a crime.

**Insights:**
The proposal marks a significant shift in how we value and protect our environment. By elevating environmental harm to a criminal offense, it underscores the gravity of ecological destruction. The journey to recognition will be long and contentious, but the momentum is building. As nations like Belgium take steps to criminalize ecocide, the global consensus on environmental responsibility grows. This proposal is not just about legal recognition; it's about changing the moral and ethical framework within which we operate. It signals a new era where the health of our planet is no longer a secondary concern but a primary one, deserving of the same legal protections as human rights.
