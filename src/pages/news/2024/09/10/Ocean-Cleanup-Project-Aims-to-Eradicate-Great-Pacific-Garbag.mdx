The Ocean Cleanup, after six years, claims it can eradicate the Great Pacific Garbage Patch within a decade. The patch, twice Texas' size, holds 79,000 metric tons of plastic. A $7.5 billion effort would take ten years; a $4 billion push could halve that time. The group's U-shaped barriers have already removed over a million pounds of trash. Next year, they plan a hiatus to map high-plastic zones for more effective cleanup. The message: ocean cleanup is feasible, affordable, and urgent.
