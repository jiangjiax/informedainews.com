The Polaris Dawn mission, funded by billionaire Jared Isaacman, launched on September 10, 2024, from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. A Falcon 9 rocket carried four astronauts into orbit, marking the first commercial spacewalk.

Isaacman, a seasoned pilot, leads the crew, which includes a retired military fighter pilot and two SpaceX employees. The mission aims to reach an altitude of 1,400 km, testing Starlink-laser communications and conducting microgravity research.

Spacewalks, or EVAs (extravehicular activities), have historically been the domain of government agencies. Polaris Dawn's spacewalk, planned for the third day at 435 miles, will be a significant milestone. The Crew Dragon craft lacks an airlock, so the entire cabin will be depressurized, and all four astronauts will wear SpaceX-designed spacesuits.

Elon Musk's SpaceX plans to colonize Mars and has been developing Starship, the largest rocket ever built. Polaris Dawn will also study the effects of space radiation on the crew, crucial for future deep space missions.

Private companies like SpaceX are increasingly leading space exploration, as governments focus on other expenditures. NASA has contracted SpaceX to land astronauts on the moon, including the first woman, by the end of this decade.
