The Chinese Football Association (CFA) has banned 38 players and five club officials for life, following a two-year investigation into match-fixing and gambling. The probe uncovered 120 fixed matches involving 41 clubs. Notable names among the banned include former China internationals Jin Jingdao and Gu Chao, and South Korean midfielder Son Jun-ho.

Son’s agent called the accusations “ridiculous” and plans a press conference to address the matter. Despite the CFA ruling, Son’s current club, Suwon, intends to continue using him unless ordered otherwise.

The investigation led to criminal penalties for 44 individuals, including bribery, gambling, and illegal casino operations. The CFA president, Song Kai, announced life bans for 43 individuals and five-year bans for 17 others.

This crackdown reflects ongoing efforts to cleanse Chinese football of corruption, a problem long blamed for the national team’s underperformance. Recent high-profile cases include a former CFA vice-president sentenced to 11 years for bribery and a former competition department director sentenced to seven years for the same offense.
