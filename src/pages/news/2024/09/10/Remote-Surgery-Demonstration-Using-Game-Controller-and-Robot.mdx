Swiss surgeons used a PlayStation controller to perform an endoscopic surgery on a pig in Hong Kong, 9,300 kilometers away. The procedure, utilizing a robotic system and magnetic endoscope, showcased the potential for remote human surgeries in underserved areas. The system's latency of under 300 milliseconds enabled near-real-time control. This innovation could extend surgical expertise to remote regions and even space missions.
