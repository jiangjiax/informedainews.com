The Ministry of Ecology and Environment announced that key emission industries such as steel will be included in the national carbon market. This move aims to accelerate green and low-carbon development, improve the construction of the carbon market, and promote global climate governance. China plans to optimize its industrial and energy structures, promote the development of the environmental protection industry, and strengthen international cooperation. The national carbon emission trading market has been operating smoothly, with cumulative trading volume reaching 365 million tons.

**Carbon Market**: Refers to a trading system that uses market mechanisms to control and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
