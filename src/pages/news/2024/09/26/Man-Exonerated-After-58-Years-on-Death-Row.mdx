In 1966, a fire at a Japanese miso factory claimed the lives of a family of four. The sole survivor, the eldest daughter, accused factory worker Hakamada Iwao of the murder. Police arrested Hakamada, subjected him to brutal interrogations, and coerced a confession from him. Despite DNA evidence later exonerating him, Hakamada was sentenced to death in 1968.

For 48 years, Hakamada remained in prison, becoming the world's longest-serving death row inmate. His sister, Hakamada Hideko, tirelessly fought for his release. In 2014, a court finally granted him a retrial and released him.

The case revolved around a blood-stained pajama top found in Hakamada's dormitory. Initial tests revealed that the blood type did not match his. Despite this, police continued to press the case, fabricating evidence and manipulating the trial.

A retired judge, Kumamoto Norimichi, who had originally voted for Hakamada's conviction, later expressed doubts. He believed the confession was coerced and the evidence was fabricated.

In 2023, after decades of struggle, Hakamada was finally exonerated. The court acknowledged the flaws in the original trial and the misconduct of the police.

This case highlights the dangers of coerced confessions and the importance of thorough, unbiased investigations. It serves as a stark reminder of the fragility of justice and the need for constant vigilance.
