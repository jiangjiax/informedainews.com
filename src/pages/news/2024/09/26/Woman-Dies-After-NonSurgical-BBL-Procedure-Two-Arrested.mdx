Alice Webb, a 33-year-old mother of five, died following a non-surgical Brazilian butt lift (BBL) procedure. Two individuals have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter. Webb fell ill and passed away at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital. This marks the first known death from a BBL in the UK.

BBL involves injecting fat or dermal filler into the buttocks to alter size or shape. While not illegal, the procedure carries risks such as blood clots, sepsis, and tissue death. Several UK local authorities have banned certain companies from performing liquid BBLs due to these dangers.

Webb's partner, Dane Knight, urged the public to consider her daughters' feelings before speculating about her death. Gloucestershire Police's major crime team is investigating.

Save Face, a register of accredited non-surgical cosmetic practitioners, has supported 500 women with complications from BBL. Director Ashton Collins described liquid BBLs as "a crisis waiting to happen," criticizing their promotion as risk-free and cheaper alternatives to surgical BBLs.
