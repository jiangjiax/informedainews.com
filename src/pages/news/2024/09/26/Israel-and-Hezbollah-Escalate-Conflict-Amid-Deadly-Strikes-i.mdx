Israel and Hezbollah exchanged heavy blows. Israel targeted Hezbollah positions in Lebanon, while Hezbollah struck military facilities in Israel. Lebanon experienced its deadliest day in decades, with 558 people killed, including 50 children and 94 women.

Israel's military chief, Herzi Halevi, pledged to intensify attacks on Hezbollah. Overnight, Israel launched strikes on dozens of Hezbollah targets, including missile launchers and weapon storage facilities. Hezbollah responded by hitting an explosives factory in Israel with Fadi rockets.

Beirut was again hit, with an Israeli airstrike targeting a Hezbollah commander. The strike damaged a building in the Ghobeiry neighborhood. Hezbollah also attacked the Megiddo airfield near Afula.

Lebanon's hospitals are overwhelmed, and Haifa's main hospital has moved operations underground. The UN anticipates tens of thousands of displaced people in Lebanon.

The US is deploying more troops to the region, raising concerns of a broader conflict involving Iran and its proxies. The G7 expressed concern about the risk of a wider war.

Israel's intelligence and technological superiority has given it a strong advantage, enabling it to track and assassinate top Hezbollah and Hamas leaders.

The escalating conflict threatens to destabilize the Middle East, exacerbating the ongoing war in Gaza.
