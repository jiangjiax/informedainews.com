Lady Gaga is set to release "Harlequin," her seventh studio album, as a companion to the upcoming film "Joker: Folie à Deux." The album, announced on September 24, is expected to be the highlight of the movie, which has received mixed reviews.

The album features a mix of covers and original tracks, including songs like "Good Morning," "World On A String," and "That’s Life." These selections suggest a nod to classic Hollywood and jazz, aligning with Gaga's previous work and the musical nature of the film.

Gaga's cryptic social media teasers leading up to the announcement sparked excitement among her fans, known as Little Monsters. The album art, depicting Gaga in a shower with running makeup and a life vest, adds a compelling visual element.

In typical Hemingway fashion, I’d say this album is likely to be the standout element of the film. Gaga’s talent for blending old-school charm with modern flair ensures "Harlequin" will be a memorable addition to her discography.
