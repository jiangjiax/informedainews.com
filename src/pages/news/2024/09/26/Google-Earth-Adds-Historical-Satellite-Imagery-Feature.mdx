Google Earth will soon allow users to view satellite images from up to 80 years ago.

Selected cities such as London, Berlin, Warsaw, and Paris will have imagery dating back to the 1930s.

Users can compare historical and current photos, such as witnessing San Franciscoâ€™s port transform from shipping to restaurants and cruise ships.

The feature will be available on both web and mobile platforms.

Google also plans to expand Street View in nearly 80 countries and enhance image quality using AI.
