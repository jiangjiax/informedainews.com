Thailand has legalized same-sex marriage, becoming the first country in Southeast Asia to do so. The law, endorsed by King Maha Vajiralongkorn, grants LGBTQ couples equal rights, including tax benefits, inheritance, and adoption. Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra celebrated the milestone, emphasizing "Love Wins." A support group urges couples to register immediately. Despite a reputation for tolerance, Thailand's laws previously fell short. The ruling party prioritized this reform.
