The Tokyo Game Show, a four-day expo, kicked off on September 26 with a record 985 exhibitors and 3,252 booths. The event, themed "Trailblaze the World with Gaming," saw over half of its exhibitors from abroad, signaling global interest in the Japanese gaming industry. Organizers expect 250,000 visitors.

Nintendo, notably absent, has fans eagerly awaiting news of a successor to the Nintendo Switch. Sony Interactive Entertainment, however, returns after a five-year hiatus, announcing the PlayStation 5 Pro for November. Ken Kutaragi, the "father of the PlayStation," spoke on the 30th anniversary, predicting AI-driven real-time computing as the next big thing in entertainment.

The show, both physical and virtual, will be streamed globally, with influencers from 12 countries sharing their experiences. Toge Productions, an Indonesian indie studio, showcased its new game set in 1970s Southeast Asia. Hong Kong-based Daytech HK, debuting with a cat-themed shooting game, highlighted the shift towards mobile gaming.

The Tokyo Game Show reflects a growing global fascination with gaming, blending innovation and accessibility.
