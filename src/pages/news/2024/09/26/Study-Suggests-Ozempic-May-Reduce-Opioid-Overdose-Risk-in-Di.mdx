Novo Nordisk's diabetes drug Ozempic, which contains semaglutide, may reduce the risk of opioid overdose in patients with Type 2 diabetes and opioid use disorder, according to a study published in JAMA Network Open. The study, which was not funded by Novo Nordisk, analyzed nearly 33,000 patient records from 2017 to 2023. Users of semaglutide showed a 58% lower risk of overdose compared to those taking other diabetes medications.

The study suggests that Ozempic could be a tool in combating the U.S. opioid crisis, which was declared a public health emergency in 2017. Currently, only about 25% of patients with opioid use disorder receive recommended treatments, with many discontinuing treatment within six months. Opioids are responsible for 72% of overdose deaths in the U.S.

GLP-1 drugs, such as Ozempic, are increasingly being studied for benefits beyond diabetes and obesity, including in chronic conditions and addictive behaviors. More clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings and determine the drug's efficacy in broader populations of opioid use disorder patients.

**Key Terms:**
- **GLP-1s:** A class of drugs that enhance insulin secretion and reduce glucagon release, used for diabetes and obesity.
- **Opioid Use Disorder:** A chronic condition characterized by problematic use of opioids, leading to significant impairment or distress.
