Donald Trump, Republican presidential candidate, narrowly escaped an assassination attempt while golfing in West Palm Beach, Florida. Secret Service agents intercepted a gunman armed with an AK-47-style rifle, approximately 400 yards from Trump. The suspect, Ryan Wesley Routh, fled but was later arrested.

This incident follows a previous shooting at a Trump rally in Pennsylvania, where Trump sustained a minor ear injury. Both events underscore the heightened security challenges for presidential candidates amid a polarized election.

Routh, identified by CNN, Fox News, and The New York Times, had profiles on X, Facebook, and LinkedIn suggesting he was a supporter of Ukraine in its conflict with Russia. His social media activity also indicated support for Democratic candidates Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden.

Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw praised the Secret Service's response, noting they acted swiftly to protect Trump. The suspect's motive remains unclear.

Trump, currently in a tight race with Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, expressed gratitude for his Secret Service detail. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were briefed on the incident and expressed relief at Trump's safety.
