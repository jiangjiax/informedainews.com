The ozone layer hole was once a global focal point, and although it is now rarely mentioned, the issue has not disappeared. The ozone layer remains damaged, but the trend is improving. The key lies in the control of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), a successful case of global environmental activism.

The ozone layer absorbs ultraviolet rays, protecting life on Earth. In the 1970s, scientists discovered that CFCs could destroy ozone. In 1985, the Antarctic ozone hole was discovered, prompting the signing of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which restricted CFC use.

The protocol has been highly effective, with the ozone layer expected to recover in most regions by 2040, and in Antarctica by 2066. However, a full recovery to pre-industrial levels could take a century.

The success of the protocol can be attributed to the urgency of the issue, scientific and political cooperation, and the outdated nature of CFC technology. A key factor was the shift in the U.S. stance, with President Reagan, due to personal health concerns, actively pushing for the protocol.

Despite this, the recovery process has had its setbacks. In 2013, an unexpected increase in CFC-11 emissions was detected, and the 2022 eruption of the Tongan volcano also affected the ozone layer. The alternative to CFCs, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), while not ozone-depleting, are still potent greenhouse gases.

In the future, continued efforts to reduce HFC use will be necessary to ensure the ozone layer's true recovery.
