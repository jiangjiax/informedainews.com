Britain's Defense Ministry reports that Iran has supplied Russia with close-range ballistic missiles. These missiles, with a 120-kilometer range and 30-meter accuracy, enhance Russia's precision strikes on Ukraine. Sanctions are being imposed on entities linked to both Iran and Russia. Meanwhile, Russia is producing long-range drones using Chinese engines, which has raised concerns among Western nations. NATO is urging China to cease supporting Russia's war efforts.
