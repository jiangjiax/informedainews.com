Tom Hiddleston's "The Life of Chuck," an adaptation of Stephen King's novella, won the Toronto film festival audience award. The film, directed by Mike Flanagan, surprised with its genre-bending take on an accountant's life. Critics praised its balance of sweetness and scariness. King congratulated the "dark horse" winner. Past winners of this award often receive Oscar nominations. The first runner-up was the crime musical comedy "Emilia PÃ©rez," and the second was the Palme d'Or-winning "Anora."
