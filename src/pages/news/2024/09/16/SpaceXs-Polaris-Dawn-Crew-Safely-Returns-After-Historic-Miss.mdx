SpaceX's Polaris Dawn crew returned safely to Earth after a historic mission. They splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico, off the coast of Dry Tortugas, Florida. The mission reached a higher altitude than any human has in five decades—870 miles. It also featured the first commercial spacewalk, funded and operated privately.

The return journey was perilous. The Crew Dragon capsule endured extreme heat—up to 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit—during re-entry. A heat shield protected the crew. The capsule slowed using parachutes and was retrieved by rescue teams.

During the mission, the crew conducted 40 science experiments. Astronaut Jessica Gillis, a violinist, played "Rey's Theme" from "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" in space, connecting with orchestras on Earth.

SpaceX COO Gwynne Shotwell expressed deep emotion, calling the mission "extraordinary" and the performance "tear-inducing." The crew's safe return marked a significant milestone in commercial space exploration.
