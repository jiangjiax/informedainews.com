Huada Group has launched two nanopore sequencers: WT02 (Wu Tong) and WY01 (Wu Yue). These devices fill the gap in China's high-throughput nanopore sequencing field.

The CycloneSEQ sequencer boasts four key features: long, fast, small, and accurate. It can identify over a hundred pathogens and complete single-bacterial assemblies for thousands of species.

WT02 is a medium-throughput sequencer that supports independent operation and flexible throughput selection. WY01 is a high-throughput sequencer with global leading performance, suitable for large genomes and complex disease research.

Huada Group has also established the "SEQ ALL Alliance" to promote industry standard setting. Simultaneously, it has launched the "Polar Exploration Plan" to explore life sciences research in extreme environments.

Huada Group has deployed over 200 patents in the nanopore sequencing field, making it the world's only company with both long-read and short-read sequencing tools.

Nanopore sequencer: A device that reads DNA sequences through nanoscale pores, capable of rapidly and accurately analyzing genomes.
