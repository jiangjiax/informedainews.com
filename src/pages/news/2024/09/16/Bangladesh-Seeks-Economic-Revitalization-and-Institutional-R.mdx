Bangladesh, under caretaker leader Muhammad Yunus, seeks a "reset, reform, restart" after ousting Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Yunus met with a U.S. delegation led by Donald Lu, discussing economic revitalization and institutional reforms.

The new government aims to recover $100 billion embezzled over 15 years, primarily through trade mis-invoicing and the hundi network. The U.S. pledged $202 million in aid, adding to the $425 million already disbursed under a 2021 agreement.

International support includes $2.5 billion from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank for banking reforms. Bangladesh also seeks an additional $5 billion from the IMF.

The U.S. delegation's visit signals significant support, crucial for Bangladesh's economic stability. American companies, key in Bangladesh's clothing export sector, could boost growth with appropriate reforms.

Washington's backing aligns with public demands for effective governance and sustainable democratic institutions, reflecting ongoing U.S. engagement in the Indo-Pacific region.
