The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has directly connected with the Monetary Authority of Macao (AMCM), linking the CMU with the Central Securities Depository System of Macao. This move allows investors from Hong Kong and Macao to directly settle, clear, and hold bonds in each other's systems, marking a new milestone in financial cooperation between Hong Kong and Macao, and holding significant implications for the coordinated development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.

CMU: Central Moneymarkets Unit of Hong Kong

Central Securities Depository System of Macao: The securities custody and settlement system under the AMCM
