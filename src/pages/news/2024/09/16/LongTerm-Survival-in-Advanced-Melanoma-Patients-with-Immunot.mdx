More than half of advanced melanoma patients now survive at least 10 years with a combination of two immunotherapy drugs, ipilimumab and nivolumab. This treatment has drastically improved survival rates, transforming a once-fatal diagnosis into a manageable condition.

Fifteen years ago, only 5% of patients with advanced melanoma lived five years. Many died within months. Today, some patients live long enough to die from unrelated causes.

These drugs, known as immune checkpoint inhibitors, disable the immune system's "brakes," allowing it to attack cancer cells. The treatment is highly effective, with 52% of patients surviving melanoma-specific deaths after 10 years.

The trial involved 945 patients with stage 3 or 4 melanoma. It provided crucial data on treatment duration, survival rates, and side effects. Early side effects were manageable, and patients who stopped treatment early still benefited.

Lucy Davis, a trial participant, went from a terminal diagnosis to seeing her children grow up. Her story highlights the treatment's life-changing impact.

While the results are remarkable, not all patients respond. Researchers are working to understand why, focusing on tumor biology and immune system differences.

This study underscores the importance of ongoing cancer research, aiming to extend and improve lives.
