OpenAI has unveiled o1, the first in a series of "reasoning" models, previously known as the "Strawberry" project. o1 excels in complex tasks, processing queries faster than humans and demonstrating unprecedented reasoning abilities. A smaller, more affordable version, o1-mini, is also available.

o1's training differs fundamentally from previous models. It employs a new optimization algorithm and a specialized dataset, using reinforcement learning to solve problems. This approach enhances accuracy and reduces "hallucinations," though the issue persists.

Key strengths include superior performance in coding, math, and multi-step problem-solving. o1 outperforms GPT-4o in 54 out of 57 MMLU subcategories and achieves near-human levels in math and programming competitions.

However, o1 has limitations. It lacks web browsing and file/image processing capabilities and falls short in factual knowledge tasks compared to GPT-4o. The model's interface mimics human thought processes, using phrases like "I'm thinking," though it doesn't truly "think."

OpenAI emphasizes o1's potential in scientific, coding, and mathematical applications but acknowledges safety concerns. The model integrates safety strategies into its reasoning process, aiming to align with human values.
