Olympic champion Quan Hongchan returned home to visit her family, only to be met with excessive public attention, sparking social concern. Crowds gathered at her doorstep, with even drones conducting aerial photography and travel agencies offering "one-day tour" packages. Such behavior not only disrupted Quan Hongchan and her family's normal life but also exposed the shortsightedness of some individuals who prioritize traffic over boundaries.

Quan Hongchan's plea—"Please go back, it's too noisy. We need to rest"—was a direct response to this excessive attention. True concern should be demonstrated through support for athletes' training and competitions, not through endless disturbances.

Regulatory authorities have begun to crack down on such "bottom-line-crossing traffic-seeking" behaviors, emphasizing the importance of laws and regulations. Online platforms should also take measures to prevent unauthorized traffic-hijacking and ensure athletes' privacy and tranquility.

Not disturbing is the best form of respect for athletes. Society as a whole should work together to ensure that athletes like Quan Hongchan receive the applause and cheers they deserve on the field, rather than unnecessary disruptions in their daily lives.
