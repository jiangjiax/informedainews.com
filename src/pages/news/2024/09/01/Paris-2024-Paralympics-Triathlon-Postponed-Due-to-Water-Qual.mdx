Paris 2024 Paralympics: Triathlon Postponed

Heavy rain in Paris has forced a 24-hour delay for the para-triathlon events. Originally scheduled for Sunday, 1 September, the races will now occur on Monday, 2 September, pending water quality tests in the River Seine.

World Triathlon cited poor water quality due to recent rainfall. The decision to postpone was made after midnight tests revealed unsafe swimming conditions. All 11 races, including those featuring British medal hopefuls like Lauren Steadman and Dave Ellis, will proceed if the water meets safety standards.

This delay follows similar issues during the Olympic triathlon, highlighting ongoing challenges for Paris 2024 organizers. The priority remains the health and safety of the athletes.
