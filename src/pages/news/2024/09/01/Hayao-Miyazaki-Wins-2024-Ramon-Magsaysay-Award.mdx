Hayao Miyazaki, 83, co-founder of Studio Ghibli, wins the 2024 Ramon Magsaysay Award. Known for "The Boy and the Heron" and "Spirited Away," his films simplify complex issues for children. The award, Asia's equivalent to the Nobel Prize, honors his artistry and educational impact.

The Ramon Magsaysay Award, established in 1958, recognizes individuals and organizations for public service and pragmatic idealism. This year, four others join Miyazaki as recipients, each addressing pressing global issues through dedicated work.
