North Korea deploys IT workers under false identities to infiltrate Western firms, primarily in the U.S. These operatives secure remote jobs, often through freelance contracts, to gain access for cyber espionage and financial gain. The U.S. Treasury warned in 2022 about this tactic, highlighting the use of fake personas and third-party intermediaries to obscure their origins.

In a recent case, an Arizona woman, Christina Chapman, allegedly facilitated this scheme by hosting North Korean IT workers' computers in her home, making it appear as if they were U.S.-based. She handled payroll and laundered payments, involving over 300 companies and $6.8 million. Another participant, a Ukrainian national, Oleksandr Didenko, created fake accounts for these workers on U.S. job platforms.

Security firms like KnowBe4 and Palo Alto have reported being targeted by these North Korean operatives, who use advanced tools like AI-created deepfakes to enhance their deception. The threat extends globally, with North Korean IT workers actively seeking employment in various countries.

Countermeasures suggested include live video interviews and verifying home addresses to detect and deter these infiltrators.
