Macao casinos are booming again, nearing pre-pandemic highs. Six major operators saw a 36% jump in revenue, totaling HK$111.71 billion. Melco, SJM, and Galaxy led the charge, despite lingering losses from debt.

Yet, the good times may be short-lived. Authorities are cracking down on unlicensed money changers, key to the casino cash flow. These changers help mainland Chinese gamblers bypass strict capital controls. A recent police raid netted 47 suspects, with proposed five-year prison terms for unlicensed operations.

The crackdown reflects Beijing's fears of capital outflows amidst economic uncertainty. Ben Lee, of Macao-based IGamiX, suggests this might just be the start of a cat-and-mouse game between regulators and the casino industry.

The clampdown has already hit casino stocks, despite strong earnings. Shares of the six operators fell between 10% and 21% since June. The future of Macao's casino boom hangs in the balance, as authorities and the industry play a high-stakes game of regulation and evasion.
