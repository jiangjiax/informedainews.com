Amazon recruited the founders of Covariant and a quarter of its team. They also secured a license for Covariant's AI technology designed for robots. Covariant specializes in enhancing the intelligence of robots, beginning with tasks in warehouses.

Quinlivan, Amazon's Vice President, views this as a means to enhance the capabilities of their robotic systems. This strategy mirrors their previous recruitment of Adept's founders, a move referred to as a "reverse acquihire."

Covariant will continue to operate, now under the leadership of Stinson as CEO, with plans to extend their AI solutions across multiple industries.

**Explanation:**
- **Reverse acquihire:** A hiring approach where a large company absorbs a startup's team and technology, often to avoid the complexities of a full acquisition.
