Yiwu, known as China's capital of small commodities, is emerging as a crucial hub for Sino-African trade. This city boasts a collection of 2.1 million different items, ranging from needles and thread to engineering machinery, all available here. Yiwu's exports to Africa account for one-twelfth of the national total and continue to grow. Africa is undergoing rapid urbanization and industrialization, creating a significant demand for Chinese engineering machinery and agricultural equipment.

African merchants like Ding En and Sula have found fertile ground for their businesses in Yiwu. They have evolved from buyers to entrepreneurs, selling Chinese goods to Africa while also introducing African products to China. Yiwu's innovative digital platform, "Yiwu Small Commodities City China goods," assists merchants in expanding their overseas operations, utilizing AI technology to translate into multiple languages, thereby promoting trade growth.

Yiwu not only exports goods but also imports. African products such as raffia hats and nautilus fossils are well-received in Yiwu. Yiwu's investments in Africa span various sectors, including textiles and business services. Sino-African trade has transitioned from a one-way export to a mutually beneficial partnership.

Yiwu is leveraging the Belt and Road Initiative to promote the construction of trade, logistics, and settlement systems with Africa, contributing to the building of a high-level Sino-African community with a shared future.
