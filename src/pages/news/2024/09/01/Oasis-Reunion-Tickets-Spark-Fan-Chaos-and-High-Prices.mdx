Oasis reunion tickets caused pandemonium. Fans grappled with technical issues, lengthy queues, and allegations of bots. Some managed to secure tickets, while others encountered system crashes and heartbreak.

Scalpers dramatically increased prices. Official tickets varied from £73 to £506.25. Resale prices skyrocketed to £4,500. Dynamic pricing on Ticketmaster doubled certain ticket costs.

UK Music CEO, Tom Kiehl, cautioned against exorbitant prices. The concerts will take place in July and August across major cities in the UK and Ireland.

Oasis disbanded 16 years ago. This tour commemorates 30 years since "Morning Glory." Fans are fervent, and prices are steep. The Gallagher brothers have returned.
