Tem, a U.K. startup, aims to revolutionize the energy sector by cutting out middlemen and connecting businesses directly to renewable energy sources. Founded in 2021, Tem has raised £10.5 million in a Series A round led by Atomico, signaling growing interest in sustainable energy solutions.

**Key Points:**
- **Neo-Utility Concept:** Tem positions itself as the U.K.'s first "neo-utility," leveraging technology to streamline energy procurement.
- **AI Matching Algorithm:** The platform uses AI to match businesses with renewable energy generators, offering transparent pricing and billing.
- **Cost Savings:** Tem claims energy prices are 10-25% cheaper than the wholesale market, benefiting smaller businesses.
- **Marketplace:** Tem operates a marketplace with over 50 renewable generators, including solar, wind, and biogas plants.

By focusing on technology and partnerships, Tem avoids the pitfalls of traditional utility models, offering a more stable and cost-effective solution. As global efforts to reduce carbon emissions intensify, Tem's innovative platform could play a pivotal role in accelerating the transition to renewable energy.
