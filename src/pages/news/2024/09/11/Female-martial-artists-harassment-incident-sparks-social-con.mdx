Female martial artist Ms. Xu was sexually harassed and did not fight back, leading to online backlash. Ms. Xu, a judo practitioner who has represented the national team and is now a mixed martial arts fighter, was followed and harassed by an unknown man one night. She chose to lead him to a well-lit area and call the police instead of retaliating.

Netizens questioned: "Why not fight back?" Ms. Xu explained that as a professional athlete, her strikes could be too forceful, fearing severe consequences. Self-defense is a right, not an obligation. Ms. Xu's calm decision protected herself and punished the lawbreaker.

**Self-Defense**: The law grants citizens the right to defend themselves against serious violent crimes, but exercising it is a personal choice. Ms. Xu's decision was based on rational thinking, avoiding excessive harm.

**Online Backlash**: The public should not condemn victims who do not exercise their rights. Stepping forward is bravery, but forcing others to do so is not justice. Not exercising a right is not a mistake; failing to protect that right is a dereliction of duty.
