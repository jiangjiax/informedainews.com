SATS, a Singapore-based airport services provider, aims to double its overseas food sales by 2029, focusing on India and China. The company, which operates in 33 locations across 10 countries, provides in-flight catering to over 60 airlines and is expanding its ground-based food services.

Stanley Goh, head of SATS' food solutions, emphasizes the need for growth beyond Singapore, noting high demand for ready-to-eat meals in urbanizing China and India. SATS recently opened its largest kitchen in Bengaluru, India, to meet this demand.

To tackle supply chain challenges, SATS partnered with Japanese trading house Mitsui & Co. in July. Mitsui acquired a 15% stake in SATS' subsidiaries in India, Thailand, China, and Singapore for about $27 million. Mitsui's global network aims to resolve supply chain issues and facilitate expansion.

SATS is also diversifying its food business beyond aviation. Its subsidiary, TFK, launched Nâ€™s Deli, a frozen-food brand featuring Asian cuisine, available online in Japan. SATS plans to supply frozen meals to Muji by early 2025, leveraging Mitsui's customer network.

Kerry Mok, SATS' CEO, acknowledges the impact of COVID-19 and trade wars on the aviation industry. Despite challenges, SATS remains committed to expanding its food business, aiming for resilience and growth in new markets.
