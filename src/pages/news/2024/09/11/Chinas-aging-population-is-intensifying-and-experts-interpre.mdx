China is facing the challenge of an increasingly aging population. In 2021, the proportion of the population aged 65 and above reached 14.2%, marking the stage of moderate aging. By 2035, it is projected that the number of people aged 60 and above will exceed 400 million, accounting for over 30% of the population, entering a stage of severe aging.

To address this trend, China plans to implement a gradual delay of the statutory retirement age. This move aims to release the potential of labor resources and boost productivity. Experts point out that with increased life expectancy and health levels, as well as changes in labor methods, extending working years becomes feasible.

Zhao Zhong, Dean of the School of Labor and Human Resources at Renmin University of China, stated that the increase in life expectancy means the age at which one can continue to engage in production and business activities also increases. Through institutional reforms, the country's labor force size can be expanded, which is of great significance for socio-economic development.

**Key Term Explanations:**
- **Gradual Delay of Statutory Retirement Age**: The phased and step-by-step postponement of the legal retirement age.
- **Total Factor Productivity**: A comprehensive indicator measuring production efficiency, involving labor, capital, technology, and other factors.

This reform is not only a response to demographic changes but also a strategic layout for the sustainable development of society and the economy in the future.
