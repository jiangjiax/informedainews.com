Los Angeles prepares to host the 2028 Olympics, following Paris' successful 2024 Games. Mayor Karen Bass is anxious about the city's readiness, focusing on public transportation and homelessness. She aims for "no cars to the venues," requiring significant investment in bus and subway infrastructure. The city plans to build over 18,000 units for the unhoused.

Bass also discusses shifting work schedules and truck deliveries to reduce traffic. LA 2028 President Casey Wasserman sees Paris as a model, emphasizing the need to showcase LA's unique culture. No new permanent venues will be built, a first for the Olympics.

The Hollywood Sign's potential alteration for the Games, though complex, offers a spectacular opportunity. Actress Jessica Alba, on the LA 2028 board, highlights the city's diverse culture, from Hollywood to fashion and food.

LA aims to be a "main character" during the Olympics, leveraging its landmarks and cultural richness.
