Nippon Shokubai, a Japanese chemical group, plans to build a $263 million plant to produce lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI), an electrolyte that extends electric vehicle (EV) battery life by 60%. The plant, set to start production in 2028, will be located in Fukuoka prefecture, Japan, near Toyota’s new EV battery factory.

LiFSI, more effective than the commonly used lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6), can boost battery charging cycles from 500 to 800. However, its purification process is complex, raising costs. Nippon Shokubai currently sells LiFSI as an additive to LiPF6 in China, where it costs 20%-30% more.

By 2028, Nippon Shokubai aims to increase its domestic electrolyte production capacity to 3,000 tonnes yearly, enough for 210,000 EVs. The company leads in LiFSI mass production patents and maintains superior purity over Chinese competitors.

Japan is strengthening its EV supply chain, with the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry offering up to $88 million in subsidies for Nippon Shokubai’s new plant. This initiative aligns with the growing EV materials industry in southwestern Japan, including semiconductor production by companies like TSMC and Sony.
