Antarctic sea ice is on the brink of a second consecutive winter record low. In 2023, the ice cover shrank by 1.6 million square kilometers—an area larger than Britain, France, Germany, and Spain combined. This year, the trend continues, with ice extent already below last year’s levels.

Dr. Will Hobbs, a sea ice researcher, calls these events “incredible extreme.” He notes that warmer Southern Ocean temperatures, driven by global warming, are the main culprit. Global temperatures have been more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels for extended periods.

On September 7, Southern Ocean sea ice covered 17 million square kilometers, less than the previous low of 17.1 million square kilometers in 2023. The long-term average for that date is 18.4 million square kilometers.

While sea ice loss doesn’t directly raise sea levels, it has indirect impacts. It removes a protective barrier, accelerating glacial ice loss and ocean warming. Exposed dark waters absorb more heat, further destabilizing the Antarctic environment.

Scientists warn that recovery could take decades, and the long-term effects of global heating are becoming clear. The Antarctic system may have shifted to a “new state,” with lasting consequences for global weather patterns and ocean health.
