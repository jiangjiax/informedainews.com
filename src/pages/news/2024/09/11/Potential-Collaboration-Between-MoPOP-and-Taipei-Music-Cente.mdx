Jimi Hendrix's Woodstock Fender Strat, a legendary guitar, is the crown jewel of MoPOP, the Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle. Valued at millions, it's a relic of Hendrix's iconic performance at Woodstock, where he reimagined the U.S. national anthem as a psychedelic rock anthem. This guitar, unlike many other priceless instruments, is maintained in playable condition, symbolizing the enduring power of music.

MoPOP, founded by Paul Allen, houses over 80,000 artifacts, including 6,000 related to Hendrix. The museum's eclectic collection spans music, film, fashion, and gaming, reflecting the diverse facets of pop culture.

Recently, MoPOP's director, Michele Y. Smith, hinted at the possibility of bringing Hendrix's artifacts, including the Woodstock guitar, to Taiwan. She suggested that the guitar could be played by a suitable Taiwanese musician, echoing the tradition of lending Stradivarius violins to renowned performers.

This proposal raises an intriguing question: Who in Taiwan could honor Hendrix's legacy with such a prestigious instrument? The author dreams of seeing Wu Bai, a renowned Taiwanese rocker, wielding this iconic guitar.

The potential collaboration between MoPOP and the Taipei Music Center could bridge cultural gaps, celebrating the universal language of music. It's a testament to the enduring influence of Hendrix and the ongoing relevance of his revolutionary sound.
