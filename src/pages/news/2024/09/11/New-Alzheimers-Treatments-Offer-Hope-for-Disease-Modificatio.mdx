The FDA recently approved two drugs, Kisunla and Leqembi, designed to remove amyloid protein clumps in Alzheimer's patients. These drugs mark a shift from symptom management to targeting disease processes.

Lennart Mucke, MD, of Gladstone Institutes, played a key role in developing these treatments. He emphasizes that while promising, these drugs are costly, require IV infusions, and need close monitoring. Efforts are underway to improve their safety and accessibility.

Alzheimer's is complex, necessitating diverse treatment approaches. Over 160 clinical trials are currently exploring various disease-modifying strategies. Gladstone scientists are also studying APOE4 and tau proteins, and have discovered a potential treatment for neurodegeneration triggered by blood protein fibrin.

Nonprofit research institutes like Gladstone are crucial, as pharmaceutical companies have largely withdrawn from brain disorder drug development due to high failure rates. Gladstone's mission is to pioneer high-risk areas and identify novel treatment angles.

New technologies, including AI and gene editing, are reshaping Alzheimer's research. These tools provide deeper insights into disease mechanisms and potential treatments.

Mucke envisions a future where neurodegenerative diseases are fully treatable and preventable within 25 years.
