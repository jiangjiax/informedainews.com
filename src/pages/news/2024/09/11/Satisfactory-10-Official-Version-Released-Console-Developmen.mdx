Coffee Stain has released the 1.0 version of "Satisfactory," a factory-building simulation game, priced at 136 RMB on Steam in China. For two weeks post-launch, a 10% discount is available. Over five years of early access, the game sold more than 6 million copies. The 1.0 update introduces a reworked storyline, new mysteries, and advanced alien technology, categorized as the 9th tier.

Players, both new and returning, will explore the alien planet "Epsilon-2(A-B)b" as FICSIT Corporation pioneers. Their mission is to advance the "Assembly Project" by mining resources, crafting components, and sending them via a space elevator to complete the enigmatic "Savior Project."

Key features include:
- **Teleporters:** Instant travel across vast alien terrains, powered by a robust electrical grid and singularity batteries.
- **Dimensional Storage Stations:** Cloud-like resource management, accessible from anywhere, reducing travel time.
- **Advanced Technology:** Utilize alien artifacts and exotic matter (SAM) to unlock FICSIT's most potent tech.

Visuals and customization have also been enhanced:
- **New Decorations:** Including windows, fences, and polished finishes like chrome, red copper, and carbon steel.
- **Customizable Uniforms:** Players can now personalize colors, helmets, and tool accessories.

"Satisfactory" 1.0 is now available on Steam and Epic Games platforms.
