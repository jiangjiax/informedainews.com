Spotter, a startup underwriting creators and leveraging AI tools, secured $7.4 million in funding. This follows a $200 million Series D round led by SoftBank in 2022, valuing Spotter at $1.7 billion. The company invests in YouTube creators like MrBeast and The Try Guys, providing upfront capital in exchange for licensing rights to their content. Spotter recoups its investment through ad revenue.

Spotter has invested $940 million across 735 YouTube channels. This model is popular among creator startups like Jellysmack and Creative Juice. Creators often struggle to secure traditional funding despite profitable businesses. Startups like Karat offer financial resources, and VCs invest directly in creators.

Spotter's model offers creators substantial capital with few alternatives. MrBeast, for example, used Spotter's funding to launch a Spanish-language channel, boosting his viewership by over 300%. Spotter CEO Aaron DeBevoise notes that creators often return for additional deals, seeing the benefits of reinvestment.

The recent funding coincides with the launch of Spotter Studio, an AI-powered suite of tools for creators. Spotter declined to specify how the new funds will be used.

**Insights:**
Spotter's model bridges the gap between creators and traditional finance. By providing upfront capital and AI tools, it empowers creators to grow their channels. The recurring deals indicate a mutually beneficial relationship. However, the reliance on ad revenue and licensing rights raises questions about long-term sustainability and creator autonomy.
