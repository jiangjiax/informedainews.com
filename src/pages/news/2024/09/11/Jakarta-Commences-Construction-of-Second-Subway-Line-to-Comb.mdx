Jakarta, Indonesia’s sprawling capital, broke ground on its second subway line, the East-West MRT, on September 11, 2024. President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, aims to alleviate the city’s crippling traffic congestion and foster suburban development. The new line, stretching 84 kilometers, will connect Cikarang in West Java to Balaraja in Banten.

Phase 1, covering 24.5 kilometers, begins in 2025 and is slated for completion by 2031. Japan, a key partner, has pledged a $982 million loan and will supply technology for the rolling stock and signal systems. Ambassador Yasushi Masaki views the MRT as a symbol of economic partnership between Indonesia and Japan.

Jakarta, home to over 10 million, suffers from inadequate public transport. Motorbikes dominate, exacerbating air pollution. The World Bank estimates traffic congestion costs Indonesia $5.6 billion annually, equivalent to 0.5% of GDP. Jokowi has prioritized public transport infrastructure since taking office in 2014.

Beyond the East-West Line, Indonesia is extending the existing North-South Line with Japan’s aid. A 5.8-kilometer extension is due in 2030. Additionally, Indonesia launched Southeast Asia’s first bullet train, connecting Jakarta and Bandung, with Chinese support.

The new MRT line is a bold step toward modernizing Jakarta’s transport system, aiming to make the city more livable and globally competitive.
