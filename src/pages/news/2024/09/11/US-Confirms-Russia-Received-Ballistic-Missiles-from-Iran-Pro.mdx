US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that Russia has received new ballistic missiles from Iran, likely to be used in Ukraine. This marks the first US confirmation of such a transfer. The missiles, Fateh-360, have a range of 19 to 75 miles and can travel at Mach 3.

The news prompted new sanctions on Iran from the US and Europe, complicating any potential rapprochement with the West. It also raised questions about US restrictions on Ukraine using British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles to strike deep within Russia.

Blinken highlighted concerns over Ukraine's ability to maintain and strategically use these missiles. The debate centers on whether allowing such strikes would dangerously escalate the conflict.

Ukraine, with UK backing, seeks permission to strike deeper into Russia. US President Joe Biden has allowed limited cross-border strikes for self-defense.

The issue is expected to be discussed further when UK leader Keir Starmer meets Biden in Washington. Germany, under pressure, called for a peace conference, but Blinken's revelation may shift the debate.

Germany, France, and the UK condemned Iran's decision, announcing sanctions including banning Iran's civilian airline from Europe.

Iran denied providing the missiles, calling such actions inhumane. CIA Director William Burns said the missiles, if used, would be identifiable.

The UK and US aim to hear directly from Ukrainian leadership about their needs and strategic objectives. The situation remains tense, with ongoing concerns about escalation and European security.
