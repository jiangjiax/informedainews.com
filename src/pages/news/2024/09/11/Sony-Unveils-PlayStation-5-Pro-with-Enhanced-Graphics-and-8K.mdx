Sony has unveiled the PlayStation 5 Pro, priced at £699, launching on November 7. This digital-only console boasts a 2TB SSD, a GPU with 67% more compute units, and 28% more system memory, promising a 45% graphics boost. It supports 8K gaming and advanced ray tracing.

The Pro will feature "PS5 Pro Enhanced" labels for compatible games, including first-party titles like *Horizon Forbidden West* and third-party games like *Assassin’s Creed: Shadows*. AI-driven upscaling will enhance older games, and the PS5 Pro Game Boost will improve over 8,500 backward-compatible PS4 games.

Industry reactions are mixed. The PS4 Pro's success was tied to 4K display adoption, but the PS5 Pro lacks a clear technological leap. Analysts predict 1.3 million sales in the launch window, potentially rising to 13 million by 2029, boosted by *Grand Theft Auto 6* in 2025.

Sony's move leaves the field open for Microsoft, rumored to be developing a portable Xbox to compete with handhelds like the Steam Deck. Console gaming is entering a costly phase, with prices reaching £800 for some devices.
