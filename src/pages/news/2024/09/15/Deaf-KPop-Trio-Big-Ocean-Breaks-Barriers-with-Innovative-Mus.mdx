Big Ocean, K-Pop’s first deaf boy band, is making waves. Comprised of Jiseok, Hyunjin, and Chanyeon, all with hearing loss, the trio uses sign language and AI to connect with fans. Their latest single, “Slow,” ranked No. 4 on South American charts.

The group debuted on South Korea’s national day for people with disabilities, April 20. “We want to turn our unexpectedness into a draw,” Jiseok said. They rely on cochlear implants, hearing aids, lip reading, and sign language.

Training involved flashing displays and vibrating watches to sync with music. AI helps correct and mix their voices.

Parastar Entertainment, South Korea’s only talent agency for people with disabilities, manages Big Ocean. CEO Haley Cha, inspired by her Paralympics coverage, founded the agency in 2020.

Cha sees Big Ocean’s live performances as their strength. “They turn music into something you ‘listen’ to with your eyes,” she said.

Big Ocean’s unique approach has boosted their social media following fourfold compared to other K-Pop debuts. Parastar is planning performances in Japan and an all-disabled musical.

“We want to show something fresh and cool that didn’t exist before,” Cha said.
