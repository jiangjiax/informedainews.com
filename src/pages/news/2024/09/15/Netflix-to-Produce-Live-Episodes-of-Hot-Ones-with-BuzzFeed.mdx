Netflix seeks to revitalize its talk show format by partnering with BuzzFeed to produce live episodes of "Hot Ones," a YouTube hit. The show, known for its spicy chicken wing challenges and celebrity interviews, has a loyal following. Netflix’s move into live content, including stand-up specials and reality TV reunions, aims to capitalize on the unpredictable drama of real-time reactions. This strategy could inject fresh energy into Netflix’s lineup, leveraging the show’s existing popularity and the allure of unedited celebrity moments.
