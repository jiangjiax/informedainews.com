The phrase "Go woke, go broke" doesn't hold up, according to a new study. Brands that align with progressive values, even awkwardly, often see sales boosts. The Unstereotype Alliance, backed by Oxford University researchers, analyzed 392 brands across 58 countries. They found that inclusive ads, free of stereotypes, give brands a 3.5% sales boost in the short term and over 16% in the long term.

Inclusive advertising persuades 62% of buyers to choose a product and makes 15% of shoppers more loyal. The study covered various product categories and geographies. Sara Denby of UN Women says the data should encourage brands to embrace inclusivity for both community benefit and financial growth.

However, some brands have stumbled. Burger King pulled an ad showing people eating burgers with chopsticks. Kendall Jenner and Pepsi faced backlash for a Black Lives Matter-themed ad. Bud Light faced criticism for featuring trans star Dylan Mulvaney. Benetton's 1990s ads, showing graphic scenes like child labor, also missed the mark.

Despite these missteps, the study suggests that inclusive advertising generally pays off. Brands should navigate modern values carefully but confidently.
