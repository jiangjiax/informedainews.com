The Shanghai Municipal Development and Reform Commission and other departments have issued a notice to regulate the charging fees for electric bicycles and promote the direct power supply of charging facilities by the grid. Grid companies are required to promptly upgrade eligible charging facilities to achieve direct power supply. By the end of 2024, operators of charging facilities in residential communities should complete their upgrade applications; by June 2025, grid companies should achieve direct power supply. New residential communities' charging facilities should generally be powered directly by the grid to avoid the cost escalation caused by intermediate supply.

**Explanation:**
- **Direct Power Supply by the Grid**: Refers to electricity being supplied directly to charging facilities by the grid company, reducing intermediate steps and lowering costs.
- **Intermediate Supply**: Refers to electricity being supplied through third parties or intermediate steps, potentially increasing costs.
