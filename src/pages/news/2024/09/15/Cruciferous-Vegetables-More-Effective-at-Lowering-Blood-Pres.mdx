A new study from Edith Cowan University reveals that cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and kale are more effective at lowering blood pressure than root vegetables. This could benefit heart health and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

In a randomized controlled crossover study, participants with hypertension who consumed four servings of cruciferous vegetables daily saw a significant drop in blood pressure compared to those who ate equal amounts of root and gourd vegetables.

Cruciferous vegetables contain glucosinolates, compounds shown to lower blood pressure in animals. They also have nitrates and vitamin K, which may offer additional benefits.

High blood pressure is a leading risk factor for heart disease, especially in older adults. Previous studies suggested that cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cabbage are more closely linked to reduced heart disease risk than other veggies.

However, cruciferous vegetables typically make up only a small portion of overall vegetable intake. Only about one in 15 Australian adults meets recommended vegetable intake levels, a figure that has been declining.

The six-week study involved two two-week dietary interventions with a two-week "washout" period in between. Participants ate either cruciferous or root vegetable soups for lunch and dinner. Blood pressure was measured before and after each intervention.

Eating cruciferous vegetables lowered blood pressure by 2.5 mmHg more than root vegetables. This reduction could lower the risk of heart attack or stroke by about 5%.

The Heart Foundation welcomed the findings, encouraging people to incorporate more cruciferous vegetables into their diets. They emphasized the importance of a heart-healthy diet rich in various vegetables.
