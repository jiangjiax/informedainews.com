The UK plans to ban online and TV ads for junk food starting October 2025. This aims to curb childhood obesity, affecting over 1 in 5 kids by primary school.

**What’s banned?**
Foods deemed “less healthy” by nutrient analysis and falling into 13 categories:
- Soft drinks, savory snacks, breakfast cereals
- Chocolates, sweets, ice cream, cakes
- Biscuits, morning goods, desserts
- Yoghurt, pizza, potatoes, ready meals

**Exceptions:**
- Infant formula, baby food, weight control products
- Meal replacements, food supplements, medicinal drinks

**Previous measures:**
- 2009: Junk food ads restricted during under-16 programs
- 2016: Soft drink tax reduced sugar content
- 2022: Calorie labeling in large eateries, supermarket display restrictions

**Global context:**
- Norway, Portugal, and the EU consider similar bans.
- UK’s obesity concerns date back to the 1990s.

**Insight:**
These measures reflect a societal shift towards healthier living. While effective, they must balance public health with economic impacts.
