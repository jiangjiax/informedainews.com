UEFA has threatened to ban England from the 2028 European Championship, which the country is co-hosting, due to concerns over a proposed independent football regulator. The regulator, planned by the UK government, aims to ensure financial sustainability in English football's top five tiers. UEFA fears this could lead to government interference, violating their rules against such meddling.

The regulator's role includes overseeing club licensing and strengthening the owners and directors test. However, UEFA's general secretary, Theodore Theodoridis, warns of potential "scope creep," where the regulator might expand its mandate beyond financial oversight, encroaching on football governance.

Theodoridis emphasizes the need to protect the Football Association's (FA) independence, stating that any legislation compromising the FA's autonomy would breach UEFA and FIFA statutes. He also raises concerns about clauses in the legislation that require the regulator to consider government foreign and trade policy objectives.

Despite these warnings, the UK government remains confident that the Football Governance Bill will benefit English football, ensuring its sustainability and putting fans at the heart of the game.
