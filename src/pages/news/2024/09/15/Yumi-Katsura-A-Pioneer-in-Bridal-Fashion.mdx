Yumi Katsura, Japan's pioneering bridal designer, passed away in April at 94. Instead of a funeral, her brand hosted a fashion show at Tokyo's Imperial Hotel in August. The event showcased 100 dresses, including the "world's lightest silk" wedding gown worn by model Ai Tominaga.

Katsura opened Japan's first bridal shop in 1965, when most brides wore kimonos. Her Yumi Line dresses, introduced in New York in 1981, feature elegant, mermaid-like silhouettes. The show also displayed her more extravagant designs, inspired by Japanese tradition.

Katsura's influence extends globally, with her brand sold in the U.S., Canada, China, and Myanmar. She organized the Asia Bridal Summit since the mid-1990s, fostering cultural exchange among Asian bridal industries.

In Japan, Katsura's dresses attract women of all ages. Saki Kakuta, a university student, admired their delicate craftsmanship. Kana Kurahashi, a former salesperson, praised Katsura's unwavering belief in her brand.

Last year, Katsura collaborated with Celford, a younger brand. The Yumi Katsura for Celford label met sales targets, earning up to 60 million yen in each of the 2023 sales seasons.

Katsura's legacy endures through her innovative designs and global impact, ensuring her place in bridal fashion history.
