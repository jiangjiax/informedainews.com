Thousands gathered in Uganda for the military funeral of Olympic athlete Rebecca Cheptegei, who died after her partner set her on fire. Cheptegei, a sergeant in Uganda’s army, was honored with a gun salute. She suffered 80% burns in the attack by Dickson Ndiema, who later died from his injuries. The couple argued over land Cheptegei bought in Kenya.

Cheptegei’s death highlights a troubling pattern of gender-based violence in Kenya, where four female athletes have been killed by their partners in recent years. Uganda’s First Lady, Janet Museveni, called the attack “deeply disturbing.” The National Council of Sports of Uganda condemned the act as “cowardly and senseless.”

In Kenya, 41% of women experience physical or sexual violence from their partners. Many Ugandan athletes train in Kenya, drawn by better facilities. Cheptegei, who competed in the Paris Olympics, was buried at her father’s homestead in Bukwo.
