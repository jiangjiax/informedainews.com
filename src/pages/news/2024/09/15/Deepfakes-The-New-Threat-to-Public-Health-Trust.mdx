Deepfakes—digitally manipulated videos—are now mimicking renowned doctors to peddle scams. Experts warn these fakes exploit trust, endangering public health.

---

**Key Points:**

1. **Deepfakes Explained:**  
   These are realistic, AI-generated videos that can convincingly impersonate anyone, including top medical professionals.

2. **Danger:**  
   Scammers use these fakes to promote bogus treatments, misleading millions. The risk? Misinformation leading to real health hazards.

3. **Trust Erosion:**  
   As people grow wary of doctored content, genuine medical advice could lose credibility.

---

**Insight:**  
In a world where truth is fluid, trust is the new currency. Deepfakes undermine this, blurring the line between fact and fiction. We must arm ourselves with skepticism and tools to verify authenticity. The fight against misinformation is not just technological; it’s a battle for our collective sanity.
