Malaysia plans to increase its sugar tax, aiming to curb diabetes and non-communicable diseases. The current tax, introduced in 2019, charges 0.5 ringgit per liter for sugary drinks. Health Minister Dzulkefly Ahmad announced a further increase, which will be detailed in the 2025 budget.

The existing tax has reduced sugar consumption by 9.25%. However, diabetes remains a significant issue, affecting 15.6% of adults. Obesity rates have risen from 44.5% to 54.4% since 2011.

Experts suggest expanding the tax to include refined sugars and high-fructose corn syrup. This could prevent consumers from shifting to alternative sugary sources.

The goal is to make sugar less appealing by increasing costs. While this won’t eliminate non-communicable diseases, it’s a step in the right direction. Education and awareness are next.

**Key Terms:**
- **Non-communicable diseases (NCDs):** Chronic illnesses like diabetes, hypertension, and obesity that are not contagious.
- **High-fructose corn syrup:** A sweetener commonly used in processed foods, contributing to high sugar intake.
