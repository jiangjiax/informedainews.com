Harvey Weinstein, the once-powerful Hollywood producer, faces new charges from a New York grand jury. The specifics are sealed. This follows his 2020 conviction for rape and criminal sex act, overturned in April due to procedural errors. Prosecutors plan to retry him on the same charges and possibly new ones.

Weinstein, 72, recently underwent heart surgery. Over 80 women have accused him of sexual assault or harassment; he denies all claims, insisting encounters were consensual. His retrial is set for November, though it's unclear if the new charges will be included.

In 2022, Weinstein was convicted in Los Angeles of rape and sexual assault, sentenced to 16 years. His team is appealing this verdict.

Weinstein and his brother, Bob, were influential in the 1990s and 2000s, producing films like "Pulp Fiction" and distributing Oscar winners. His downfall began in 2017 when women publicly accused him, sparking the #MeToo movement.
