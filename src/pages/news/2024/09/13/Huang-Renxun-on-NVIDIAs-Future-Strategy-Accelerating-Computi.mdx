Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, revealed in a Goldman Sachs tech dialogue that the company will continue to expand its production capacity in the fourth quarter and next year to meet the huge demand for the Blackwell chip. He emphasized Nvidia's advantages in algorithm optimization and architectural consistency, which can significantly enhance customer competitiveness.

Huang's comments drove Nvidia's stock price up 8.15%, adding $215.8 billion to its market value. He pointed out that with the end of Moore's Law, general-purpose computing has reached a bottleneck, and the future lies in accelerated data centers. He predicted that the world's trillion-dollar general-purpose data centers will be replaced by accelerated computing centers, achieving significant performance improvements and cost savings by accelerating core tasks.

Huang also mentioned that future computing will extend into skill enhancement areas, where generative AI technology will change the way we work, and digital assistants and AI tools will become indispensable partners in various fields. He expects the pace of innovation in the AI computing field to continue to accelerate, with Nvidia achieving significant performance improvements every two years, maintaining its market leadership.

**Key Term Explanations:**
- **Moore's Law**: An empirical rule proposed by Gordon Moore, one of the founders of Intel, stating that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit roughly doubles every two years, leading to corresponding performance improvements.
- **Accelerated Computing**: Significantly enhancing the speed of specific tasks through specialized hardware or software optimizations.

Huang's vision and strategy are clear; he not only focuses on current market demands but also looks ahead to future technological trends. This forward-thinking approach is key to Nvidia's continued leadership.
