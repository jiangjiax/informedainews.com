Manchester City, the reigning champions of the Premier League, face 115 charges for alleged financial rule breaches. The independent hearing begins Monday, billed as "sport's trial of the century." Expected to last 10 weeks, it could result in severe penalties, including relegation or expulsion. City denies the charges.

The case stems from allegations dating back to 2008, following the club's Abu Dhabi takeover. Portuguese hacker Rui Pinto, known for Football Leaks, claims to possess documents relevant to the case. Der Spiegel previously published leaked emails suggesting City inflated sponsorship revenue.

If found guilty, City risks a financial scandal, affecting their reputation and potentially Britain's relations with the UAE, where the club's majority owner, Sheikh Mansour, is from. A verdict in early 2025 will dictate the season's narrative.

Premier League CEO Richard Masters acknowledges the case's significance, stating it's "time now" for resolution. The hearing's outcome will test the league's authority and credibility amid existing challenges.
