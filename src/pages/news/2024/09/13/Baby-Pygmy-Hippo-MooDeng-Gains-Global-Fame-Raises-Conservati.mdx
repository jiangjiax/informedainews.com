Moo-Deng, a two-month-old pygmy hippo at Thailand's Khao Kheow Open Zoo, has become an internet sensation. Her wobbly antics, playful nibbles, and rosy cheeks have captivated millions online. Atthapon Nundee, her zookeeper, started sharing her videos during the pandemic, aiming to make her famous in Thailandâ€”but her fame spread globally.

Her popularity surged on TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram, with fans creating art and even a cosmetics trend inspired by her. Time magazine dubbed her an "Icon" and "Legend."

Moo-Deng's fame has boosted zoo visits but raised welfare concerns. Tourists have disturbed her sleep for photos, prompting zoo authorities to install CCTV and monitor her closely.

Pygmy hippos are endangered, with around 2,000 to 2,5000 remaining in the wild. Edwin Wiek of Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand argues that conservation efforts should focus on protecting their natural habitats rather than breeding them in zoos.

Atthapon hopes Moo-Deng's fame will raise awareness about pygmy hippos, encouraging people to support their conservation.
