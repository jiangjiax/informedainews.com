WADA's report absolved 23 Chinese swimmers of doping, despite Swiss prosecutor Eric Cottier's findings that Chinese officials broke rules. Cottier's report cleared WADA of bias but criticized China's antidoping agency for rule violations. The swimmers were quietly cleared in 2021, blamed on a contaminated kitchen, allowing them to compete in the Tokyo and Paris Olympics.

The report's release sparked controversy, with critics like Travis Tygart of the United States Anti-Doping Agency arguing WADA gave China special treatment. The report's findings were met with skepticism, and the underlying question of doping by Chinese athletes remains unresolved.

The WADA board meeting in Turkey was tense, with attempts to bar Dr. Rahul Gupta, a Biden administration official, from discussing the Chinese case. Gupta, representing over 40 countries, was eventually allowed to participate after WADA withdrew allegations against him.

The report's publication did not bring closure, as a U.S. criminal investigation continues, and Congress questions WADA's actions. The situation has strained relations between WADA and U.S. officials, raising broader concerns about the global antidoping system's efficacy.
