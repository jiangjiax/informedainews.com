Gallup's "State of the Global Workplace" report reveals that unhappy workers cost the global economy $8.9 trillion, or 9% of GDP.

Daily negative emotions—like loneliness, anger, and sadness—affect 20% of global workers. Stress impacts 41%. Remote workers and the disengaged are most affected.

Engaged employees, who find work meaningful, report higher life satisfaction. Disengaged workers suffer more than the unemployed.

Only 23% of employees are engaged, while 62% are disengaged. Employers must address this to boost both worker well-being and economic performance.
