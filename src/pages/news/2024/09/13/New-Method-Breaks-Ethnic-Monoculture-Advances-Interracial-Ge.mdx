Genetic research has long been biased towards populations of European descent, overlooking the genetic diversity of other ethnic groups. This limitation has resulted in the undiscovered presence of many important gene variations, hindering medical progress and health equity.

Professor Hailiang Huang's team has proposed a new method—SuSiEx, which successfully integrates multi-ethnic genetic data, enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of analysis. This method not only improves the limitations of traditional analysis but also provides a crucial foundation for personalized medicine and drug development.

The innovation of SuSiEx lies in its cross-ethnic data integration, enabling a more comprehensive capture of key gene variations across different populations. Particularly in regions like Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the method significantly improves data utilization efficiency, helping scientists gain a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic characteristics in these areas.

This research did not happen overnight but is based on nearly a decade of accumulated work by the team. Professor Huang has been focusing on the genetic research of non-European populations since his postdoctoral days, dedicated to enhancing the fairness and inclusiveness of global genetic research.

In the future, Professor Huang's research group plans to further expand the application of this method, especially in mixed populations. They will also delve deeper into complex diseases such as mental disorders and inflammatory bowel disease, striving to provide new strategies for clinical treatment.

This research marks an important step in the integration of multi-ethnic genetic studies, contributing to global health initiatives.
