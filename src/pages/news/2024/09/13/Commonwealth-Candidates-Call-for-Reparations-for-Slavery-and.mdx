Three candidates vying to lead the Commonwealth—from Gambia, Ghana, and Lesotho—have urged reparations for slavery and colonialism. At a Chatham House debate, they advocated for either financial reparations or "reparative justice."

Calls for reparations surged after George Floyd's murder in 2020, igniting global Black Lives Matter protests. African and Caribbean nations have since formed an alliance to pressure former slave-owning states.

Ghana’s Shirley Botchwey suggested the Commonwealth's role would depend on member governments. Lesotho’s Joshua Setipa supported "reparative justice," highlighting the Commonwealth's history in addressing racism. Gambia’s Mamadou Tangara backed reparatory justice, proposing the Commonwealth's convening power to facilitate dialogue.

The Commonwealth, born from the British Empire, comprises 56 nations, mostly former colonies. Despite being seen as a colonial relic, candidates argued it could address modern issues like climate change and youth unemployment.

The leadership vote will occur at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Samoa in October.

**Insights:**
The debate underscores a shift in global consciousness regarding historical injustices. The Commonwealth, often viewed through a colonial lens, now faces a pivotal moment. Its potential role in reparative justice could redefine its relevance and impact.
