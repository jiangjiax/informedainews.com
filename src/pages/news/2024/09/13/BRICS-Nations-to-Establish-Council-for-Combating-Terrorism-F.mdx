BRICS nations plan to form a council to combat terrorism funding, including money laundering. This follows a successful anti-terror working group session in Moscow. The council aims to share data on cyberattacks and streamline anti-corruption efforts. Russia, as the leading BRICS nation, emphasizes security, leveraging the group's experience in countering terrorism, extremism, and transnational crime. BRICS, initially comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, now includes Egypt, Iran, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Ethiopia.
