Indian Minister of Electronics and Information Technology, Ashwini Vaishnaw, announced that Apple's latest iPhone 16 is now being produced in India and will be available globally. This move signifies progress in Prime Minister Modi's "Made in India" initiative, aimed at creating iconic products for the world. Apple's expansion of production in India not only enhances global supply chain security but also diversifies production risks. The Indian government offers various policy supports, such as reducing import duties on mobile phone components, to attract global manufacturers. Apple plans to produce over 50 million iPhones annually in India, which could solidify its market position and propel India into becoming a global hub for smartphone production. This is expected to create numerous job opportunities and boost local economic development. Foxconn Chairman Young Liu clarified that the yield rate at Indian factories is far higher than the 50% reported by the media, meeting Apple's standards.
