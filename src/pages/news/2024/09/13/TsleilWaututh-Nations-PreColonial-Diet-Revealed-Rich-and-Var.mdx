A new study with the Tsleil-Waututh Nation and UBC reveals their pre-colonial diet was rich and varied, centered on salmon, forage fish, shellfish, and marine birds. The Burrard Inlet, now between Vancouver and the North Shore, sustained them for millennia with abundant marine life. The Tsleil-Waututh's stewardship ensured sustainable harvests.

Lead author Meaghan Efford notes the diet was high in protein, averaging over 200 grams per person daily, far exceeding modern recommendations. Marine fowl provided essential fats, mitigating health issues common in high-protein diets.

Michelle George, a Tsleil-Waututh specialist, emphasizes the continuity of their oral histories, which the study validates. Efford's research supports their claims, challenging Western science's dominance.

Recent restoration projects aim to revive the inlet's health, fostering marine life recovery. These efforts reconnect the community with their ancestral diet and culture, vital for preserving heritage.
