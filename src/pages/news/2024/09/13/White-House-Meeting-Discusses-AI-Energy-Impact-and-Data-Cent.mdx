OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google executives met at the White House to discuss the energy impact of AI. CEOs Sam Altman and Dario Amodei, along with Google's Ruth Porat, focused on data centers, semiconductors, and grid capacity.

An OpenAI spokesperson emphasized the need for U.S. infrastructure to support AI innovation. The company shared economic impact data with Biden-Harris officials, highlighting potential job and GDP growth in states like Wisconsin, California, Texas, and Pennsylvania.

The White House aims to strengthen U.S. AI leadership, ensuring data centers are built domestically. Commerce and Energy Secretaries Gina Raimondo and Jennifer Granholm attended, along with key advisors.

This meeting follows an August announcement where OpenAI and Anthropic agreed to allow the U.S. AI Safety Institute to test new models before public release. The institute, part of the Department of Commerce, aims to address safety and ethics concerns.

The Biden-Harris administration's October 2023 executive order on AI mandated safety assessments and research on labor market impacts. OpenAI is reportedly seeking a funding round valuing the company at over $150 billion, while Anthropic, backed by Amazon, is valued at $18.4 billion.
