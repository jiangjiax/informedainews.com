Shanghai, China's trendsetter, sees a rise in vegetarian and vegan dining. Once a city of meat-heavy meals, it now embraces plant-based cuisine. Celebrity chef Ken Hom notes a shift, driven by health and environmental concerns.

Vegetarianism in China is still niche, with only 4-5% of the population abstaining from meat, often for religious reasons. Yet, interest grows, especially among the educated youth. The China Vegan Society aims to cut meat consumption by 30% in a decade.

Shanghai leads this change. Vegetarian restaurants move beyond temple fare, offering diverse, often vegan, menus. Fu He Hui, a standout, requires reservations months in advance. Chef Tony Lu, a former meat lover, now explores rare plant ingredients, creating seasonal, minimalist dishes.

This shift reflects broader cultural changes, blending Eastern traditions with Western health trends. Shanghai's culinary evolution mirrors its rapid modernization, balancing old and new.
