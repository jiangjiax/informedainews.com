Lebanon braces for heightened violence after a series of explosive attacks targeting Hezbollah's communication devices. At least 37 dead, 3,000 injured. Hezbollah blames Israel; Israel remains silent.

Lebanon's Economy Minister Amin Salam warns of a perilous 48 hours ahead. Hezbollah, already engaged in daily skirmishes with Israel, vows retaliation, raising fears of all-out war.

The attacks, initially seen as targeting Hezbollah, have unified Lebanon against a common threat. Salam notes a "massive reaction" even among those normally opposed to Hezbollah.

Health Minister Firas Abiad details the strain on hospitals, with 2,800 casualties and 12 fatalities. Lebanon's fragile infrastructure and economy face further strain.

U.S. officials seek a diplomatic solution. Israel moves troops north, signaling a shift in focus from Gaza. Lebanon's government remains committed to avoiding war, but the escalation complicates diplomatic efforts.
