The Taitung millet dumpling incident led to 12 people suspected of food poisoning, with 3 fatalities. The Ministry of Health and Welfare found no pesticides in live snails during their inspection, but detected the highly toxic pesticide Thimet in leftover food samples. Relatives questioned whether the snails tested were from the same batch and suggested that the same batch of snails should be used for testing. Deputy Director Lin Jin-fu of the Ministry of Health and Welfare stated that the inspection samples included live snails, bloodwood, and leftover food samples, aiming to preserve evidence and should be coordinated with the actual investigation results.
