The U.S. health system ranks last among 10 wealthy nations, despite high costs. A Commonwealth Fund report highlights poor performance in equity, access, and outcomes. Dr. Joseph Betancourt, president of the Commonwealth Fund, sees daily human tolls: patients unable to afford medications, older patients sicker due to lack of insurance.

Healthcare costs dominate voter concerns, yet major reforms are absent from political agendas. Democratic and Republican nominees offer little change. Voters prioritize cost issues: drugs, doctors, and insurance. Americans spend over $13,000 per person annually on healthcare.

The report, part of the "Mirror, Mirror" series, compares the U.S. to Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the UK, Sweden, and Switzerland. The U.S. ranks poorly across all sectors except care process.

Reginald D. Williams II, vice-president of the fund, notes that other nations address social issues better, reducing strain on health systems. Recommendations include expanding insurance, reducing patient expenses, simplifying insurance plans, strengthening primary care, and investing in social well-being.

Dr. David Blumenthal, past president of the fund, acknowledges the challenge of changing the social contract. The upcoming election will shape the direction of U.S. healthcare.
