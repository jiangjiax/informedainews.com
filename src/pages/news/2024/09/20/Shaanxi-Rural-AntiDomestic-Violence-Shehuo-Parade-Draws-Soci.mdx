Yang Tao, a graduate in experimental art, organized an anti-domestic violence social fire parade in a rural area of Guanzhong, Shaanxi Province. She invited villagers to act out scenes of domestic violence, recreating violent images from news reports. The parade was titled "Beaten Wives, Kneaded Dough," inspired by a local saying that suggests wives become more obedient with beating, just as dough becomes smoother with kneading.

Yang Tao used flower-shaped steamed buns and social fire performances to artistically present the issue of domestic violence. She selected seven news stories on domestic violence, recreated the scenes with flower-shaped steamed buns, and invited villagers to play the roles of "seven couples," applying "domestic violence makeup" for the parade. During the performance, villagers gathered to watch, creating a chaotic yet impactful scene.

Yang Tao's actions sparked heated discussions online, with many people sharing their own experiences of domestic violence. She hopes that through art, more people will pay attention to the issue of domestic violence.

**Flower-shaped Steamed Buns**: A traditional Shaanxi pastry often used in festive celebrations, characterized by diverse shapes and vibrant colors.

**Social Fire**: A traditional folk performance in Shaanxi, Gansu, and other regions, typically held during festivals or celebrations, featuring mythological stories or historical legends.

Yang Tao's initiative is not just artistic creation but also social intervention. She exposed the harsh reality of domestic violence in a direct and powerful manner, raising public awareness. This combination of art and social issues showcases the power and responsibility of art.
