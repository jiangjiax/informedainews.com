Wang Tian, the former "Number One in Chinese Chess," was banned for life and stripped of all technical titles for buying and selling games and manipulating competitions. This move shocked the chess world, and Xinhua News Agency commented: "A blunder has been made, and regret comes too late."

In his youth, Wang Tian had publicly apologized for competing with falsified qualifications and promised to reform. However, 12 years later, he crossed the line again, manipulating competitions, betraying his profession, and violating the law.

This incident reveals long-standing ailments in the chess world and exposes loopholes in industry regulation. The Chinese Chess Association imposed severe penalties based on the "Sports Law of the People's Republic of China" and relevant judicial evidence, demonstrating progress in sports law.

Chess, as a gem of Chinese civilization, needs to strictly enforce competition discipline while actively reshaping its image and exploring development paths. Improving regulatory standards and creating a good competition environment are necessary measures to maintain fairness and justice in the chess world.

If this crisis can be transformed into a driving force for development, allowing the project to rebound, then bad things can potentially lead to good outcomes. Improving the living environment for project practitioners and expanding the project's influence will test the wisdom and strategic vision of project managers.
