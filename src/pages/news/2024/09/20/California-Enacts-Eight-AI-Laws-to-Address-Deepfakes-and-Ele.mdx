California’s Governor Gavin Newsom has signed eight AI-related laws, addressing issues from deepfake nudes to AI-generated political ads.

Two laws, SB 926 and SB 981, target deepfake nudes. SB 926 makes it illegal to blackmail with AI-generated nude images, while SB 981 mandates social media platforms to report and remove such content.

SB 942 requires AI-generated content to be disclosed in metadata, aiding public identification.

Three laws focus on election integrity. AB 2655 demands large platforms remove or label election-related deepfakes. AB 2839 criminalizes posting deceptive AI content about elections. AB 2355 mandates disclosures for AI-generated political ads.

Two laws protect actors. AB 2602 requires studios to gain actors’ consent for AI replicas. AB 1836 prohibits digital replicas of deceased performers without estate consent.

Newsom still has 30 AI bills to consider, including the contentious SB 1047. He emphasizes balancing real and hypothetical AI risks.

**Insights:**
California’s proactive stance on AI regulation is crucial. Addressing deepfakes and AI replicas safeguards individuals and elections. However, balancing innovation and regulation is challenging. Newsom’s approach, focusing on solvable issues, is pragmatic.
