The WNBA is booming, driven by stars like Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. Attendance, viewership, and merchandise sales are breaking records. Yet, top players earn modest salaries—Clark and Reese make around $76,000 and $74,000, respectively.

Valuations of the three most valuable teams—Las Vegas Aces, Seattle Storm, and New York Liberty—have soared 13 to 70 times their recent sale prices. A new 11-year, $2.2 billion media rights deal with Disney, Amazon Prime, and NBCUniversal kicks in 2026.

Despite this growth, WNBA players still earn far less than NBA counterparts. Brionna Jones, a seven-year veteran, makes $212,000, close to MVP winners A'ja Wilson and Breanna Stewart. Many players, like Jones, play overseas to supplement income.

The current collective bargaining agreement (CBA) runs through 2027, with an opt-out option in November. The league and players' union could renegotiate in 2025. WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert aims to boost player salaries, despite projected losses of $50 million this year.

The league has already invested $75 million from investors, adding charter flights and increasing playoff bonuses. While WNBA salaries lag behind men's sports, many believe it's just a matter of time before they catch up.
