During the National Day holiday, the museum boom continued, with many museums packed to capacity. The Shanghai Museum's "Summit of the Pyramids: The Great Exhibition of Ancient Egyptian Civilization" showcased 788 ancient Egyptian artifacts and extended its hours to accommodate the crowds. The Palace Museum launched the "The Path of Virtue: Special Exhibition on Confucian Culture" to commemorate the 2,575th anniversary of Confucius' birth. The Sanxingdui Museum's "In Search of Sanxingdui: Excavation Site of Sacrificial Pits" VR experience attracted numerous visitors. The Archaeological Park of the Han Dynasty Haihunhou Kingdom in Jiangxi Province closed its online ticketing channel and implemented crowd control measures due to reaching the maximum booking limit.

**Brief Analysis:**
The museum craze reflects the public's growing interest in history and culture. Exhibitions combined with technology, such as VR experiences, enhance interactivity. Crowd control measures ensure the quality of visits but require advance planning.
