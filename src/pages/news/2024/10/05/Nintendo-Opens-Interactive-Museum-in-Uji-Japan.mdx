Nintendo opened a museum in Uji, near Kyoto, showcasing its history and interactive games. The 10,000-square-meter space features exhibits from Nintendo’s past, including traditional Japanese card games and baby strollers. Visitors can play classic games like Super Mario using large controllers in pairs.

Shigeru Miyamoto, creator of Mario and Zelda, emphasized the museum’s purpose: to highlight Nintendo’s unique approach to game development. He noted that Nintendo’s strategy is to release products at the right time, aligning with a medium- to long-term vision.

The museum uses a coin system for interactive exhibits, aiming to manage visitor flow and offer diverse experiences. Miyamoto hopes to attract 1,500 to 2,000 visitors daily.

Miyamoto also discussed the museum’s role in revitalizing Uji, a city with an aging population. He drew parallels to Kyoto’s historical significance, emphasizing the need for constant innovation, akin to a river’s flow.
