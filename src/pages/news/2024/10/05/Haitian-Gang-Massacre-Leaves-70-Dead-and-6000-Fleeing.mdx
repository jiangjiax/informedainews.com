In the early hours of November 3, the Gran Grif gang, led by Luckson Elan, launched a brutal attack on Pont-Sonde, a rural area in Haiti's Artibonite region. The assault resulted in at least 70 deaths and forced over 6,000 residents to flee their homes. The gang claimed the massacre was retaliation for local passivity during police and militia operations that killed their members.

The United Nations migration agency reported that most displaced individuals sought refuge in nearby towns like Saint-Marc, while others found temporary shelter in makeshift camps. The Haitian government confirmed that the gang not only killed indiscriminately but also set fire to numerous homes and vehicles, marking one of the worst attacks in recent years.

Prime Minister Garry Conille condemned the violence, calling it an attack on the entire Haitian people. Security forces have since bolstered defenses in the area. The National Police replaced the local police chief and deployed additional forces to stabilize the situation.

Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, and its surrounding areas are largely controlled by armed gangs, leading to widespread hunger and homelessness. Despite international pledges, aid remains insufficient. Neighboring countries like the Dominican Republic and the United States continue to repatriate migrants, exacerbating the crisis.

Witnesses described the gang's methodical rampage, shooting residents and setting fires as they moved through the community. The RNDDH human rights organization warned that the death toll could be higher, as some families were entirely wiped out.

Pont-Sonde has long been a hotspot for violence, with residents pleading for enhanced protection. The Gran Grif gang, known for kidnappings, rapes, murders, and forced evictions, has frequently terrorized the area. Elan was recently added to the UN sanctions list.

The UN refugee agency cautioned that gang activity is obstructing humanitarian aid, leading to potential catastrophic shortages of food and medical supplies. Haiti has received only a fraction of the promised international support, with just over 400 officers deployed.
