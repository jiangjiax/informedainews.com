Doctors are celebrating a new drug combo that slows lung cancer progression by 40% longer than standard treatment. Lung cancer kills 1.8 million people yearly. Advanced cases fare worse.

In a global trial, patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and an EGFR mutation—common in women and light smokers—lived 23.7 months without disease progression on amivantamab and lazertinib. Standard treatment, osimertinib, offered 16.6 months.

Amivantamab is a monoclonal antibody; lazertinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Both target cancer cells. Combining them improved survival rates. The FDA approved the combo in August. UK availability hinges on NHS endorsement.

Side effects included rashes, infections, and blood clots. Precision medicine, tailoring treatments to genetic profiles, drives these advances.

Paula Chadwick of the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation calls new treatments "rocket fuel for hope." Anna Kinsella of Cancer Research UK sees a "golden age" of cancer research, improving lives and reducing fear.
