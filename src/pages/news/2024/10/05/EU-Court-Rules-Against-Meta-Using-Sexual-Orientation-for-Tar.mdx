The EU's highest court ruled that Meta cannot use a user's sexual orientation for targeted ads, even if the user is openly queer. This decision follows a case brought by Max Schrems, an Austrian privacy activist. Schrems argued that Meta violated EU privacy laws by collecting data on his sexual orientation from various online activities, using it to target LGBTQ-specific ads. Meta denies this practice, claiming it treats sexual orientation data as sensitive and does not indiscriminately use it for advertising.

Initially, an Austrian court allowed Meta to target Schrems based on his public statements about being gay. However, the EU court overruled this, stating that public statements do not permit tech companies to target sensitive ads. The court also supported Schrems' claim that Meta gathers data from beyond its social media platforms.

Meta asserts it takes privacy seriously and offers user settings to control data usage. Schrems' lawyer, Katharina Raabe-Stuppnig, emphasized the ruling's impact on Meta's extensive data pool, limiting its use for advertising despite user consent.

The ruling is significant, especially for LGBTQ+ individuals in countries where homosexuality is illegal. Targeted ads could out them, posing safety risks. While tech companies may profit from deducing sexual orientation, they cannot jeopardize users' safety for financial gain.
