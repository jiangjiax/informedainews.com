Amazon has not officially announced, but has invited the main cast of "The Lord of the Rings" to a London event, hinting at a renewal for Season 3.

Season 2 attracted 55 million viewers and received higher ratings than Season 1. The company paid $250 million for the rights and plans to produce five seasons with a total budget of $7 billion.

In the final episode of Season 2, the confrontation between Sauron and Calimac was not done with CGI but was filmed practically. Calimac's fall from the cliff was performed by the actor using a wire.

Calimac has a complicated relationship with Halbrand, who is actually Sauron in disguise. Sauron has acquired the nine human rings, hinting at the advancement of the One Ring plan in the next season.

Calimac will team up with Elrond and Gil-galad to confront the Dark Lord, with Gandalf joining the group.
