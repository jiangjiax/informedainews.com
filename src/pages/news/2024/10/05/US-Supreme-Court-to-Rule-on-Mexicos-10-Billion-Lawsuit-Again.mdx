The US Supreme Court will decide on a $10 billion lawsuit filed by Mexico against US gun manufacturers. Mexico claims these companies' negligent practices fuel violence by supplying drug cartels. The lawsuit names Smith & Wesson, Barrett Firearms, Beretta, Colt, Glock, and Interstate Arms.

Mexico asserts that 70% of trafficked weapons come from the US, contributing to 17,000 homicides in 2019. The damage, they say, equals 1.7-2% of Mexico’s GDP. The firearms industry denies these claims, arguing Mexico’s crime is its own responsibility.

The case has faced multiple court rulings. Initially dismissed, it was revived by a US appeals court. Now, the Supreme Court will review the gunmakers' appeal, who argue their practices are lawful.

Mexico’s lawyers defend their case, stating US gunmakers knowingly sell to “straw buyers” who supply cartels. Smith & Wesson counters that Mexico seeks to bankrupt the US firearms industry with a “novel and far-fetched” claim.

This isn’t the first time US guns have been blamed for destabilizing foreign nations. A UN report estimates half a million weapons have flooded into Haiti since 2020. The US plans a new policing unit to address this issue.
