Plaifah Kyoka Shodladd, a 19-year-old Thai-Japanese LGBTQ activist, has been recognized by Time magazine for her role in Thailand's same-sex marriage legislation. Born to a Thai father and a Japanese mother, Plaifah spoke in the Thai parliament, advocating for marriage equality. Thailand is set to become the first Southeast Asian nation to legally recognize same-sex marriages, starting in January. Plaifah hopes this will inspire neighboring countries to reconsider their laws and societal norms. Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra was also named on Time's list, making history as the youngest premier of Thailand.
