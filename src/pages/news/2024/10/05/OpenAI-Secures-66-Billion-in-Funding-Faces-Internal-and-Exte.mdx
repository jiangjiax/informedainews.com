OpenAI secures $66 billion in fresh funding, valuing the AI giant at $1570 billion. Thrive Capital leads the round, with Microsoft, Nvidia, and others joining in. The infusion aims to bolster OpenAI's research and expand its user base, which now exceeds 2.5 billion weekly.

The funding comes with conditions: conversion to equity hinges on OpenAI transitioning to a for-profit entity, shedding its non-profit board's control. This shift could also grant CEO Sam Altman equity for the first time. Current investors face a 100x profit cap, but this may change.

Thrive Capital gains a unique deal: if OpenAI meets revenue targets, Thrive can invest an additional $10 billion next year at the same valuation.

OpenAI reportedly pressures investors to shun competitors like Anthropic, xAI, and SSI. Elon Musk criticizes this move on Twitter.

OpenAI's recent exodus of key personnel, including CTO Mira Murati, fuels speculation about internal turmoil. Despite this, Altman insists the departures are unrelated to the restructuring.

In essence, OpenAI's bold moves reflect the high stakes and rapid evolution in the AI sector. The company's trajectory will be closely watched as it navigates these complex waters.
