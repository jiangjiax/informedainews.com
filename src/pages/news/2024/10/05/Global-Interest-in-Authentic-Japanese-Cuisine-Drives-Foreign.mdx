TOKYO — Foreign chefs and restaurateurs are flocking to Japan to learn authentic Japanese cuisine. Sushi, ramen, and yakitori are in high demand.

David Ann, an Australian, spent 528,000 yen ($3,650) on a 7-Day Ramen Master Course. He aims to open a ramen restaurant. The course teaches clear chintan broth, a key ramen component.

Shigekatsu Akimoto, president of Shoku No Dojo, founded the school in 2013. Over 300 international students have graduated. Demand has surged, leading to instructor shortages.

In Kagawa prefecture, famous for udon, Yamato Manufacturing runs a noodle school. 14% of students are from overseas. A five-day udon course costs 220,000 yen.

Christopher Gunson, an American in Dubai, opened Maru Udon in 2020. His authentic udon has three locations.

Frontier Zipang in Yokohama offers izakaya cooking classes. A weeklong group class costs around $2,900. Demand is high for yakitori and izakaya dishes.

Daiya Yoshikawa, Frontier Zipang’s director, aims to preserve Japanese culinary heritage. Courses are held in real restaurant settings.

Professional chefs like Luz Sahamara Cadeno Marquez, a Mexican head chef, also enroll.

The influx of foreign restaurateurs reflects a global hunger for authentic Japanese flavors. These courses offer not just culinary skills but business insights, crucial for success abroad.
