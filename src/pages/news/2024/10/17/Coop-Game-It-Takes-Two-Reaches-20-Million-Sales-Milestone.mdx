Hazelight Studios' co-op game, *It Takes Two*, has sold over 20 million copies. The team is surprised and grateful. Each sale supports two players, meaning over 40 million people have played. The game excels in cooperative mechanics, often ranking in Steam's top five. Recently, it became Steam Deck compatible, simplifying invites and removing the need for EA's app launcher. However, EA account linking remains for online play.
