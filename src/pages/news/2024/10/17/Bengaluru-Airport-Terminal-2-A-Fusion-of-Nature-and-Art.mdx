Bengaluru’s Kempegowda International Airport Terminal 2 is more than just an airport; it’s a “terminal in a garden.” Spanning 255,000 square meters, the terminal is a lush, green oasis with over 10,000 square meters of green walls, hanging gardens, and outdoor spaces. It’s a tribute to Bengaluru’s heritage as a garden city, designed with sustainability in mind—solar power and rainwater harvesting reduce energy use by nearly 25%.

But the terminal’s true heart lies in its art program, inspired by navarasa, the nine essential emotions in Indian aesthetics. Forty-three artists created 60 works that reflect Karnataka’s cultural heritage and the navarasa principles. These artworks, from traditional sculptures to contemporary installations, are meant to evoke emotions and provide a sense of tranquility.

The terminal’s unique blend of nature and art has earned it accolades, including a special prize in UNESCO’s Prix Versailles competition. It’s not just a place to transit; it’s a destination in itself, offering travelers a moment of reflection and rejuvenation amidst their journeys.
