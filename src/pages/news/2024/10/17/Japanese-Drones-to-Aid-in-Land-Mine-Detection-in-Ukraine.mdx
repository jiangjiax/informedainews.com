Nagoya-based Prodrone, a Japanese drone manufacturer, is preparing to detect land mines in Ukraine. They are collaborating with Tokyo's Padeco, a development consulting firm, to commercialize the project by fiscal 2025.

Prodrone's drones will fly just 50 centimeters above the ground, scanning for metal. AI will help differentiate between harmless objects and land mines. The plan is to outsource equipment development and drone operations to a Ukrainian company.

The drones aim to map mine locations, which is crucial for Ukraine, where a quarter of the land is potentially mined. This technology could revolutionize mine detection, currently a dangerous task for humans. In 2022, Ukraine saw 600 casualties from anti-personnel mines, second only to Syria.

Prodrone's project, announced in June, seeks grants from the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). An initial $400,000 grant is expected by November, with a potential follow-up of $6.45 million. The goal is to deploy 1,000 drones in Ukraine by fiscal 2025.

Padeco emphasizes the need for private sector involvement in Ukraine's long-term recovery. Prodrone's CEO, Shunsuke Toya, envisions drones as a potential export industry for Ukraine, aiding its economic revival.

**Key Terms:**
- **UNIDO:** United Nations Industrial Development Organization, focused on promoting industrial development in developing countries.
- **ODA:** Official Development Assistance, government-funded aid to support economic and social development in developing countries.
