Raytheon, a major US defense contractor, will pay over $950 million to settle charges related to defective pricing, foreign bribery, and export control violations. The company is alleged to have defrauded the US government on military contracts and bribed officials in Qatar to secure business. This settlement resolves investigations under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), Arms Export Control Act (AECA), and International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).

**Explanation:**
- **FCPA:** US law prohibiting the bribery of foreign officials.
- **AECA & ITAR:** US regulations governing the export of military technology.
