The number of Chinese migrants crossing the Darien Gap—a perilous jungle route between Colombia and Panama—has plummeted. In September, only 124 Chinese made the journey, a stark drop from 1,240 in June. The Darien Gap, notorious for its dangers, saw a 36% decline in overall migrant crossings in the first nine months of 2024.

Ecuador, a key entry point, suspended its visa waiver for Chinese travelers in July, after noticing many overstaying their 90-day limit. This move effectively choked the flow of migrants heading north to the U.S. Panama, under President Jose Raul Mulino, has also ramped up deportations of migrants with criminal records, funded by the U.S.

Brazil has tightened its transit rules, addressing the surge of travelers abusing its visa-free policy to seek asylum en route to the U.S. The issue of migration is a hot-button topic in the U.S. presidential election, with both major parties taking firm stances.
