The world faces a dire water crisis. By 2049, over half of global food production could fail. Water scarcity already plagues half the world’s population, a number set to rise with climate change. Demand will outstrip supply by 40% by 2030.

Experts underestimated water needs. People require 4,000 liters daily for decent living, far more than the 50-100 liters for health. Most regions can’t meet this locally, relying on trade.

“Green water” (soil moisture) and “blue water” (rivers, lakes) differ. Atmospheric rivers transport moisture globally. China and Russia benefit most, while India and Brazil export.

Sustainable forest management in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and the Baltic region supports China’s economy. Brazil supplies Argentina with fresh water. This interconnectedness demands global cooperation.

Countries must act now. Radical thinking on water preservation, efficient use, and equitable access is crucial. Equity between rich and poor is essential.

The Global Commission on the Economics of Water, formed in 2022, warns of unprecedented water stress. Climate change exacerbates droughts, floods, and fires. Every 1°C rise in temperature adds 7% more moisture to the atmosphere, intensifying the hydrological cycle.

Harmful subsidies distort water systems. Over $700 billion annually supports agriculture, often encouraging wasteful practices. Industry recycles only 20% of wastewater.

Subsidies must be redirected. Poor people need support, not industry and the wealthy. Developing countries require financial aid to overhaul water systems and protect natural environments.

The water crisis disproportionately affects women. Urgent, equitable action is imperative.
