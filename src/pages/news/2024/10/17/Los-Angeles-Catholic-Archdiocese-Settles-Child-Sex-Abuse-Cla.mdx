The Los Angeles Catholic archdiocese agreed to pay $880 million to 1,353 abuse victims. Archbishop Jose H Gomez expressed deep regret. The settlement, the largest by a U.S. diocese, aims to provide healing. California's new law allowed past abuse claims to be re-litigated. The archdiocese avoided bankruptcy by using reserves, investments, and loans. Payments won't affect its mission to serve the poor. Both sides thanked survivors for coming forward, emphasizing accountability.
