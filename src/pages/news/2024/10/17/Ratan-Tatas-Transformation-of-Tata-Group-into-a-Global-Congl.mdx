Ratan Tata transformed Tata Group into a global force. From 1991 to 2012, he spent $20 billion on over 50 acquisitions. Key purchases included British tea maker Tetley and Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus.

Tata’s vision was clear: global expansion. He saw potential in diverse sectors—steel, cars, consumer goods, technology. His strategy paid off. Tata Group’s revenue surged from $6 billion to $100 billion. International revenue reached $59 billion.

Not all deals were perfect. Corus, acquired for $12 billion, struggled post-2008 crisis. Yet, Tata’s foresight reshaped the conglomerate. He modernized the Tata brand, aligning it with the new economic era.

Liberalization in India, starting in 1991, empowered Tata. It allowed private investment, a stark contrast to earlier nationalization policies. This shift enabled Tata to venture globally as domestic business thrived.

Today, Tata Group is ubiquitous. It spans tea, cars, aviation, retail, semiconductors, and more. Global giants like Apple, Starbucks, and Zara partner with Tata for Indian operations.

Tata’s legacy is profound. He turned a trading company into a global conglomerate, setting the stage for future growth. His vision and boldness continue to define Tata Group’s trajectory.
