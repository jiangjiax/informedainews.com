China plans to inject 4 trillion yuan ($562 billion) into its struggling property sector by year-end. This move aims to stabilize the market, focusing on unfinished housing projects. The government will expand a "white list" of eligible developments, guiding bank lending. As of now, 2.23 trillion yuan has been approved, with expectations for at least 4 trillion yuan by 2024's end.

The "three red lines" policy, introduced in 2020, restricted lending, causing a prolonged downturn. Many developers faced liquidity issues, defaults, and failed to deliver homes. The white list mechanism, initiated in January, helps some developers secure loans for unfinished projects.

Despite recent stimulus measures, including rate cuts and lower mortgage costs, analysts warn that reversing the sector's decline—historically a quarter of China's economy—is crucial for broader economic recovery. The impact on property investment and construction will take time to materialize.

China's stock markets initially reacted positively but later dipped, reflecting uncertainty. The government's efforts aim to stabilize but face challenges in immediate market confidence and long-term recovery.
