South Koreans, once shunning Japanese beer, now guzzle it. Asahi's Super Dry, in a can mimicking draft beer, drew 8,000 guests in Seoul. Sales surged eightfold from 2020.

Asahi's joint venture with Lotte Chilsung now sells premium Asahi Shokusai in a similar can. Sapporo's Premium Beer saw a 57% sales jump in 2024, a twelvefold rise from 2020. Suntory's pop-up bars in Seoul also boosted sales.

Japan's beer exports to South Korea quadrupled to 8.2 billion yen in 2023, making it the top destination. This year, exports rose 20%, accounting for 37% of Japan's total.

Political tensions in 2019 led to a boycott, slashing beer exports to 500 million yen in 2020. Despite this, overall beer consumption in South Korea only dipped 4% in 2020.

The shift reflects a broader trend: consumers often prioritize quality over politics, especially in premium markets.
