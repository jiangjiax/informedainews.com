Bangkok, 2024: The pandemic reshaped Thailand’s culinary landscape. Vivin, a once-thriving importer of European delicacies, faced a 90% business collapse due to COVID-19 restrictions. Yet, this crisis birthed a new era of local luxury food production.

Thais, becoming more health-conscious and environmentally aware, turned to local ingredients. Vivin pivoted, offering Thai-sourced gourmet items. Celebrity chef Ian Kittichai, for instance, swapped Japanese fish for Phuket’s catch. This shift wasn’t just survival; it was a “food awakening.”

Vivin’s grocery-cum-restaurant in Bangkok’s Asok district flourished. Demand surged for local products like Sloane’s guanciale and Jartisann cheese. This trend extended to other sectors, notably chocolate, with Kad Kokoa’s single-origin Thai cocoa gaining traction.

Generation Z, in particular, champions sustainability and transparency. Research shows they are keen on knowing their food’s origin. This mindset is reshaping the food industry, making local, sustainable products mainstream.

Joe Sloane, a British chef-turned-meat producer, notes a stark contrast from his arrival in Thailand 17 years ago. Back then, imported ingredients were a status symbol. Now, the narrative has flipped.

The pandemic’s silver lining? A culinary revolution, rooted in local flavors and sustainable practices. Thailand’s food scene, once dominated by imports, now celebrates its own gourmet treasures.
