Dr. Rebecca Portnoff, VP of data science at Thorn, uses AI to protect children from sexual abuse. She started as a volunteer and now leads a unique team focused on this mission. Inspired by "Half the Sky," she dedicated her PhD research to combating child sexual abuse with AI.

Her team at Thorn identifies victims, stops revictimization, and prevents the spread of abuse material. They spearheaded the Safety by Design initiative to prevent generative AI from harming children. Portnoff emphasizes the urgent need for comprehensive federal laws to address AI-generated nonconsensual sexual images.

In a male-dominated field, Portnoff advises women to be prepared, confident, and assume good intentions. She stresses the importance of ethical AI, involving diverse stakeholders, and ensuring transparency and fairness.

Investors should prioritize ethical commitments in AI startups. Portnoff believes in collective action to build AI that safeguards the vulnerable. Her work underscores the critical role of responsible AI in protecting children.
