In October, during the golden autumn season, Xi Jinping visited a strategic missile unit in the Jianghuai region, where he inspected the troops with a history of over 50 years. Under the guidance of Xi Jinping's thought on strengthening the military, the unit has accomplished numerous significant tasks.

Xi Jinping thoroughly examined the development of the unit and the training of its officers and soldiers, inspected the newly upgraded main combat weaponry, and encouraged the troops to train diligently to ensure mastery of their weapons. He emphasized the need to deepen political rectification, uphold the Party's absolute leadership over the military, and ensure that the troops are fully obedient to the Central Committee of the Party.

Xi Jinping called for intensified training and preparedness to enhance combat capabilities and safeguard national strategic security. He pointed out that it is necessary to adapt to the modern warfare form, strengthen training on new equipment, new skills, and new tactics, and systematically develop practical combat capabilities.

This inspection once again highlighted Xi Jinping's emphasis on the political construction and practical readiness of the military, reflecting a high level of attention to national security.
