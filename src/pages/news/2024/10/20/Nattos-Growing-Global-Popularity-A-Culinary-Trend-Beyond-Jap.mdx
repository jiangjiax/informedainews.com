Natto, Japan's fermented soybeans, are gaining global fans. Exports hit a record 1.9 billion yen in 2023. Social media buzz and innovative recipes are driving interest.

In Tokyo's Shimokitazawa, Natto Kobo Sendaiya sees a surge in foreign customers. Manager Satoshi Nagatsuka notes a 10% increase, with visitors from China, South Korea, Thailand, the U.S., and France. A French visitor likens natto to cheese, finding it unexpectedly tasty.

Sendaiya promotes baked natto doughnuts, emphasizing their non-smelly appeal. The plain doughnut, at 170 yen, retains a subtle natto aroma. Nagatsuka aims to attract those put off by natto's gooeyness and smell.

Natto exports doubled from 2017 to 2023, with significant growth since 2020. Indonesia's #nattochallenge videos showcase exaggerated reactions to natto's smell, followed by positive reviews. Fitria, an Indonesian resident, now enjoys natto in salads.

The Japan Natto Cooperative Society Federation reports natto's popularity in South Korea, Thailand, and China due to familiarity with fermented soybean foods. In the West, vegan trends have boosted natto consumption. TerraZen Centre in Amsterdam serves natto-based sushi rolls and salads, blending it with avocado, tomatoes, and olive oil.

Natto's global appeal hinges on innovative recipes. Experts suggest integrating natto into salads, but more creative uses are needed to truly win over foreign palates.
