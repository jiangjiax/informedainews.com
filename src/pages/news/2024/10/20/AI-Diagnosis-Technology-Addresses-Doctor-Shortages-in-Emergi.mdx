Japanese startups are utilizing AI to tackle doctor shortages in emerging markets such as Thailand and Brazil. Lpixel, headquartered in Tokyo, is launching an AI-based tuberculosis diagnostic system in Thailand, with the goal of deploying it in 100 facilities within three years. The AI analyzes chest X-ray images to identify signs of the disease, which is crucial for the early detection of tuberculosis, a significant health concern in Southeast Asia.

AI Medical Service is implementing an endoscopy AI system in Brazil and ASEAN countries to assist in the diagnosis of stomach cancer. Brazil, with its substantial Japanese-descendant population, offers a conducive environment for such technology. The system, already in use in Japan, streamlines diagnosis in areas with limited medical infrastructure.

Japan's proficiency in stomach cancer and endoscopy, combined with its advanced AI technology, positions it well to support these markets. The global medical imaging market, driven by AI-compatible devices, is expected to grow substantially, particularly in emerging countries where doctor shortages are common.

**Key Terms:**
- **Endoscopy:** A medical procedure to examine the interior of the body using an endoscope.
- **ASEAN:** Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a regional intergovernmental organization.
- **Endoscopist:** A medical professional trained to use endoscopes.
