23andMe, once a leader in DNA testing, now teeters on the brink. A data breach in 2023 exposed the genetic data of nearly 7 million users, leading to a $30 million lawsuit settlement. The company’s value has plummeted by over 99% since its 2021 peak, driven by dwindling interest in its test kits and subscription services.

CEO Anne Wojcicki initially considered selling the company but later opted to take it private, causing a mass resignation of board members. This uncertainty raises concerns about the fate of the genetic data of its 15 million customers.

Unlike healthcare providers, 23andMe isn’t bound by HIPAA, the federal law protecting health information. Instead, it relies on its own privacy policies, which can change at any time. The company’s data is a valuable asset, potentially sold in a merger or bankruptcy. Wojcicki has hinted at marketing this data to pharmaceutical companies, shifting focus from drug development.

Privacy advocates urge users to delete their accounts, though 23andMe retains some data even after deletion, such as genetic information for compliance purposes. Over 80% of users have consented to data sharing for research, which cannot be fully reversed.

In short, 23andMe’s future is shaky, and so is the security of its users’ genetic data.
