Biden's administration has forgiven $175 billion in student loans for nearly 5 million borrowers. This latest round, $4.5 billion for 60,000 public service workers, fixes a loophole in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. PSLF, initiated in 2007, had only benefited 7,000 before Biden took action. The total forgiven debt under Biden exceeds any previous president's efforts. Additionally, the administration has streamlined relief for 572,000 disabled borrowers and 1.6 million defrauded by their colleges. A one-time recount of past payments ensures accurate relief eligibility.
