G7 defense ministers met in Naples, pledging "unwavering support" for Ukraine. They vowed to continue military aid, backing Kyiv’s path to NATO membership. Ukraine’s President Zelenskyy proposed a "victory plan" to end the war, but NATO allies remain cautious.

France supports Zelenskyy’s plan, aiming to compel Russia to negotiate. However, the US, crucial for broader support, may delay decisions until after the November election.

Ukraine and Russia continue air attacks. Kyiv repelled a Russian assault, while Ukraine targeted Moscow and western Russia with drones.

A video surfaced, allegedly showing North Korean troops receiving Russian military gear. US Defense Secretary Austin expressed concern, warning of potential escalation.

Britain’s Foreign Secretary urged China to halt military supplies to Russia, highlighting global implications.
