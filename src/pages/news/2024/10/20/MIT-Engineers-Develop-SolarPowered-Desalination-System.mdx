MIT engineers have developed a solar-powered desalination system that adapts to sunlight variations, producing up to 5,000 liters of water daily. Unlike traditional reverse osmosis systems, it requires no batteries or grid power. Tested in New Mexico, it efficiently desalinated brackish groundwaterâ€”a resource more common than fresh groundwater.

The system's success lies in its ability to harness over 94% of solar energy, making it a viable solution for communities with limited access to fresh water and grid power. Amos Winter, a professor at MIT, calls this a "massive grand challenge" that they've overcome.

The researchers aim to commercialize the technology, focusing on reliability and scalability. Funding came from the National Science Foundation, the Julia Burke Foundation, and industry partners like Veolia and Xylem Goulds.

This innovation could revolutionize water access in inland areas, providing a sustainable, low-cost solution to water scarcity.
