The venom of the black widow spider contains seven toxins, among which α-latrotoxin is toxic to vertebrates. This toxin disrupts nerve signals, leading to muscle spasms.

Research from the University of Münster has revealed the complex mechanism of α-latrotoxin. After binding to nerve cell receptors, the toxin forms calcium channels, allowing calcium ions to flow in and trigger muscle contractions.

The study, utilizing cryo-electron microscopy and molecular dynamics simulations, found that the toxin molecules form a stalk-like structure that penetrates the cell membrane, creating small pores that act as calcium channels.

Professor Christos Gatsogiannis noted that α-latrotoxin mimics the function of calcium channels, differing from known toxins. The research findings were published in *Nature Communications*.

This study not only unveils the toxin's mechanism but also demonstrates its potential in the medical and biotechnological fields, such as developing antidotes and biological pesticides.
