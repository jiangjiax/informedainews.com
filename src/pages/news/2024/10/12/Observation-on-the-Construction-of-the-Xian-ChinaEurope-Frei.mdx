Xi'an, the starting point of the ancient Silk Road, has become the leading city for China-Europe班列 nationwide since the first train was launched in 2013. In 2023, the annual operation volume of Xi'an's China-Europe班列 exceeded 5,000 trains, accounting for a quarter of the national total, and it has maintained its top position in the country for six consecutive years.

The China-Europe班列 (Xi'an) has shifted from "point-to-point" transportation to "hub-to-hub" operations, serving the national westward opening-up strategy. In 2023, the first customized train from Xi'an to Belgrade successfully launched, marking more precise service.

Xi'an International Port Station has become the largest railway logistics center in northwest China, with an average of one China-Europe班列 entering or leaving every 1 hour and 40 minutes. The National Development and Reform Commission supports the construction of demonstration projects for China-Europe班列 assembly centers in five cities, including Xi'an, to promote the formation of an efficient collection and distribution system.

The operation of the Kazakhstan-Xi'an Terminal has improved the efficiency of shipments on the Xi'an-Central Asia班列, becoming a new highlight of Sino-Kazakh trade cooperation. Upon completion, the Sino-Kazakh logistics yard project will upgrade the "hub-to-hub" cooperation between the two countries.

The Xi'an Assembly Center for China-Europe班列 has significantly improved its operational efficiency and reduced comprehensive costs by more than 15% through measures such as infrastructure improvement and international logistics channel expansion. Service functions have been optimized, with customs clearance time reduced from 5-7 hours to within 5 minutes.

The China-Europe班列 has brought new opportunities to Shaanxi's foreign trade, with the total value of import and export trade increasing by 15.8% in the first eight months of 2023. Goods such as new energy vehicles and photovoltaic modules are shipped in full sets via the China-Europe班列, leading to a significant increase in freight volume.

The Trans-Caspian China-Europe (Asia)班列 has become a new growth point, with a year-on-year increase of 24 times. Xi'an is actively participating in the construction of the Trans-Caspian International Transport Corridor, deepening cooperation with countries along the route, and building an efficient and convenient transportation system.

The development of Xi'an's China-Europe班列 not only enhances logistics efficiency and reduces transportation costs but also provides strong support for Shaanxi and other inland regions to deeply integrate into the grand pattern of the Belt and Road Initiative.
