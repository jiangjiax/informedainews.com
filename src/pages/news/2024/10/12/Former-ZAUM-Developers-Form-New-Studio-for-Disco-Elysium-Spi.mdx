ZA/UM's sequel to "Disco Elysium" has been canceled, and some former team members have established a new studio in London called Longdue, developing a "spiritual successor." The new project explores the interaction between consciousness and the subconscious, set in a world where the character's psyche intertwines with the environment. Rostov and Kurvitz are not involved, and the narrative director, Grant Roberts, comes from Bungie and Rocksteady, having previously worked at Sweet Baby Inc. Roberts emphasizes the need for more teams like Sweet Baby in the industry.

**Explanation**:
- **BAFTA Award**: British Academy Film and Television Arts Award, recognizing achievements in film, television, and games.
- **Spiritual Successor**: A non-official sequel that retains the spirit of the original work but is independently developed.
- **AAA Game**: High-budget, high-quality large-scale game.
