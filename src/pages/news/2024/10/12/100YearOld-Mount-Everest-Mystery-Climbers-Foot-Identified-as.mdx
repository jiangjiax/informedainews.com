A century after British climbers George Mallory and Andrew “Sandy” Irvine vanished on Everest, a climber’s foot, identified as Irvine’s, has been found. The discovery, made by Jimmy Chin, includes a boot and sock with a label reading “AC Irvine.” Mallory’s body was found in 1999, but Irvine’s remains had eluded searchers until now.

The foot was found at a lower altitude than Mallory’s body, suggesting Irvine may have fallen further. Mallory’s body bore rope marks, hinting at a fall, but the absence of a photograph he intended to leave on the summit raises the possibility that they reached the top. Irvine, who was 22, was believed to be carrying a Kodak camera, which could resolve whether they summited, but it remains missing.

Julie Summers, Irvine’s great-niece, expressed deep emotion at the discovery, having lived with the mystery since childhood. The find provides closure for the family and the climbing community, offering a clue to what happened on that fateful day in 1924.

The remains are now with the China Tibet Mountaineering Association. Prof Joe Smith of the Royal Geographical Society praised the discovery, noting Irvine’s significant contribution to Everest exploration.
