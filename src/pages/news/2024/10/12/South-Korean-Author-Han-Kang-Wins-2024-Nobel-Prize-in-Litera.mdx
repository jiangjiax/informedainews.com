Han Kang, South Korea's first Nobel laureate in literature, won the 2024 prize for her poetic prose. Her work confronts historical trauma and human fragility. Anders Olsson, Nobel Committee chair, praised her innovative style and unique insights into body and soul.

Kang began her career in 1993 with poetry and debuted in prose in 1995. Her international breakthrough came with *The Vegetarian* (2007), which won the Man Booker International Prize in 2016. Two of her books have been adapted into films.

Her novel *Your Cold Hands* (2002) explores a sculptor's obsession with female bodies. *Greek Lessons* (2011) was her latest English release.

The Nobel Prize, worth 11 million Swedish krona ($1.45 million), was created by Alfred Nobel in 1901. Past literature winners include Rudyard Kipling, Ernest Hemingway, and Bob Dylan. The prize is awarded on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death.
