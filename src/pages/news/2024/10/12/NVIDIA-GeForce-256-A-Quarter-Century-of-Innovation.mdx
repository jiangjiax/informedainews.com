In 1999, NVIDIA unveiled the GeForce 256, a GPU that few noticed but many now revere. It laid the groundwork for today's AI revolution.

The GeForce 256 wasn't just a graphics card; it was the world's first GPU, introducing hardware T&L (Transform and Lighting). This technology shifted the focus of game development to GPUs, sparking innovations in realism and performance.

By 2011, AI researchers began utilizing NVIDIA GPUs for deep learning, accelerating the rise of AI. In 2016, NVIDIA donated the first DGX-1 AI supercomputer to OpenAI, leading to the debut of ChatGPT in 2022.

NVIDIA's journey from a budding tech firm to a trillion-dollar giant underscores the profound impact of the GeForce 256. The revolution it started continues to reshape gaming and AI.
