The FBI created a fake Ethereum token, NexFundAI, to investigate cryptocurrency scams.

Three market makers and nine individuals are facing SEC charges for inflating crypto prices.

Eighteen more individuals are facing DOJ charges for "fraud and manipulation."

The defendants allegedly lied about the tokens and used "wash trades" to fake market activity.

FBI's Jodi Cohen refers to it as a "new twist on old-school financial crime."

**Wash trades**: Buying and selling the same asset to create false trading volume.
