Labubu, a character from Chinese toy brand Pop Mart, has become a sensation in Thailand. Its popularity surged after Thai superstar Lisa of BLACKPINK showcased it on Instagram. This celebrity endorsement sparked a buying frenzy, driving up prices and creating scarcity.

Pop Mart's strategy in Thailand includes opening themed stores and leveraging local influencers. Their Bangkok store broke sales records, earning over 10 million baht in a single day. The company attributes this success to timing and effective market entry.

Pop Mart's international expansion began in South Korea in 2018, evolving from wholesale to direct-to-consumer (DTC) models. By 2021, they focused on Southeast Asia, starting in Singapore. Their approach involves assessing market potential through social media engagement and e-commerce sales.

Despite competition from brands like 52 TOYS and TOP TOY, Pop Mart's early entry and strong IP portfolio give them a competitive edge. However, maintaining this momentum requires continuous innovation and adaptation to local markets.

Pop Mart aims to replicate their Thai success in other regions, focusing on tourist cities and expanding their global footprint. Their ultimate goal is to build a "Chinese Disney," emphasizing storytelling and emotional connection with consumers.

In summary, Pop Mart's success in Thailand highlights the power of celebrity endorsements and strategic market entry. Their ability to adapt and innovate will be crucial in sustaining this growth and achieving their long-term vision.
