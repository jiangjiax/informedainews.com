Nihon Hidankyo, Japan’s atomic bomb survivors’ group, won the 2024 Nobel Peace Prize. Formed in 1956, the organization advocates for a world free of nuclear weapons. The Norwegian Nobel Committee cited their relentless efforts to raise awareness about the catastrophic consequences of nuclear use.

This is the second Nobel Peace Prize for Japan, following Eisaku Sato in 1974. Sato, a former prime minister, signed the nuclear arms Non-Proliferation Treaty.

Tomoyuki Minomaki, Nihon Hidankyo’s president, expressed hope that the award would prompt global attention and action against nuclear weapons. He highlighted the growing nuclear threat, urging the United Nations to lead the charge for disarmament.

Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba praised the award, recognizing the group’s long-standing commitment to nuclear abolition.
