Podcasts are booming. People love them for tasks like walking the dog or raking leaves. Now, Google’s NotebookLM lets you turn articles into podcasts. Upload text, ask questions, and get an audio conversation. It’s like having a chat about your favorite topics.

I tried it with two Macfilos articles. The system created realistic dialogues. The voices sounded human, with natural pauses and enthusiasm. It’s impressive, but podcasts lack one thing: you can’t see the photos.

NotebookLM is a game-changer. Imagine uploading all Macfilos articles and asking about Leica M-cameras. The tech behind it? Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro Large Language Model. It’s AI vertigo—that feeling of disbelief at what machines can do.

The 2024 Nobel Prize for Physics went to Geoffrey Hinton and John Hopfield. They laid the groundwork for neural networks, the heart of today’s AI revolution. Who knew their work would lead to a Macfilos podcast?

Give it a try. You might feel that twinge of vertigo too.
