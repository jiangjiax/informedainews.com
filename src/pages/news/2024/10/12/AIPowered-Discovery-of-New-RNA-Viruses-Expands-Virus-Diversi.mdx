Sun Yat-sen University and Alibaba Cloud have collaborated to publish research in the journal _Cell_ using artificial intelligence technology, revealing 180 ultra-clusters and over 160,000 species of RNA viruses worldwide, expanding our understanding of viral diversity. The study also uncovered viral "dark matter," opening new avenues for virology research. Professor Shi Mang emphasized that AI plays a significant role in disease prevention and the identification of new pathogens, and the future will continue to leverage cloud computing and artificial intelligence to tackle challenges in life sciences.

RNA viruses: A class of viruses that use RNA as their genetic material, such as influenza viruses.
Viral "dark matter": Refers to virus species that are not widely recognized or studied.
