FTX creditors will receive $1.19 for every dollar lost. A Delaware judge approved the payout plan, totaling over $14 billion. The bankruptcy estate, valued between $14.7 and $16.5 billion, aims to return 100% plus interest to non-governmental creditors. This marks the largest and most complex bankruptcy asset distribution in history. FTX sold assets, including a $900 million stake in AI startup Anthropic, to raise funds. Founder Sam Bankman-Fried was convicted and sentenced to 25 years.
