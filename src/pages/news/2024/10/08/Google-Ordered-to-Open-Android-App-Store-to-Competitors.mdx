A U.S. judge has mandated that Google must open its Android app store to competitors for a period of three years, beginning in November 2024. The ruling prohibits Google from requiring the use of its payment system for apps on the Play Store and permits developers to propose alternative payment methods. Google is also barred from offering incentives for app exclusivity or sharing revenue with potential competitors. Additionally, the company is restricted from paying device manufacturers and carriers to secure exclusive access to the Play Store.

**Explanation:**
- **App Store Exclusivity:** Ensuring that only one app store is used on a device.
- **Payment System:** The method used to charge users for apps and in-app purchases.
