NASA's Europa Clipper, the largest spacecraft designed for planetary missions, has been moved to SpaceX's hangar at Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39A. The spacecraft, encapsulated in a payload fairing for protection, will be mounted on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket.

The fairing shields the spacecraft from aerodynamic pressures and heat during launch, eventually detaching and falling back to Earth. Soon, technicians will align the spacecraft with the rocket, prepare for launch, and then roll the rocket to the pad, elevating it vertically before liftoff.

Scheduled for October 10 at 12:31 PM EDT, the mission aims to explore Jupiter's icy moon Europa, assessing its potential to support life. The solar-powered Europa Clipper will orbit Jupiter, making nearly 50 close flybys of Europa to capture high-resolution images and data of its icy shell and subsurface ocean.

Led by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and managed by Caltech, the mission collaborates with Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Project management is overseen by NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, with launch operations managed by NASA's Launch Services Program at Kennedy Space Center.

Each component works in harmony to prepare for this mission, which promises to unveil the mysteries beneath Europa's icy surface and its potential for extraterrestrial life.
