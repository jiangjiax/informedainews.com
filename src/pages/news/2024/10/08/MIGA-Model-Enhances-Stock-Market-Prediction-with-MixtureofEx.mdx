Stock market prediction is challenging. Current models employ a single large model for all stocks, but this approach is ineffective due to the variability among stocks. MIGA, a new model, utilizes "experts"â€”specialized models tailored to different types of stocks. It enhances performance by allowing these experts to share information. MIGA outperforms other models, particularly on Chinese indices like CSI300. It demonstrates a 24% annual return, which is 8% higher than previous models. This approach has the potential to revolutionize stock prediction.
