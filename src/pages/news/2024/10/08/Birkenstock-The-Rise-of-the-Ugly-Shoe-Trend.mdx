Early autumn saw Birkenstock shoes unexpectedly gain popularity. On Douyin, the topic "Crocs Retire, Birkenstock Take Over" went viral. The German brand Birkenstock, with its century-long history, especially caught the public's eye. Its iconic toe-capped sandals, though deemed ugly, are expensive, opening up the "ugly shoe" market. In 2023, Birkenstock's sales exceeded 10 billion yuan. A Beijing store is in the works, and it is now known alongside Crocs and UGG as the "Three Kings of Ugly Shoes."

Birkenstock originated in Germany in 1774 and was once exclusive to royalty and nobility. In the 19th century, Konrad Birkenstock innovated the shoe design, laying the foundation for the Birkenstock brand. In the 1970s and 1980s, it became a staple among hippies. In 2021, LVMH's fund acquired a 70% stake, and in 2023, Birkenstock went public on the NYSE with a market value exceeding 63 billion yuan.

Birkenstock is known for its relaxed feel and practicality, often referred to as the "fashionable version of Zulijian." 70% of American consumers own at least two pairs, with an average of 3.6 pairs per person. A pair of Birkenstock Arizona sandals once worn by Steve Jobs was auctioned off for 1.55 million yuan.

In the Chinese market, Birkenstock has set up flagship stores on WeChat Mini Program, Tmall, JD.com, and Douyin. The best-selling model on Tmall is priced at 1,299 yuan, with over 20,000 people adding it to their carts. The third-quarter 2024 financial report showed a 36% surge in revenue in the Asia-Pacific, Middle East, and Africa markets.

The "ugly shoe" trend reflects a new generation's consumption attitude: seeking relaxation, individuality, and comfort. "Ugly shoes" provide emotional value and have become part of fashion trends. The middle class uses them as a brief escape to achieve self-satisfaction. The consumer retail industry is ever-changing, and seizing the moment is crucial.
