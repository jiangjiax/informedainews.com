Google announced three new AI-driven search features.

First, Lens now processes videos and voice queries. Users can record a video, ask a question, and receive an AI-generated response with relevant links. This feature is currently in testing.

Second, Circle to Search now identifies songs in videos. Android users can click a musical note icon to have Google’s AI analyze the audio and provide song information. Available on select devices.

Third, Google’s AI organizes search results for recipes and meal ideas. Results are categorized into subtopics, enhancing usability. This update starts this week in the U.S. on mobile.

These features leverage AI to make search more intuitive and efficient. Google continues to integrate AI into its core services, aiming to provide more accurate and relevant information.
