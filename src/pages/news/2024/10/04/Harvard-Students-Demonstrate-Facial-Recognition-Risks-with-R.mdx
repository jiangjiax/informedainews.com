Two Harvard students, AnhPhu Nguyen and Caine Ardayfio, have demonstrated a chilling capability: using Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses to perform real-time facial recognition, pulling up personal details like names, addresses, and phone numbers of strangers. Their project, I-XRAY, combines Meta's smart glasses with PimEyes' facial recognition software. PimEyes, a public facial recognition search engine, scans the web for images matching a face, providing a gateway to personal data.

The students chose Meta's glasses for their inconspicuous design and affordability, highlighting the ease with which such technology can be misused. Meta acknowledged that any camera-equipped device could be adapted for this purpose, not just their glasses.

To protect yourself, Nguyen and Ardayfio suggest contacting data brokers like PimEyes and FastPeopleSearch to remove your information. PimEyes offers an opt-out page for image removal, and FastPeopleSearch provides forms for data deletion.

This project underscores the potential for abuse in today's tech landscape, even when intentions are noble. It serves as a stark reminder of the importance of privacy measures in an increasingly digital world.
