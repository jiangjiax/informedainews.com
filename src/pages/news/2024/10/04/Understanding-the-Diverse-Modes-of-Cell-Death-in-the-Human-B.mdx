Billions of cells die daily in our bodies, each with its unique exit. Originally, scientists thought cells died only by accident (necrosis) or neatly (apoptosis). But now, over 20 distinct death modes exist.

**Necrosis**: Unplanned, messy death due to injury, infection, or disease.

**Apoptosis**: Neat, silent death, essential for development and tissue maintenance.

**Necroptosis and Pyroptosis**: Violent deaths signaling immune response. Necroptosis is a mix of apoptosis and necrosis; pyroptosis is a loud, inflammatory death.

**PANoptosis**: A hybrid death combining elements of apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis, crucial for immune response.

**NETosis**: Immune cells create DNA nets to trap pathogens, sometimes dying in the process.

**Cuproptosis and Ferroptosis**: Deaths triggered by copper or iron overload, potentially useful in cancer treatment.

**Entosis**: Cancer cells burrow into others, sometimes dying, other times surviving.

Understanding these death modes could lead to treatments for infections, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. Life and death are intertwined, each a part of the other.
