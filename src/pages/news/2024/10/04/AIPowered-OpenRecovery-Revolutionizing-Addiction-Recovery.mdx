OpenRecovery is revolutionizing addiction recovery with an AI-powered assistant. This tool provides 24/7 personalized support via text and voice, bridging the gap between expensive inpatient care and generic self-help programs.

The system utilizes LangGraph, a multi-agent architecture, to tailor support for various stages of recovery. Each agent is equipped with specialized prompts, ensuring precise guidance. LangGraph’s graph structure allows for efficient reuse of components, maintaining consistency and scalability.

LangGraph Cloud simplifies deployment and rapid iteration. The OpenRecovery team can quickly debug and update agent interactions, adapting to user needs and new recovery methods.

Human-in-the-loop features enhance trust and accuracy. The AI prompts users for deeper introspection, requesting human confirmation when necessary. Users can edit AI-generated summaries, ensuring data accuracy and control.

LangSmith accelerates development by enabling collaborative prompt engineering. Non-technical teams and experts can modify prompts, test them, and deploy revisions seamlessly. This observability helps identify and correct failure points, ensuring continuous improvement.

OpenRecovery’s approach combines AI precision with human empathy, making expert-level recovery support accessible. As they expand to new modalities like voice interactions, their impact on addiction recovery is poised to grow.
