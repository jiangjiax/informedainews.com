Miami Dolphins, valued at $7.1 billion, are in talks to sell a minority stake to Ares Management and billionaire Joe Tsai. The deal, including Hard Rock Stadium and event rights, is estimated at $8.1 billion. A controlling stake would exceed $10 billion.

Ares, managing $450 billion, aims for a 10% share, while Tsai, owner of the Brooklyn Nets, seeks 3%. This marks the NFL's first private equity investment since new finance rules in August.

Stephen Ross, Dolphins' owner since 2009, plans to reinvest proceeds in South Florida real estate and sports. Ross, also CEO of Related Companies, benefits from stadium revenue, hosting events like the Miami Grand Prix and Miami Open.

The NFL, traditionally resistant to private equity, softened its stance due to rising valuations. Tsai, with a growing sports portfolio, adds to his empire with this potential acquisition.
