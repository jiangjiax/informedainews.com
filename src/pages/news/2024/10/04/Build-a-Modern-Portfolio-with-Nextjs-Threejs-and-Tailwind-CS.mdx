Creating a standout portfolio involves more than just listing skills; it requires engaging design and interactive elements. This tutorial on freeCodeCamp’s YouTube channel teaches you to build a responsive portfolio using Next.js, Three.js, and Tailwind CSS. It’s suitable for all skill levels, aiming to add unique features to your site.

You’ll learn to integrate 3D models with react-three-fiber and react-three-drei, enhancing your portfolio’s visual appeal. AI-generated images from Playground AI will further elevate your site’s aesthetics. The tutorial also covers converting 3D models into JSX components using Gltf JSX, simplifying integration into React projects.

Beyond visuals, you’ll display GitHub activity and stats dynamically, using GitHub ReadMe Stats and GitHub Readme Streak Stats. Custom fonts from Google Fonts and icons from Lucide Icons will refine your site’s look. Interactivity is boosted with Sonner notifications and react-hook-form for seamless user input.

Advanced topics include smooth animations with framer-motion, email handling with Emailjs, and a Sound component for user interaction. The tutorial covers project setup, layout customization, and optimization for all devices.

Key tools and technologies:
- Next.js for structure and performance.
- Three.js with react-three-fiber and react-three-drei for 3D elements.
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design.
- Framer-motion for animations.
- Emailjs for email functionality.
