Design patterns are battle-tested solutions for common coding issues. They make code reusable and easier to maintain. A new 12-hour course on freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel teaches these patterns, turning beginners into advanced OOP programmers.

The course covers:
- Fundamental OOP concepts like inheritance and encapsulation.
- UML for visualizing class relationships.
- SOLID principles for better design.
- 23 "Gang of Four" patterns, divided into behavioral, structural, and creational categories.

Dan Adams, the instructor, ensures each topic is explained with practical examples. This course is a must for anyone serious about software development.
