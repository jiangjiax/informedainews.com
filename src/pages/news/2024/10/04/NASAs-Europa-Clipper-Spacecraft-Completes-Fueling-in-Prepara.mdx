NASA's "Europa Clipper" spacecraft has completed fueling at Kennedy Space Center, marking a crucial step toward its mission to Jupiter's moon Europa. The spacecraft will orbit Jupiter, closely passing Europa to gather data. Its propulsion module, the largest NASA has built for a planetary mission, houses 24 engines and over 6,000 pounds of fuel. These engines will power the craft through gravity assists from Mars and Earth, aiming to reach Jupiter by 2030.

The launch is set for October 10, aboard a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket. Europa Clipper carries advanced instruments to study Europa's ice shell, potential subsurface ocean, and geological features. The mission, managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), involves collaboration across multiple NASA centers.

**Key Terms:**
- **Gravity Assist:** A maneuver using a planet's gravity to alter a spacecraft's trajectory and speed.
- **Propulsion Module:** The part of the spacecraft containing engines and fuel for propulsion.

This mission aims to explore Europa's potential to support life, leveraging cutting-edge technology and international collaboration.
