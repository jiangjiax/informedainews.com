Federal prosecutors allege that Donald Trump committed crimes in his unsuccessful bid to retain power after losing the 2020 election. A recent court filing, unsealed following a Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity, contends that Trump is not immune from prosecution.

Special counsel Jack Smith’s team submitted the 165-page document, likely the final detailed case before the November 5 election. Trump faces four criminal charges, including conspiracy to obstruct the certification of the election and interference with voter rights.

Prosecutors aim to demonstrate that their remaining allegations against Trump can withstand the Supreme Court’s broad immunity ruling for former presidents. New evidence, including witness interviews and grand jury testimonies, will be disclosed during the trial.

Senior Trump administration officials, such as former Vice President Mike Pence and White House Chief-of-Staff Mark Meadows, testified before the grand jury. Trump’s lawyers opposed the filing, arguing that it is inappropriate so close to the election.

The presidential race is tight, with Vice President Kamala Harris leading in national polls. Swing states show more complex, tight races. If Trump wins, he may direct the Justice Department to drop the charges.
