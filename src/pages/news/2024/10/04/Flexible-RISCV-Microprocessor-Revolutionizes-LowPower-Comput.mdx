Pragmatic Semiconductor has developed the Flex-RV, an ultralow-power 32-bit microprocessor based on the RISC-V architecture. Unlike traditional silicon chips, Flex-RV is made from indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO), a flexible semiconductor that can be printed onto plastic at low temperatures. This innovation eliminates the need for costly protective packaging required for silicon chips in flexible applications.

The Flex-RV is designed to be programmable, capable of running software written in high-level languages like C. It includes a machine learning hardware accelerator, making it suitable for AI applications. With a core area of 17.5 square millimeters and approximately 12,600 logic gates, the chip operates at up to 60 kilohertz while consuming less than 6 milliwatts of power.

Flex-RV's flexibility allows it to function correctly even when bent to a radius of 3 millimeters, with performance varying by only a few percent. This makes it ideal for implantable devices, on-skin computers, and soft robotics.

Pragmatic's goal is to democratize computing by offering a license-free microprocessor, potentially reducing costs to less than a dollar. This could revolutionize wearable healthcare electronics and smart package labels, among other applications.
