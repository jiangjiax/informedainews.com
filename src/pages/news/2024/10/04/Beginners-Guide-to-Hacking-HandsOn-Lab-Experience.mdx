Hacking your first machine is a crucial step in cybersecurity. It’s not just about watching tutorials; it’s about hands-on experience. I’ve set up a lab on TryHackMe (THM) to help you do just that.

THM simplifies the process, offering virtual labs you can access directly from your browser. No complex setups needed. Sign up for a free account and dive into the lab. The URL is [here](https://tryhackme.com/jr/SS_HYFM).

The lab is divided into five tasks:

1. **Platform Overview**: Learn how THM works. Start the target and attack machines, then test the connection.

2. **Linux 101**: Brush up on basic Linux commands. Commands like `whoami`, `pwd`, `ls`, and `cat` are essential.

3. **Scanning with Nmap**: Use Nmap to scan the target. Nmap helps identify open ports and services, crucial for finding entry points.

4. **Brute-forcing with Hydra**: Once you find an entry point, use Hydra to brute-force the password. Hydra is a tool that tries multiple passwords until it finds the right one.

5. **Wrapping Up**: Provide feedback on the lab. Your input helps improve future labs.

The lab is a safe space to practice. No need for a premium account. Just sign up, start hacking, and gain valuable experience.

Happy hacking.
