45,000 dockworkers in the United States went on strike, causing 36 ports to shut down. This is the first time in 50 years, with far-reaching implications. Daily economic losses are as high as $5 billion. Global supply chains are disrupted, inflationary pressures are intensifying, and the path for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates is clouded. Foreign clients may turn to other suppliers, and commodity prices could rise. The strike has paused, but the crisis remains unresolved.

**Explanation:**
- **Dockworkers**: Workers at ports responsible for loading and unloading cargo.
- **Supply chain**: The entire process from production to consumption of goods.
- **Federal Reserve**: The central bank of the United States, responsible for monetary policy.
