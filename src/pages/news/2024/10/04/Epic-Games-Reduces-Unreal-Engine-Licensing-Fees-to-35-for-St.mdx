Epic Games reduces Unreal Engine licensing fees to 3.5% for games launching on its store starting in 2025. This "Launch Everywhere with Epic" initiative benefits cross-platform titles, excluding iOS due to ongoing Apple policy disputes. The strategy aims to attract developers, potentially challenging Steam's market dominance.

**Unreal Engine**: A powerful game development tool.
**Epic Games Store**: A digital storefront for games.
**Steam**: A major competitor in digital game distribution.
