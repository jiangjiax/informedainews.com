Britain will return the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, ending a long-standing dispute. The UK expelled Chagossians in the 1960s and 1970s, retaining the islands as the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT). Mauritius has long argued for sovereignty, a position supported by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the UN General Assembly, and the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea (ITLOS). Britain was found to have unlawfully separated the islands before Mauritius's independence. Despite initial resistance, the UK has now agreed to return the islands.
