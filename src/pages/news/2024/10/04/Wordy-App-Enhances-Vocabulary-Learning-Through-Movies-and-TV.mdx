Wordy, an iOS app developed by Budapest-based developer Sándor Bogyó, assists users in learning English by translating and defining unfamiliar words while they watch movies or TV shows. The app features over 500,000 titles, including popular series such as HBO’s “The Penguin” and Disney+’s “Agatha All Along.”

Bogyó created Wordy after encountering difficulties with unfamiliar English phrases while watching shows. Inspired by the Chrome extension Language Reactor, he developed a mobile solution. The app utilizes AI to analyze subtitles and identify spoken sentences through the phone’s microphone, ensuring synchronization with the video.

Each episode includes a summary page with words categorized by difficulty, ranging from Beginner to Proficiency English. Users can save words to practice later using digital flashcards. Wordy integrates data from TMDB and OpenSubtitles.com for accurate subtitles.

During testing with Netflix’s “Wednesday,” the app accurately translated sophisticated terms like “plagued” and “séance.” Currently available in English only, Wordy plans to introduce Spanish in November, followed by French and German. The app is priced at $2.99 per month or $29.99 per year, with an Android version set to launch in November.

Bogyó prioritizes quality over speed, ensuring that each language integration meets his standards.
