Zhang Ruimin, former chairman of the board of directors of Haier Group, spent 40 years transforming a small factory on the brink of bankruptcy into a global enterprise with annual revenue exceeding 370 billion yuan. Drawing on the wisdom of Confucius, Sun Tzu, and Laozi, he drove corporate innovation.

Zhang believed that the internet eliminates distance, necessitating the evolution of enterprises into ecosystems. He advocated the concept of "zero distance," enabling autonomous innovation from users to products to functional departments.

His office houses 5,000 books, and he reads more than two books a week, with a wide range of interests. He dislikes socializing but is passionate about engaging with scholars, believing that conversations should be enlightening.

In 1984, Zhang took over Qingdao Refrigerator General Factory, facing significant challenges. He borrowed from Confucian teachings to enact 13 management "military regulations," galvanizing the workforce. He smashed 76 defective refrigerators, changing workers' mindsets.

He studied The Art of War, applying strategic thinking to successfully propel Haier into global competition. He insisted on creating自主品牌, enduring 26 years of losses before achieving higher profit margins in overseas markets than through OEM.

Entering the internet era, he drew on Laozi's Tao Te Ching, advocating the concept of "nothingness," empowering employees by decentralizing authority. He believed that in chaotic times, dynamic and non-linear thinking is essential.

Zhang's success lies in aligning with the times and continuously reinventing himself. His management practices are unprecedented and serve as a model for corporate innovation.
