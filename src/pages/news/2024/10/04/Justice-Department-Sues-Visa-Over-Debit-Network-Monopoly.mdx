The U.S. Justice Department has sued Visa, accusing it of maintaining an illegal monopoly over debit payments. The suit claims Visa used "exclusionary" agreements to stifle competition and inflate fees, costing consumers and merchants billions. Attorney General Merrick Garland stated that Visa's monopoly affects the price of "nearly everything."

Visa, with over 60% of U.S. debit transactions, charges over $7 billion annually in processing fees. The DOJ alleges Visa threatened merchants and banks with higher rates if they used competitors, maintaining a dominant position. Visa's agreements with tech giants like Apple and PayPal, designed to neutralize potential threats, also stifled innovation.

Visa called the suit "meritless," arguing it operates in a competitive market with thriving new entrants. However, the DOJ seeks court intervention to prevent Visa's anticompetitive practices.

This lawsuit comes amid heightened regulatory scrutiny of payment networks. Recent deals, like Capital One's acquisition of Discover, aim to challenge Visa and Mastercard's dominance. The outcome could reshape the payment landscape, impacting fees and innovation.
