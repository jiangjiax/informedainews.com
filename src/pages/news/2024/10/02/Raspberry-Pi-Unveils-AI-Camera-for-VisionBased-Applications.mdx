Raspberry Pi introduces the AI Camera, a $70 add-on featuring on-board AI processing. Based on a Sony image sensor and Raspberry Pi's RP2040 chip, it captures and processes images using neural network models. Unlike previous modules, this one keeps the host Raspberry Pi free from visual data processing, allowing multitasking. The AI Camera is compatible with all Raspberry Pi models and comes pre-loaded with an object detection model for real-time use.

**Explanation:**
- **RP2040:** A microcontroller chip by Raspberry Pi, efficient yet inexpensive.
- **Neural network models:** Algorithms that mimic the human brain's processing for tasks like image recognition.
- **Object detection model:** A type of neural network that identifies and locates objects within images.
