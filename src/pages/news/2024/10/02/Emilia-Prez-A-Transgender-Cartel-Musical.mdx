"Emilia Pérez" is a film about a transgender cartel boss who undergoes gender-affirming surgery. Directed by Jacques Audiard, it won the Jury Prize at Cannes. The story follows Emilia, formerly Manitas, who seeks to escape her violent past by faking her death and starting anew.

Zoe Saldaña plays Rita, a defense attorney who helps Emilia. The film blends musical numbers with a gritty cartel narrative, exploring themes of identity and redemption. Emilia's journey involves complex moral dilemmas and social commentary on gender dysphoria and societal expectations.

Audiard's film raises questions about the mind, body, and soul, particularly how physical transformation impacts one's sense of self. The use of male pronouns for Emilia before her surgery highlights the divide between her past and present identities.

While some critics note potential gaps in understanding trans issues by the predominantly cisgender creative team, the film's exploration of Emilia's internal conflict and societal pressures offers a nuanced portrayal. The energetic musical sequences contrast with the film's darker themes, creating a dynamic and thought-provoking experience.
