In September, China's automotive market experienced a surge in sales, driven by the growth of new energy vehicles (NEVs). Leading the charge, Li Auto delivered over 53,000 vehicles, marking its first month with deliveries exceeding 50,000 units. Its market share in the 200,000 RMB+ NEV segment reached 17%, surpassing traditional luxury brands such as Mercedes, BMW, and Audi.

Xiaopeng Motors also set a new monthly delivery record with 21,352 units, thanks to the popularity of its MONA M03 model. The company is now focusing on expanding production to meet demand.

Lantu Motors delivered 10,000 vehicles, driven by the success of its new Dreamer model. The brand has seen continuous growth, with an average selling price of 336,000 RMB.

Other brands like Leapmotor, Zeekr, and Xiaomi also reported strong sales figures. Leapmotor entered the 30,000 units/month club, Zeekr delivered 21,333 vehicles, and Xiaomi is on track to meet its annual delivery target of 100,000 units.

The market frenzy was further fueled by a wave of new model launches. Over 50 new vehicles were introduced in September alone, as brands vied for market share during the traditional "Golden September, Silver October" sales period.

This surge in activity reflects the rapid evolution of China's automotive industry, with NEVs and smart technologies reshaping consumer preferences and market dynamics.
