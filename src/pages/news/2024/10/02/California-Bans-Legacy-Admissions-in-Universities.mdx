California has banned universities from admitting students based on family connections, affecting both public and private non-profit institutions like Stanford and USC. This law, effective September 2025, aims to level the playing field by prioritizing hard work and merit over legacy or donor ties.

Legacy admissions, often dubbed "affirmative action for rich kids," have long favored wealthier, less racially diverse student bodies. The move follows the Supreme Court's ban on race-based affirmative action, which highlighted the inequities of non-racial preferences.

Advocacy groups view this as a crucial step toward dismantling unfair practices. Stanford reported that 15.4% of its 2023 incoming class benefited from legacy or donor connections, though all met academic standards. USC admitted 14.5% based on such relationships.

Governor Gavin Newsom emphasized fairness, stating that higher education should be accessible through merit and hard work. The public University of California system eliminated legacy admissions in 1998.

The impact of this law remains uncertain, as wealthy families still possess numerous advantages in the competitive admissions process. The end of affirmative action for racial minorities is expected to further challenge underrepresented students' access to elite institutions.
