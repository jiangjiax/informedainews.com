Dockworkers at 14 U.S. East and Gulf Coast ports went on strike October 1, 2024, demanding wage increases and opposing automation. The strike threatens $3 trillion in annual trade, potentially devastating the economy.

Matthew Shay, National Retail Federation CEO, warns of higher consumer prices due to limited supplies and increased demand for imported goods. The strike comes amid a fragile economic recovery and post-Hurricane Helene hardship.

Inflation has slowed but not reversed; August's consumer price index rose 2.5% year-over-year. Lauren Saidel-Baker, ITR Economics economist, predicts the strike could reignite goods-side inflation.

The strike echoes the 2020 pandemic supply chain crisis, where goods shortages drove up prices. Lisa DeNight, Newmark managing director, emphasizes that the strike's duration amplifies its impact.

Amir Mousavian, University of New England supply chain professor, notes that perishable goods like coffee and bananas will see immediate price hikes. Longer strikes could raise costs for pharmaceuticals, apparel, and automobiles, ultimately burdening consumers.

The timing—ahead of the holiday season and U.S. elections—adds urgency. The Federal Reserve's recent rate cut aimed to ease living costs, but a prolonged strike could force a policy rethink.
