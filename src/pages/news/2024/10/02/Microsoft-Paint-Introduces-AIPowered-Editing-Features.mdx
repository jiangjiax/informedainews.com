Microsoft is enhancing Paint with AI tools—Generative Fill and Generative Erase—inspired by Adobe Photoshop. These features allow precise object addition or removal using a brush. Generative Erase clears unwanted elements, akin to Google Pixel's Magic Eraser. Generative Fill adds new content via text descriptions. These updates build on earlier Cocreator tools, improving image quality and speed. The AI model now includes "built-in moderation" to prevent misuse.
