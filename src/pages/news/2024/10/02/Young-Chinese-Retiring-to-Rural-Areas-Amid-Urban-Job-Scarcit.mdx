Young Chinese, frustrated by the scarcity of urban jobs, are returning to the countryside. Gen Z and millennials are documenting their rural "retirement" on social media, often after being laid off or quitting their jobs. Wenzi Dada, a 22-year-old, moved to a bamboo shack in Guizhou, seeking meaning in life beyond the monotony of the city.

China's youth unemployment rate reached 18.8% in August, the highest on record. Chung Chi Nien, chair professor at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, attributes this to economic difficulties and intense job competition. College degrees have "devalued," making it harder for less experienced youth to find work.

Popular retreat destinations include Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan, where living costs are lower. Despite the availability of jobs in delivery, ride-hailing, and manufacturing, young people prefer to wait for better opportunities. Wenzi defends his choice, questioning societal norms that dictate work as a necessity.

Some are turning to e-commerce or social media, leveraging rural settings for content creation. "Youth nursing homes" cater to this trend, offering spaces for reflection and reset. Experts view this as a temporary phenomenon, with long-term goals still centered in cities.

**Key Terms:**
- **Gen Z/Millennials:** Generations born roughly between 1997-2012 (Gen Z) and 1981-1996 (Millennials).
- **E-commerce:** Online buying and selling of goods.
- **Social media influencers:** Individuals who gain popularity by creating content on platforms like Douyin (TikTok).
- **Youth nursing homes:** Facilities marketed for young people to relax and reset, often excluding older guests.
