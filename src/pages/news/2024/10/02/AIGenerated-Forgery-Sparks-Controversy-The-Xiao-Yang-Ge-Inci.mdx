AI-generated forgery technology has once again sparked controversy, stemming from the "Lu Wenqing recording" in the "Xiao Yangge incident" being confirmed as AI-synthesized. This technology, known as Deepfake, uses deep learning to simulate audio and video, capable of synthesizing realistic human voices and facial expressions. The technology itself is neutral, but the risk of abuse is high.

Lin Hongxiang, CEO of Fengping Intelligence, pointed out that AI technology enhances production efficiency, but requires systematic regulation to prevent misuse. Currently, with just a few minutes of material, AI can clone a complete human voice at a low cost. Professional models can more realistically simulate emotions and intonations.

Technically, AI-synthesized audio and video can be identified by adding feature markers, but the popularity is limited due to cost issues. Unscrupulous individuals often use AI for scams, such as the HK$200 million scam in Hong Kong, where AI face-swapping and voice-changing were used for video conference fraud.

AI synthesis technology has matured and is widely used in the film and television industry, such as Andy Lau's digital life in "The Wandering Earth 2." The technology is not inherently wrong; the key lies with the user. Controlling human nature is the way to save AI.
