Francis Ford Coppola’s latest film, *Megalopolis*, starring Adam Driver and Aubrey Plaza, has sparked intense debate since its release. The film, a blend of visual spectacle and unconventional storytelling, was initially controversial due to Coppola’s casting of “cancelled” actors like Jon Voight and Shia LaBeouf. Critics and audiences are polarized, with some praising its ambition and others dismissing it as a failure.

The film’s box office performance has been dismal, earning just $4 million in its opening weekend despite a $140 million budget. Reports suggest it’s playing to near-empty theaters, lagging behind even poorly reviewed foreign films.

Yet, *Megalopolis* has ignited a fervent online discourse. Memorable scenes, such as Adam Driver’s peculiar dialogue delivery, have become viral sensations. The film’s themes—about the future of the U.S., creativity, and Hollywood’s risk aversion—are provoking deep reflection.

Reviews are mixed, with Rotten Tomatoes showing a 49% critic score and a 34% audience score. Some see it as a bold masterpiece, while others view it as a misguided flop. Regardless of opinion, *Megalopolis* is undeniably a topic of intense conversation.

In essence, *Megalopolis* is a cinematic experiment that has divided viewers and critics alike, making it a must-see—or must-avoid—depending on one’s perspective.
