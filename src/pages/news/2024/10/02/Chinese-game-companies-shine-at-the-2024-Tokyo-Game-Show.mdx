The 2024 Tokyo Game Show (TGS) has concluded, with record-breaking numbers in the number of participating companies, exhibition booths, and games showcased. The total number of visitors reached 274,739, a significant increase from the previous year.

Chinese companies reached a peak level of participation at TGS, with over 100 companies exhibiting, nearly 40 of which focused on game development. Established names like Tencent, Papergames, and Xishanju showcased alongside new faces such as Kuaishou and iDreamSky.

Domestic games made notable strides in genres like shooting, anime, and single-player. Titles such as Tencent's "DUNE: Awakening" and "EXOBORNE," Xishanju's "Jiexianji," and Hypergryph's "Arknights: End of Terra" garnered significant attention.

Chinese developers are increasingly prioritizing the PC market, with many products exclusive to PC. In the shooting and anime genres, Chinese companies are demonstrating innovation and strength, leading the global industry.

International recognition of Chinese games is on the rise. Ken Kutaragi, the father of Sony's PlayStation, praised "Black Myth: WuKong" as a "massive impact from China." Overseas companies are also beginning to focus on Chinese themes, such as Koei Tecmo's "Dynasty Warriors: Origin."

China's gaming industry is gradually moving beyond the stereotype of "pay-to-win mobile games," advancing globally with technological prowess and innovation. Domestic companies are not only catching up but also surpassing, becoming formidable competitors on the global gaming stage.
