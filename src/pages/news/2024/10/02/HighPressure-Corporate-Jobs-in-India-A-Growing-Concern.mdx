India's corporate sector faces harsh criticism for its relentless work culture. Employees, especially in formal jobs, endure long hours and high pressure. The average Indian works 47 hours a week, more than in China, Singapore, and Japan.

Anna Sebastian Perayil, a 26-year-old chartered accountant, died after four months at Ernst and Young. Her mother blamed the "overwhelming" work environment. A former employee described a toxic culture, with 12-13 hour days and belittling treatment.

Competition for corporate jobs is fierce. Thousands apply for single positions, making companies resistant to change. Ernst and Young denies the allegations but acknowledges the need for employee well-being.

Other sectors, like IT and media, face similar issues. Narayana Murthy, founder of Infosys, suggested 70-hour workweeks for national growth. Employees report strict monitoring and exploitation.

The relentless demands take a toll on mental health. Some leave for freelance work, seeking relief from toxic office politics. The system remains exploitative, with little incentive for change.
