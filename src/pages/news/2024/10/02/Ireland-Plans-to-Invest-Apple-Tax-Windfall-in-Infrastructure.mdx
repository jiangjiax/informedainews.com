Ireland plans to spend â‚¬13 billion ($14.4 billion) in Apple back taxes on infrastructure. The money comes from a European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruling against Apple's tax affairs in Ireland. Finance Minister Jack Chambers calls it a "transformational" windfall.

Chambers emphasizes the need to invest in housing, energy, water, and transport. He warns against using the funds for daily expenses or narrowing the tax base. The ECJ's decision, final and welcomed by tax justice advocates, forces Apple to pay billions in back taxes.

Ireland's corporate tax rate is one of the lowest in the EU. The country initially fought the ruling, fearing it could deter investment. The ECJ confirmed the European Commission's 2016 decision that Ireland granted Apple unlawful aid.

Ireland's budget surplus, partly due to strong corporate tax receipts, positions it well for these investments. Dublin Chamber CEO Mary Rose Burke supports the focus on "infrastructure essentials," stressing the importance of ringfenced funding for water, wastewater, and electricity grid projects.
