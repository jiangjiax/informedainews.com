DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis envisions a new scientific renaissance driven by AI. His journey from student to entrepreneur, marked by the success of AlphaGo and AlphaFold, underscores AI's transformative potential.

AlphaFold, launched in 2021, predicts protein structures with atomic precision, a breakthrough in biology. Hassabis sees this as a starting point for AI's broader scientific application.

In February 2022, DeepMind partnered with the Swiss Plasma Center to develop a deep reinforcement learning algorithm for plasma control in nuclear fusion. This collaboration aims to optimize plasma configurations in tokamaks, crucial for fusion energy research.

While significant, these achievements are steps toward viable fusion energy. Commercialization remains uncertain, projected between 20-30 years, with scaling challenges.

Hassabis believes AI accelerates scientific discovery, exemplified by AlphaGo's 2016 victory over Go champion Lee Sedol. This triumph shifted DeepMind's focus from games to science, aiming for greater real-world impact.

Hassabis's 25-year journey in AI, inspired by a friend's passion for protein folding, culminated in AlphaFold's success. This tool, using attention networks, mimics human intuition in complex problems like protein folding and Go.

In essence, Hassabis's vision of AI as a creativity multiplier in science is unfolding. His work bridges gaming and biology, leveraging AI's potential to solve intricate scientific challenges.
