Yuewen Group Leads Investment in Card Company Hitcard, Holding 10%. Hitcard Specializes in Adult Collectible Cards and Has Secured Multiple Rounds of Funding, Including from CyberAgent, Akatsuki, and Goodsmile. Hou Xiaonan, CEO of Yuewen, Says the Company Has Made a Significant Step Forward in IP Commercialization, with Card Derivatives Achieving Over 100 Million GMV.

Yuewen Goods and Hitcard Deepen Cooperation, Aiming to Expand IP Commercialization, Increase the Number of Collaborating IPs, and Enrich Card Gameplay. Yuewen Goods Has Already Launched Cards for "Joy of Life" and "The King's Avatar," and Plans to Release Cards for "Under One Person" and "Fights Break Sphere" in Q4.

Pre-sales for "Joy of Life Season 2" Cards Exceed 20 Million, with Over 200,000 Blind Boxes Sold. The Chinese Collectible Card Market Exceeded 10 Billion Yuan in 2022 and is Expected to Reach 30 Billion Yuan Within Three Years. IP Commercialization is a Sign of Maturity, with Many of the World's Most Profitable IPs Relying Heavily on Retail Revenue.

Yuewen Goods Plans to Open Multiple Self-operated Stores in 2024, with Stores Already Open in Xi'an and Hangzhou, and Plans to Open in Beijing and Nanchang in Late October, Focusing on Major Cities and Provincial Capitals.
