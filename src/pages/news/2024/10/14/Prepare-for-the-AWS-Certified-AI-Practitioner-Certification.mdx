The AWS Certified AI Practitioner certification is a key to unlocking higher pay and career growth in AI and ML. This certification is tailored for those familiar with AI/ML on AWS but not necessarily developers. It’s a smart move for anyone looking to stand out in a competitive job market.

A recent AWS study shows that AI expertise can boost salaries by up to 47% in certain fields. This certification proves your grasp of AI and ML, making you a top candidate.

The course on freeCodeCamp.org, developed by Andrew Brown of ExamPro, covers everything you need to pass the exam. It’s a 15-hour deep dive into AI and ML fundamentals, data handling, generative AI, and AWS tools like SageMaker and Bedrock.

This course is ideal for beginners in IT and AWS Cloud, as well as those with existing AWS certifications. If you’re new, start with AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials or AWS Technical Essentials.

The AWS Certified AI Practitioner certification goes beyond the foundational AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification. It focuses specifically on AI frameworks and AWS technologies, especially generative AI.

Whether you’re aiming to upskill or switch careers, this course is a crucial step. Watch the full course on freeCodeCamp.org’s YouTube channel.
