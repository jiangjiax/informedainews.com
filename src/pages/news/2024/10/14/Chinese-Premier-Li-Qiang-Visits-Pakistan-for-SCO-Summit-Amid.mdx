Islamabad, Oct. 14, 2024 — Chinese Premier Li Qiang arrived in Pakistan for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, marking his first visit in 11 years. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif greeted Li at the airport.

Security is tight. Islamabad declared a three-day holiday. Police and paramilitary forces are on high alert. The army secures the Red Zone, home to parliament and embassies.

Recent attacks on Chinese nationals heightened tensions. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar assured enhanced security, emphasizing Sharif’s personal focus.

Former Prime Minister Imran Khan’s planned protest adds to the tension. The government restricts Chinese nationals’ movements, fearing violence from separatists.

The SCO summit, featuring leaders from China, Russia, India, and others, runs Oct. 15-16. Li’s four-day visit includes discussions on the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a $65 billion investment under President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative.

Li will inaugurate the CPEC-funded Gwadar International Airport in Balochistan, bordering Afghanistan and Iran.

**Insights:**

The visit underscores the strategic importance of Pakistan to China. The high security measures reflect the volatile political climate and the threat to Chinese interests. The SCO summit and CPEC discussions highlight regional cooperation and China’s economic ambitions in South Asia.
