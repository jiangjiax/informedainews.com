Uber now allows users to default to fully electric vehicles in over 40 cities. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi announced this at Uber's Go Get Zero conference in London. The move aims to align with global zero-emission goals.

Uber Green, previously a mix of EVs and hybrids, now exclusively offers battery electric vehicles. The company also introduced an AI chatbot to guide drivers interested in switching to EVs.

Transportation accounts for 25% of global carbon emissions. Uber aims to be a zero-emissions platform by 2040.

For drivers, Uber launched an "EV Mentor" program and a partnership with Octopus Energy and BYD to fund 1,000 free home chargers in the U.K. This reduces charging costs and promotes EV adoption.

On the delivery side, Uber Eats adds farmers' market produce in NYC and LA. In Paris, Uber invests in sustainable packaging for restaurants.

France mandates reduced plastic waste, aligning with Uber's sustainability push.

**Insights:**
Uber's shift to EVs and sustainable practices is a significant step. The AI chatbot and EV Mentor program simplify the transition for drivers. Partnerships with energy suppliers and EV manufacturers further this goal.

The move addresses environmental concerns and regulatory pressures. It positions Uber as a leader in sustainable mobility. However, success hinges on broader policy support and infrastructure development.
