ServiceNow and CoreWeave are investing billions into UK data centers to enhance AI capabilities. ServiceNow plans to invest $1.5 billion over five years, expanding its UK footprint and localizing data processing for AI models. They will utilize Nvidia GPUs in London and Newport to support "domain-specific LLMs" for UK clients.

CoreWeave, a cloud computing company, is investing £750 million to meet UK AI infrastructure needs. This follows their earlier £1 billion commitment. Two other US firms, CyrusOne and CloudHQ, are also making significant investments: £2.5 billion and £1.9 billion, respectively.

These investments total £6.3 billion, reflecting strong confidence in the UK’s tech strategy. UK Technology Minister Peter Kyle welcomed the move as a boost for sustained growth.

ServiceNow aims to upskill 240,000 people in the UK. CEO Bill McDermott views the UK as a global leader in AI innovation, driving benefits for all communities.

Salesforce has also joined the trend, opening its first global AI center in London and committing $4 billion over five years.

**Key Terms:**

- **AI Sovereignty:** The idea that AI technologies and data should be stored within Europe, reflecting local culture and history.
- **GPUs (Graphics Processing Units):** Powerful processors used to handle complex calculations, crucial for AI training and processing.
