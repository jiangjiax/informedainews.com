On October 14, 1872, Japan's first railway, connecting Tokyo and Yokohama, commenced. The inaugural train carried Emperor Meiji from Shimbashi to Yokohama. This railway was a pivotal symbol of modernization.

British explorer Isabella Bird, who traveled Japan in 1878, described the railway's amenities: hourly service, tiered waiting rooms, luggage handling, and European-style carriages. First and second-class cars were luxurious but sparsely used; third-class was crowded.

The original Shimbashi station is now Shiodome, and Yokohama's terminal was Sakuragicho. Railways spurred economic growth and territorial expansion.

By 1900, railways were integral to Japanese life. The song "Tetsud≈ç Uta" celebrated this, starting with "A whistle echoes through Shimbashi." In 1995, Japan designated October 14 as "Railway Day."

In 2022, Japan commemorated the 150th anniversary with special trains and exhibitions. The National Archives showcased historical documents, including an 1882 timetable detailing fares, rules, and smoking cars.

Today, digital "transfer guides" like Yahoo! Japan and Jordan offer real-time train info. Jordan even simulated the 1872 railway experience digitally.

Railways transformed Japan, linking its past and present.
