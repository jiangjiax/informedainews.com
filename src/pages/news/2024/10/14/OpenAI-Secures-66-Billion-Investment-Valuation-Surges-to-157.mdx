OpenAI has secured a $66 billion (approximately ¥463 billion) investment, boosting its valuation to $1570 billion (approximately ¥11 trillion). This marks the company's largest venture capital deal to date. The funding round was led by Thrive Capital, with Microsoft, NVIDIA, and SoftBank also participating. Notably, Apple did not join this round.

The investment is structured as convertible debt, meaning it will convert to equity if OpenAI transitions to a for-profit entity within two years. If not, OpenAI must repay the debt. This move aims to enhance OpenAI's leadership in AI research, boost computational power, and develop AI tools to solve complex problems.

OpenAI predicts its revenue will surge from $37 billion this year to $116 billion next year, then double again to $256 billion by 2025, and reach $1000 billion by 2029.

The deal also includes a unique clause for Thrive Capital: if OpenAI meets revenue targets, Thrive can invest an additional $10 billion at a $1500 billion valuation next year. This could yield significant returns for Thrive.

OpenAI's transition to a for-profit entity faces substantial legal hurdles, requiring complex asset redistribution. The company must compensate its original non-profit structure, which could be challenging given the rapid growth since ChatGPT's launch.

This funding propels OpenAI into a new era, attracting more investors. However, the company must address core issues like leadership changes, safety concerns, and revenue generation to satisfy its new stakeholders.
