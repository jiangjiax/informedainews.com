Google's Audio Overview, powered by NotebookLM and Gemini 1.5, creates AI podcasts. Users upload PDFs and videos, then ask questions for summaries. The tool generates a podcast, "Deep Dive," with realistic voices discussing the content.

Originally a study tool, NotebookLM now offers customizable options: length, format, voices, and languages. Some users create podcasts in languages other than English. Examples include summaries of "The Great Gatsby," Meta's Llama-3 code, and OpenAI's Dev Day announcements.

The tool can produce humorous results, like an AI discussion on "poop" and "fart."

**Explanation:**
- **NotebookLM:** A tool that helps summarize and discuss uploaded content.
- **Gemini 1.5:** A technology that powers NotebookLM, enabling it to create realistic AI voices.
- **Llama-3 code:** Likely refers to a code or project by Meta, possibly related to AI or machine learning.
