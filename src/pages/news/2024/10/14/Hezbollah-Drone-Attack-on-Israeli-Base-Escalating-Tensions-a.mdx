Hezbollah drones struck an Israeli army base near Binyamina, killing four soldiers and severely wounding seven others. The attack, claimed as retaliation for Israeli strikes on Beirut, marked Hezbollah's deadliest since Israel's invasion of Lebanon. The assault involved dozens of missiles and "squadrons" of drones, some of which were used for the first time, targeting Israel's elite Golani brigade.

Israel's national rescue service reported 61 wounded, a rare occurrence given the country's advanced air-defence systems. Tensions have escalated since the Gaza war began a year ago.

In response, the U.S. plans to deploy a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile system to Israel, along with about 100 troops. THAAD is a sophisticated missile defence system with six truck-mounted launchers, each carrying eight interceptors, and a powerful radar.

Iran's foreign minister warned that U.S. troops could be at risk. Hezbollah threatened more attacks if Israel's offensive in Lebanon continues.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned attacks on peacekeepers in Lebanon. Israel's prime minister called for UNIFIL troops to evacuate Hezbollah strongholds.

In Gaza, an Israeli airstrike killed at least 20, including children, at a school sheltering displaced Palestinians.
