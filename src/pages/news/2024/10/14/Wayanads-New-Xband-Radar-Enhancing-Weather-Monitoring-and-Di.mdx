In July 2024, Wayanad, Kerala, faced devastating floods and landslides, claiming over 200 lives. The Union Ministry of Earth Sciences responded by approving an X-band radar for the district. This radar, crucial for monitoring weather and predicting natural disasters, operates by emitting radio waves to gauge the distance, velocity, and characteristics of objects like clouds.

**Doppler Radar**: Uses the Doppler effect to measure cloud movement and speed. It emits pulses to gauge rainfall intensity, aiding in storm and wind pattern prediction.

**X-band Radar**: Emits radiation in the 8-12 GHz range, ideal for detecting small particles like rain droplets. It offers high-resolution images but has a shorter range. In Wayanad, it will monitor soil movements, crucial for landslide warnings.

India's radar history began in the 1950s with the IMD. The first indigenous X-band radar was installed in Delhi in 1970. By 2024, India plans to add 56 Doppler radars, part of the â‚¹2,000-crore 'Mission Mausam'. This initiative includes 10 X-band radars for the northeast and Himachal Pradesh.

**NISAR**: A joint NASA-ISRO satellite project, set for launch in 2025. It will use L-band and S-band radars to map Earth's landmasses, tracking natural processes.

The deployment of advanced radars underscores India's commitment to enhancing weather forecasting and disaster preparedness.
