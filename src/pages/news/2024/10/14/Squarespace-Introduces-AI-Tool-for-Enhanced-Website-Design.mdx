Squarespace's Design Intelligence uses AI to craft websites, focusing on quality over quantity. It generates design elements and text based on prompts, but allows for extensive human customization. This balance ensures a professional, unique look.

**Key Points:**
- **Curation:** Squarespace curates content to match their design ethos, ensuring high quality.
- **AI Integration:** Unlike others, Squarespace thoughtfully integrates AI, enhancing human creativity rather than replacing it.
- **Opportunity for Designers:** AI speeds up creation, freeing time for personal touches.

**Insights:**
AI should be seen as a tool to amplify human creativity, not diminish it. Squarespace's approach exemplifies this balance.
