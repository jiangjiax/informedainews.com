Liquid AI, a MIT spinoff based in Boston, has unveiled LFMs (Liquid Foundation Models). These AI models are designed to handle continuous dataâ€”think streaming information, not static datasets. The technology aims to make AI more adaptable and responsive in real-time scenarios.

**Insight:**
LFMs represent a shift towards more fluid, dynamic AI systems. By processing continuous data, they could revolutionize applications from autonomous vehicles to financial trading, where quick, adaptive responses are crucial.
