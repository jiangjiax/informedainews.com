Nasa's Europa Clipper is set to launch on October 14, 2024, from Kennedy Space Center. The mission aims to explore Jupiter's moon Europa, where a vast ocean lies beneath its icy surface. This ocean could harbor life.

The spacecraft, weighing six tons, will travel nearly 2 billion miles over six years to reach Europa. It will carry nine instruments, including cameras and radar, to study the moon's surface and subsurface.

Europa Clipper will not directly search for life but will look for signs of habitability, such as organic compounds and gases. The mission seeks to determine if Europa is habitable now, not just in the past.

The spacecraft faces significant challenges, including extreme radiation from Jupiter's magnetic field. To protect its electronics, Europa Clipper will orbit Jupiter and conduct 49 flybys of Europa, each exposing it to radiation equivalent to 1 million chest X-rays.

Despite these risks, the mission is crucial. Europa's ocean holds twice as much water as Earth's, making it a prime candidate for extraterrestrial life. The UK Space Agency has also invested in a related mission, ESA's Juice probe, set to arrive at Jupiter in 2031.

Together, these missions could provide definitive proof of habitable worlds beyond Earth within the next decade.
