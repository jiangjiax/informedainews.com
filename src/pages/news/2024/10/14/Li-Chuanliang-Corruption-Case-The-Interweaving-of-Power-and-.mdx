Li Chuanliang, the former deputy mayor of Jixi City, is involved in a corruption case and has absconded overseas.

During his tenure, he embezzled and defrauded public property worth nearly 3 billion yuan, accepted bribes totaling nearly 50 million yuan, and misappropriated public funds amounting to 110 million yuan.

He owns 18 companies spanning multiple sectors including energy and real estate, with actual control over their equity.

After the case was exposed, assets worth 1.4 billion yuan were seized, including 1,021 properties, 27 plots of land and tidal flats, 8 forest plots, 38 vehicles, and 10 pieces of machinery and equipment.

In 2014, he transferred 5 million yuan in illicit funds to Hong Kong, involving Sun Chengxiang, the general manager of Jixi Binhang Special Automobile Co., Ltd., and Dong Yujun, a cadre from the Jixi Finance Bureau.
