As Halloween approaches, "GTA Online" introduces the "Halloween Nightmare" event. Players must photograph UFOs, participate in survival battles in North Yankton, and combat the undead. Successfully completing challenges rewards players with GTA dollars, RP, and unique prizes. A community challenge requires the elimination of 80 million zombies to win special outfits. Additionally, the "Ghost Exposures" event returns, offering double rewards for photographing ghosts. Halloween-themed missions provide triple rewards.

**Notes:**
- **GTA dollars**: In-game currency.
- **RP**: Reputation Points, the experience points required for character level advancement.
