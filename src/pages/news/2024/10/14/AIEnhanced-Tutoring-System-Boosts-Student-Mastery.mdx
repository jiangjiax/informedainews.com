Tutor CoPilot, a Human-AI system, boosts student mastery by 4 percentage points. It assists novice tutors with expert guidance, particularly benefiting lower-rated tutors by 9 percentage points. The system costs just $20 per tutor annually. Tutors adopt better teaching strategies, such as asking guiding questions instead of providing answers. Some issues, like grade-level appropriateness, require refinement. Overall, it demonstrates how AI can scale expertise and enhance education for all students.
