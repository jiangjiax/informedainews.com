In Virginia, a swarm of unidentified drones hovered over a military base for 17 days. The area included the home of SEAL Team Six and Naval Station Norfolk, the world's largest naval port. This occurred just months after the U.S. shot down a Chinese spy balloon.

The drones, some 20 feet long and flying at over 100 mph, baffled officials. Meetings were held with experts from the Defense Department, FBI, and Pentagon's UFO office. Federal law prevents the military from shooting down drones unless they pose an imminent threat.

Two months earlier, five drones flew over a Nevada site used for nuclear-weapons experiments. The operators remain unknown.

The Virginia drones appeared at dusk, vanished each night, and were nearly impossible to track. Langley Air Force Base canceled nighttime training and moved F-22 jets.

In January, a University of Minnesota student, Fengyun Shi, was arrested. His drone, stuck in a tree, had photographed Navy vessels. Shi claimed to be a ship enthusiast and unaware of restricted airspace. He was sentenced to six months in prison.

Despite Shi's arrest, the mystery of the Virginia drones remains unsolved. More unidentified drone swarms have been spotted near Edwards Air Force Base.
