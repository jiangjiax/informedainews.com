The 2024 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to American scientists Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun for their discovery of microRNAs and their role in gene regulation.

Within cells, chromosomes store the "instruction manuals" for all cells. Despite each cell having the same genome, different cell types perform distinct functions. This diversity arises from gene regulation, ensuring that each cell type activates only the relevant genes.

Ambros and Ruvkun discovered microRNAs, a new class of RNA molecules, which play a crucial role in gene regulation. Their findings unveiled a new principle of gene regulation, essential for multicellular organisms.

Ambros first identified lin-4, a small non-protein-coding RNA molecule, in the worm. Ruvkun then discovered let-7, further confirming the universality of microRNAs.

These discoveries have transformed our understanding of gene regulation, particularly in diseases such as cancer. While there are currently no direct medical applications, the potential for future advancements is immense.

The Nobel Prize underscores the importance of curiosity-driven research. Ambros and Ruvkun's findings exemplify the profound impact of basic scientific research.
