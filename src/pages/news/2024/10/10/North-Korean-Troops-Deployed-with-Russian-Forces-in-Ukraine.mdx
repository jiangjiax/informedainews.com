North Korean military engineers are aiding Russia in Ukraine, targeting the country with ballistic missiles. Dozens of North Koreans are reportedly operating behind Russian lines, supporting KN-23 missile systems. These deployments follow a secret arms deal between Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin during their summit in Russia last year.

North Korean ammunition has been crucial for Russia's war efforts, providing over 2 million rounds and KN-23 missiles. These missiles, similar to Russia's Iskander-M, have a range of about 280 miles. Despite their poor quality, they have kept Russian forces supplied and active.

Reports indicate that some North Koreans have been killed in recent Ukrainian strikes. South Korean officials confirm the likelihood of North Korean officers fighting alongside Russians, suggesting a deeper military involvement than previously known.

For North Korea, this deployment offers a chance to test weapons and gain combat experience. It also strengthens ties with Russia, potentially securing support for Pyongyang's spy satellite program. Both nations deny the troop deployment and weapons sales, yet their public celebrations of deepening ties suggest a covert alliance.

This move by North Korea underscores its strategic pivot towards Russia and China, aiming to counter "western hegemony and imperialism." The deployment marks a significant escalation in foreign military involvement in Ukraine, with potential long-term implications for regional stability.
