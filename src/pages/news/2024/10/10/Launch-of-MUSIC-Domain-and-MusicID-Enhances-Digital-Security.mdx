The .MUSIC domain and MusicID have officially launched, offering a secure digital space for the global music community. This new top-level domain (TLD) and verified identity system aim to protect artists, creators, and industry professionals from unauthorized use of their intellectual property, including AI-generated deepfakes and voice cloning.

Registration is limited to authenticated members of the music community, ensuring a trusted environment. Constantine Roussos, founder and CEO of .MUSIC, emphasizes that this marks the first time the industry can uniquely identify and protect its digital presence.

Marina Rusu, executive director of id.music, highlights the importance of safeguarding digital identities and creative works from fraud and AI abuse. The .MUSIC domain is exclusively for certified music professionals, enhancing trust and authenticity in online interactions.

**Key Terms:**
- **Top-Level Domain (TLD):** The last segment of a domain name, like ".com" or ".music."
- **MusicID:** A verified digital identity system for music professionals.
- **AI Deepfakes:** AI-generated content that mimics real people or sounds, often without consent.

This initiative is supported by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), reflecting a broader industry commitment to digital integrity.
