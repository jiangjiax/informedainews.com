Disease detection, especially nucleic acid testing, has long been a challenge in areas with limited medical resources. Traditional testing equipment is expensive and complex, affordable only by large hospitals. The slow results delay treatment and may spread infectious diseases.

Chen Chong's team aims to change this situation. They have developed a new type of nucleic acid detector that is low-cost and easy to operate. This device is like a master in martial arts novelsâ€”without the Excalibur, but with profound internal strength.

The key lies in the optimization of "enzymes." Traditional testing requires sample purification, but the new instrument skips this step and detects directly. Isothermal amplification technology also simplifies the process and reduces costs.

The team also introduced "fluorescent probes" to enhance detection sensitivity. Ultimately, they created a detector the size of a can of cola, costing less than 1% of traditional equipment. It is simple to operate, delivers results in 30 minutes, and maintains accuracy.

This innovation is significant. It allows timely testing in remote areas, preventing disease spread. The technology is integrated into a compact device, truly transforming the medical landscape.
