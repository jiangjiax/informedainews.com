Amazon is testing a new strategy to draw more shoppers to Whole Foods. They're adding mini warehouses, called micro fulfillment centers, to some Whole Foods stores. One is being built in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania, and should be up and running within a year.

These centers will allow shoppers to order items from Amazon's website and Amazon Fresh while they're at Whole Foods. They can pick up their orders at checkout. The centers use robots to fetch and pack items like socks, soda, and tennis rackets.

This move aims to reduce the need for customers to visit multiple stores. The average American shops at two different grocery stores weekly. Amazon wants to eliminate those extra trips.

Whole Foods customers often seek natural and organic products. But many also visit other stores to complete their shopping. Amazon's micro fulfillment centers could reduce this need.

Amazon has been expanding into the grocery market for years. They bought Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion. They've also launched grocery delivery services and Amazon Fresh supermarkets.

The goal is to capture a larger share of the grocery market, where Americans spend more than on clothes or electronics. But Amazon faces stiff competition from Walmart, Kroger, and others.

This new approach could make Whole Foods more appealing by offering a wider range of products under one roof.
