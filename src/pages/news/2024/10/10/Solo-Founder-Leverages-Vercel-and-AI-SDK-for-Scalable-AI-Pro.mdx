Claire Vo, a solo founder, built ChatPRD, an AI co-pilot for product managers, which scaled to 20,000 users in nine months. ChatPRD helps PMs write documents, brainstorm roadmaps, and boost efficiency.

**Challenges:**
As a solo founder, Claire faced hurdles in integrating advanced AI without technical overload. She needed a solution to focus on core product features.

**Solution:**
Vercel, a deployment platform, and its AI SDK became the backbone. Vercel handled infrastructure, allowing Claire to concentrate on product development. The AI SDK simplified implementing AI features like streaming responses and UI components, crucial for reducing latency and enhancing user experience.

**Impact:**
The AI SDK's streaming feature notably improved user satisfaction and sign-ups. Claire noted that perceived low latency was a game-changer, significantly impacting business growth.

**Next Steps:**
ChatPRD aims to expand features for team collaboration. Vercel and its AI SDK continue to support rapid, efficient development, crucial for solo founders and small teams.

**Insight:**
Tools like Vercel and its AI SDK empower solo founders to focus on innovation, bypassing technical complexities. This allows for faster, more impactful product development and user engagement.
