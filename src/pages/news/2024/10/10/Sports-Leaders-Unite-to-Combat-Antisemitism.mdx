Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, has launched a campaign titled "Time Out Against Hate" to combat antisemitism. Joined by major sports leagues and icons like Billie Jean King and Shaquille O'Neal, the initiative aims to raise awareness through an ad set to premiere during Amazon's Thursday Night Football. Kraft's Foundation to Combat Antisemitism, founded in 2019, seeks to address rising hate against Jews in the U.S. Kraft has also taken personal stands, including withdrawing financial support from Columbia University over its handling of anti-Israel protests and donating $1 million to Yeshiva University to cover tuition for Jewish students.
