Image Splitter is a straightforward online tool for dividing images into smaller parts. No downloads neededâ€”just upload, set rows and columns, and split. Perfect for design, education, or personal use.

**Insight:** This tool streamlines image division, making it easy for anyone to segment images quickly without complex software.

**Explanation:**
- **Rows and Columns:** Think of an image as a grid. Rows are horizontal lines, columns are vertical lines. Setting these divides the image into smaller, grid-like sections.
