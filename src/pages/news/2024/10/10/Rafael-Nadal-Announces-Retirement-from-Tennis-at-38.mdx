Rafael Nadal, 38, announces his retirement from tennis. A legend with 22 grand slam titles, he dominated Roland Garros with 14 wins. Nadal’s career, marked by a revolutionary topspin forehand and relentless athleticism, transformed the game.

His rivalry with Federer and later Djokovic defined the golden era of men’s tennis. Nadal’s physicality pushed the sport’s limits, but chronic injuries, notably Müller-Weiss Syndrome, often sidelined him. Despite this, he achieved remarkable longevity, winning his last grand slam titles in 2022.

Recent years saw his health decline. After a 2020 foot injury relapse and 2022 hip surgery, Nadal struggled to stay fit. His final seasons were marred by early exits and injuries, culminating in a thigh injury before the Olympics.

Nadal’s last competitive matches will be at the Davis Cup Finals in Malaga. His career, one of the greatest in tennis history, ends with gratitude and respect from fans worldwide.
