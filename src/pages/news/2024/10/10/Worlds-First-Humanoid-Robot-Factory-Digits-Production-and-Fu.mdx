Agility Robotics' "RoboFab" in Oregon is the world's first humanoid robot factory. Digit, their bipedal robot, is being produced here at a rate of 10,000 units annually. Digit is designed to handle repetitive tasks in logistics, addressing labor shortages. The next generation will include collaborative safety features, more AI integration, and self-recharging capabilities. The ultimate goal: robots building themselves.
