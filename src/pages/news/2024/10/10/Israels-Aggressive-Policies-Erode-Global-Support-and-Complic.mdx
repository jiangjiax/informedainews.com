Israel’s relentless collective punishment of Gaza, the West Bank, and Lebanon has backfired. The Dahiyeh doctrine, advocating disproportionate retaliation, has only deepened animosity. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant’s callous remarks—“We are fighting human animals”—exacerbate the crisis.

Hamas, facing a popularity slump, launched Operation Al-Aqsa Flood to rebrand itself as a defender of Palestinians. The strategy worked; support for armed resistance surged among Palestinians. Similarly, Hezbollah’s support in Lebanon grew, despite Israeli aggression.

Israel’s actions have unraveled decades of diplomatic efforts. Saudi Arabia now demands Palestinian self-determination before any normalization. The Abraham Accords, championed by Trump, are weakened, with Sudan’s leadership facing backlash.

Globally, Israel faces increasing isolation. Colombia severed ties, and France, a long-time ally, called for an arms embargo. These shifts reflect growing international condemnation of Israel’s tactics.

The U.S., Israel’s chief benefactor, is also under scrutiny. The double standard of excusing Israel’s actions while harshly criticizing others undermines U.S. credibility. Israel’s aggressive policies are not just harming its image; they’re eroding global support and complicating U.S. foreign policy.
