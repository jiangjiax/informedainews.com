China retaliates against the EU with brandy tariffs. The EU imposed anti-subsidy tariffs on Chinese electric cars. China's Ministry of Commerce responds with deposits up to 39% on European brandy imports. These deposits could become permanent tariffs.

The EU challenges China's measures at the World Trade Organization (WTO). EU officials deny dumping accusations, noting brandy prices are higher in China. Spirits Europe calls for negotiations.

China considers tariffs on European pork, dairy, and large engine cars. This could impact Spain, Netherlands, Ireland, and Germany. France, leading in electric car tariffs, is also a major brandy exporter.

Trade tensions rise between Europe and China. EU concerns include China's support for Russia and trade deficits. Some EU countries opposed electric car tariffs, fearing retaliation.

A senior European diplomat expects limited trade war. China's economy and US market concerns may temper aggressive actions. Targeting specific sectors like brandy seems a calculated move.

Both sides seek agreements to address trade imbalances. China also challenges Turkey's 40% tariffs on electric cars at the WTO. Turkey offers exemptions for companies setting up factories.
