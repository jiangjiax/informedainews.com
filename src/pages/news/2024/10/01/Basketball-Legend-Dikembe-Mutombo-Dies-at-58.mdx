Dikembe Mutombo, 58, passed away from brain cancer. A towering 7ft 2in, he was a basketball legend—second all-time in blocked shots, an eight-time All-Star, and four-time defensive player of the year. His No. 55 jersey was retired by the Atlanta Hawks and Denver Nuggets.

Off the court, Mutombo was a humanitarian. His foundation improved health in the Democratic Republic of Congo. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver called him the league’s first Global Ambassador, praising his impact on communities.

Mutombo’s playful finger wag after blocks became iconic. He spoke seven languages and served on boards like Special Olympics International and the CDC Foundation.

His family revealed his cancer treatment two years ago. Mutombo left behind his wife, Rose, and seven children, including a son, Ryan, who follows in his father’s footsteps at Georgetown.
