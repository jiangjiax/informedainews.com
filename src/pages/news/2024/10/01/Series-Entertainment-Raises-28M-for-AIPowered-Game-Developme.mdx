Pany Haritatos, a seasoned gaming industry executive, has secured $28 million in Series A funding for his startup, Series Entertainment. The round includes investments from Netflix, Dell Technologies Capital, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), BITKRAFT, and F4 Fund. This follows a $7.9 million seed round led by a16z a year ago.

Series, also known as Series AI, aims to transform game development through the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI. The company’s Rho Engine utilizes AI to accelerate game creation, positioning Series as a potential competitor to Unity.

Haritatos’ background includes founding and selling multiple game studios, including Kongregate and Snap’s games group. His experience and vision have attracted high-profile investors, such as BITKRAFT’s Jens Hilgers and F4 Fund’s David Kaye and Joakim Achrén.

Series has grown from 17 to over 100 employees, attracting talent from Zynga, Machine Zone, Google, and Snap. The company declined to comment on its $190 million post-money valuation, estimated by Pitchbook.
