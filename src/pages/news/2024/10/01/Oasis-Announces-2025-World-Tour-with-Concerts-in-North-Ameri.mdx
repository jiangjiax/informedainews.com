Oasis, the band of the Gallagher brothers, is back. Their 2025 tour will hit the US, Canada, and Mexico. After teasing fans with billboards, they've confirmed the dates: Toronto on August 24, Chicago on August 28, New Jersey on August 31, Los Angeles on September 6, and Mexico City on September 12. Cage the Elephant will be the opening act.

This tour marks their first in these regions since 2008. Their 1994-95 American debut was chaotic, with Noel Gallagher briefly quitting after a drunken show in LA.

The band's already sold-out UK and Ireland dates have added five more shows due to high demand. Initial ticket sales were marred by technical issues and high prices, leading to two new Wembley Stadium shows via a ballot.

Dynamic pricing, where ticket prices fluctuate based on demand, caused uproar. Oasis claimed ignorance, blaming promoters. The government plans to review this practice. Consumer groups want refunds for overcharged fans.

Ticketmaster defends dynamic pricing, saying it deters scalpers. Liam Gallagher dismissed critics, telling one to "shut up" and another to buy "kneeling tickets."

**Dynamic pricing**: A method where ticket prices change based on demand, often leading to higher prices as demand increases.
