Researchers have identified a potential "pause button" in human embryonic development. This mechanism, similar to the dormant state observed in some animals, could delay embryo growth. The study, published in *Cell*, utilized human stem cells and embryoid models to investigate the mTOR signaling pathway. Inhibiting mTOR triggered a dormant state, marked by slowed cell division and reduced attachment to the uterine wall.

This dormant state is reversible and seems to be confined to early embryonic stages. The researchers propose that humans may retain an evolutionary remnant of this ability, even if it is not naturally employed during pregnancy.

The findings could influence reproductive technologies such as IVF. Accelerating embryo development through mTOR activation might enhance IVF success rates, while inducing dormancy could offer more time to evaluate embryo health and improve implantation.

In essence, this research reveals a previously unrecognized facet of human development, potentially paving the way for advancements in reproductive health.
