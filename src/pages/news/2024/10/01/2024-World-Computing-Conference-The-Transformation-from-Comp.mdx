The 2024 World Computing Conference was held in Changsha, with the theme shifting from "Computing Everything" to "Intelligent Computing Everything." This one-word change reveals a disruptive transformation in computing technology.

The conference focused on green and intelligent computing, showcasing an immersion liquid-cooled computer. This computer uses electronic fluorinated liquid for cooling, reducing energy consumption by 30%. Piero Scaruffi, President of the Silicon Valley Artificial Intelligence Institute, proposed that building smaller models is an effective approach to addressing the power consumption issues of large models.

China ranks second globally in total computing power but faces challenges such as insufficient and uneven computing power. ZTE proposed a solution of "strengthening computing through networks, open decoupling, and elevating intelligence," to promote the networking of computing resources. Sugon introduced the concept of "three-dimensional computing," with a 5A-level intelligent computing center as a model, deeply practiced in Changsha.

Computing power has permeated various fields such as personal life, government management, and industrial development. Unitree's humanoid robots and robotic dogs showcased the charm of artificial intelligence. Topway Information's smart tunnel sandbox demonstrated the application of computing power in the transportation sector. Wondershare's audio-visual multimedia large model, Wondershare "Tianmu," showcased the application of computing power in the integration of culture and technology.

Pan Yunhe, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, pointed out that artificial intelligence technology will drive a high-level upgrade of China's industries, making a greater contribution to the global economy. Every RMB 1 invested in computing power will drive GDP growth of RMB 3 to 4.

**Key Term Explanations:**
- **Intelligent Computing Everything**: Refers to the intelligent processing and application of everything through intelligent computing technology.
- **Immersion Liquid-Cooled Computer**: A computer that cools key components by fully immersing them in special liquid, resulting in lower energy consumption.
- **Computing Power**: Refers to computational capability, a new form of productive force in the digital economy era.
- **Three-Dimensional Computing**: Refers to a multi-dimensional layout and vertical-horizontal expansion that comprehensively addresses the construction, application, and ecosystem of computing resources.
