Google plans to invest $1 billion in Thailand, establishing a data center and cloud region. This move aims to meet escalating cloud demand and bolster AI adoption in Southeast Asia. The project, expected to create 14,000 jobs annually until 2029, aligns with Thailand's Cloud First Policy. The data center will be in Chonburi, with the cloud region in Bangkok. This follows Microsoft's similar initiative in May.
