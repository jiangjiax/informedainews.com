The far-right Freedom party (FPÖ) won Austria’s parliamentary elections, securing 29.1% of the vote. This marks the first time since World War II that a far-right party has led in Austria. The FPÖ, known for its hardline stance on immigration and anti-EU rhetoric, capitalized on public discontent over migration, inflation, and economic stagnation.

The ruling centre-right People’s party (ÖVP) came in second with 26.2%, while the Social Democratic party had its worst performance at 20.4%. The Greens, despite the recent climate crisis, garnered only 8.6%.

FPÖ’s success reflects a broader rightward shift in Europe, modeled after Hungary’s Viktor Orbán. The party’s leader, Herbert Kickl, a former interior minister, campaigned on deporting “undesirable” immigrants and opposing EU sanctions against Russia.

The ÖVP, though defeated, remains a potential coalition partner for the FPÖ. However, Chancellor Karl Nehammer has ruled out Kickl as a chancellor candidate, setting the stage for complex negotiations.

This election underscores Austria’s shifting political landscape and the growing influence of far-right ideologies in Europe.
