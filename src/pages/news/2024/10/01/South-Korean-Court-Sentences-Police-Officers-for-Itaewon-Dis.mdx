A South Korean court sentenced three police officers to prison for their role in the 2022 Itaewon crowd crush, which killed 159 people. The officers, including the former chief of Seoulâ€™s Yongsan police station, were convicted of professional negligence resulting in death. The court found their inadequate preparation and response exacerbated the disaster.

The crush occurred during Halloween celebrations in Itaewon, a popular nightlife district. The court ruled it was preventable, criticizing the officers for failing to alert others of the danger and supervise effectively. The police officers and prosecutors can appeal the verdict.

In contrast, the court acquitted the head of the Yongsan ward office and three other officials, stating they lacked legal authority to control the crowd. Bereaved families criticized this decision, questioning its logic.

A 2023 special investigation revealed police and municipal officials had anticipated large crowds but failed to implement effective control measures. The investigation also noted police ignored warnings from pedestrians about the swelling crowd before the fatal surge.

This case highlights the critical need for effective crowd management and the accountability of authorities in preventing such tragedies.
