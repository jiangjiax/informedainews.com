The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) warns over 40 airlines using Boeing 737s with potentially faulty rudder parts. A February incident involving a United flight highlighted the issue. The NTSB fears other airlines might be unaware of these risks. Boeing shares dropped 2.7%. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) plans additional testing in October. United removed the parts from its planes earlier this year.
