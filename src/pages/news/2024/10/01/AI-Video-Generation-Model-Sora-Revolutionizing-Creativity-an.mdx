The launch of the AI video generation model Sora marks a significant leap in artificial intelligence's capabilities in the creative field. Elon Musk's comment "gg humans" suggests that AI may surpass humans in certain areas. Sora makes video creation simple and efficient, allowing for the generation of realistic videos with just a single sentence, eliminating the need for editing. This lowers the barrier to entry for creation, enhances efficiency, but may also lead to content homogenization.

The iteration speed of AI is astonishing, capable of inspiring more creativity, but it also demands creators to possess higher comprehensive abilities, such as screenwriting and directing. Prompts have become the core of creation, requiring precise descriptions, which raises the threshold for creation. Complex prompts may hinder AI's widespread adoption, as current daily active users of AI applications are far fewer than those of short video platforms.

AI may also exacerbate the issue of falsification, casting doubt on the authenticity of video content. However, AI also provides new opportunities for creators to make money, as knowledge-based bloggers promote the popularization of technology by disseminating AI knowledge.

In summary, AI is transforming the creative ecosystem while bringing new challenges and opportunities. Creators need to continuously enhance their abilities to adapt to the changes brought by the AI era.
