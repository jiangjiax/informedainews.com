Russia and China now settle 95% of their trade in rubles and yuan, bypassing third-country currencies. Despite a slight dip in trade in March-April, bilateral trade surged 26.3% to $240.11 billion in 2023. This milestone exceeds the 2024 target of $200 billion set by leaders Putin and Xi in 2018. The two nations celebrate 75 years of diplomatic ties this October, with the Soviet Union being the first to recognize China in 1949.
