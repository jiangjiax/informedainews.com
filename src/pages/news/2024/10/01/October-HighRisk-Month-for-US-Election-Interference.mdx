October is crunchtime for U.S. elections, a month ripe for foreign mischief. Federal officials warn of heightened risks, with time to react running short.

Russia openly backs Trump, while Iran, Moscow’s ally in Ukraine, hacks Trump’s campaign to thwart his return. The Justice Department is set to indict an Iranian hacking group linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

China, uncertain about its stance, focuses on local races to undermine public faith in the democratic process.

Intelligence briefings reveal a complex battlefield. Russia remains the most active threat, but Iran’s counter-efforts and China’s muddled position add new dimensions.

Election officials fear cyberattacks could lock up registration systems, skewing results or giving pro-Trump officials an excuse not to certify votes.

The U.S. government is more proactive this year, warning the public of potential threats to bolster election security.

Jen Easterly, head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, emphasizes the common goal of foreign adversaries: undermining American confidence in election security and sowing partisan discord.
