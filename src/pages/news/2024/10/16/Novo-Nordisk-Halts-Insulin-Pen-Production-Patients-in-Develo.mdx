Novo Nordisk, a pharmaceutical giant, has halted production of insulin pens, forcing type 1 diabetes patients in developing countries to revert to using glass vials and syringes. These patients argue that this shift is inconvenient and less accurate. Novo Nordisk claims the move is due to "capacity constraints," but critics suggest it prioritizes the production of weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, which are more profitable.

Lecritia Roberts, a South African with type 1 diabetes, recalls the difficulties of using vials as a teenager. She emphasizes the convenience and discreetness of insulin pens, which are now being taken away. A survey by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and T1International found that 82% of patients prefer pens over syringes and vials.

Novo Nordisk will continue producing pens for more expensive, synthetic insulin, which is out of reach for many in developing countries. Candice Sehoma, from MSF, criticizes the company for creating unequal care globally. Novo Nordisk denies the move is profit-driven, but the timing coincides with a $4 billion investment in a US plant to boost production of weight-loss drugs.

The original insulin patent was assigned to the University of Toronto to ensure accessibility. Today, three companies control over 90% of insulin production, including the new weight-loss drugs. MSF calls for lower prices on all insulin devices, suggesting they could still be profitable at $1 per pen.
