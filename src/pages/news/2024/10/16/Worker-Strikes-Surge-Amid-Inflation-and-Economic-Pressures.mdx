Inflation and rising costs are fueling strikes across America. Boeing is facing a month-long strike by 33,000 workers demanding better wages and pensions. A dockworkers' strike has threatened trade on the East and Gulf Coasts. The American Postal Workers Union has rallied for safer conditions and fairer pay. These actions reflect a growing resolve among workers, inspired by past successes. Despite claims to the contrary, companies have the resources to meet these demands. The economy and upcoming elections are amplifying these tensions.
