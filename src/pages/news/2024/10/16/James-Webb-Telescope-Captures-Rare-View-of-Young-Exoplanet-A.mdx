Astronomers recently used the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to capture a rare glimpse of the young gas planet AF Lep b, located 88 light-years away. This exoplanet, just 23 million years old, is nearing its star, making it invisible for over a decade. The JWST's coronagraph blocked 90% of the star's light, allowing the telescope to detect AF Lep b's faint glow.

The JWST's spectrograph revealed that AF Lep b, three times the mass of Jupiter, has a very active atmosphere, containing carbon monoxide. This discovery suggests strong updrafts in the planet's atmosphere.

The JWST, a collaboration between NASA, ESA, and the Canadian Space Agency, is designed to peer into the deepest parts of the cosmos. Its giant mirror, over 21 feet across, captures more light than the Hubble Space Telescope, enabling it to observe ancient stars and galaxies. Unlike Hubble, which primarily views visible light, the JWST is an infrared telescope, allowing it to see through cosmic clouds.

This technology also allows the JWST to analyze the atmospheres of distant exoplanets, identifying molecules like water, carbon dioxide, and methane. Astronomers are excited about the potential discoveries to come, not just about known planets, but also about those yet to be discovered.

In summary, the JWST's recent observations of AF Lep b mark a significant step in our understanding of exoplanets and the cosmos. The telescope's capabilities promise even more groundbreaking discoveries in the future.
