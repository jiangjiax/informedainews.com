Toho, the creator of the "Godzilla" franchise, has acquired U.S.-based GKIDS, the distributor of Studio Ghibli’s animated films. This move aims to boost Toho’s overseas expansion amid rising global interest in Japanese entertainment. GKIDS, known for distributing 13 Oscar-nominated animated films, will become a wholly-owned subsidiary. The deal reflects Toho’s strategy to focus on animation and international markets. GKIDS recently extended its streaming rights for Ghibli films with Warner Bros. Discovery.
