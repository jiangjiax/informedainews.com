Generative AI startups are raking in venture capital, grabbing 40% of all cloud-related investments. Accel's Euroscape report reveals a projected $79.2 billion in funding for cloud startups in the U.S., Europe, and Israel this year, driven by AI.

Cloud funding surged 27% annually, marking the first growth in three years. In 2023, cloud startups raised $62.5 billion, up 65% from four years ago. OpenAI, creator of ChatGPT, recently secured $6.6 billion, valuing the company at $157 billion.

AI is dominating cloud investments. Philippe Botteri of Accel notes, "AI is sucking the air out of the room." The Euroscape index, tracking public cloud firms, rose 19% year-over-year, lagging behind the Nasdaq's 38% increase.

Beyond AI, cloud firms face challenges: enterprise software budgets are squeezed by macroeconomic and geopolitical risks. Only one company in Accel's index saw revenue growth over 40% this year, compared to 23 in 2021.

Generative AI firms, particularly those building foundational models, are attracting significant funding. OpenAI led with $18.9 billion, followed by Anthropic and Elon Musk's xAI. In Europe, Wayve, Mistral, and Aleph Alpha secured the most funding.

The U.S. dominates global generative AI investment, with 80% of $56 billion going to American firms. Big Tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta are each investing $30-60 billion annually in AI.

Dev Ittycheria of MongoDB predicts a consolidation of powerful AI models to a few major players, driven by access to capital for data centers and chips.
