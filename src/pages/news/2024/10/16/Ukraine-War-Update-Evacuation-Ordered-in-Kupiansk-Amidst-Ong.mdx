Ukrainian authorities have ordered the mandatory evacuation of Kupiansk, a city in the north-eastern Kharkiv region, as Russian forces close in. The city, recaptured by Ukraine in 2022, faces severe winter challenges due to constant shelling, making it impossible to restore essential services like electricity, heat, and water.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been invited to present his "victory plan" to EU leaders, focusing on military support and energy grid reinforcement. Meanwhile, the US expresses concern over reports of North Korean soldiers fighting for Russia in Ukraine, signaling a potential new level of desperation for Moscow.

In Kyiv, a drone attack prompted officials to urge residents to seek shelter. Elsewhere, a Russian man jailed for his daughter's anti-war drawing was released, highlighting the harsh conditions faced by political prisoners.

Spanish authorities arrested four individuals suspected of running a sanctions-bypassing network, seizing 13 tonnes of chemical products bound for Russia. A survey revealed that four-fifths of Ukrainians support a law banning Russia-affiliated religious groups, reflecting ongoing tensions.

Russia is reducing its consular staff in Norway, and its Olympic chief is stepping down due to "geopolitical challenges," including the ban on Russian teams at the Paris Olympics.

**Insights:**
The situation in Ukraine remains dire, with both military and humanitarian crises deepening. International responses, from diplomatic expulsions to sanctions, indicate a global effort to pressure Russia. The personal stories, like that of the jailed father, underscore the human cost of the conflict.
