Laos, a nation rich in water resources, is set to pioneer a novel coffee roasting venture using green hydrogen. TSB Greenex, a Japanese environmental firm, has partnered with eight other companies to launch the Green Hydrogen Valley Project in Laos. The project aims to roast locally grown Arabica coffee beans using hydrogen fuel, produced from water via hydroelectricity.

Hydroelectricity, which accounts for 80% of Laos' power mix, is significantly cheaper than in Japan or Thailand. This cost advantage allows TSB to produce green hydrogen—separated from water using carbon-free electricity—at a competitive price, despite it being 20-30% more expensive than fossil fuel-derived hydrogen.

The coffee roasting plant, slated to open in Champasak province by mid-2026, will have a yearly capacity of 3,000 tonnes, comparable to Laos' largest coffee producer. The hydrogen-roasted coffee is expected to be 10-20% cheaper than conventional coffee, appealing to price-conscious consumers.

This initiative not only leverages Laos' natural resources but also positions the country to create value-added products, a crucial step in its economic development. The project could set a precedent for sustainable coffee production, blending environmental responsibility with economic viability.
