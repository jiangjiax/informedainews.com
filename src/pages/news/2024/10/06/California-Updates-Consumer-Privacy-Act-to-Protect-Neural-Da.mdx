California has updated its Consumer Privacy Act to include "neural data"â€”information collected from a person's brain or nerves. This data, previously unregulated, is now protected from unauthorized sale or sharing. Consumers gain rights to know what data is collected and to delete it. The law aims to safeguard mental privacy and sets a precedent for the neurotechnology industry.
