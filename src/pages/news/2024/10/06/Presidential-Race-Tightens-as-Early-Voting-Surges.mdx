More than 1.4 million people have cast their votes in the presidential election. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are neck-and-neck, crisscrossing the country in the final stretch.

Their vice-presidential picks, JD Vance and Tim Walz, faced off in the only vice-presidential debate. Initial polls suggest the debate had little impact on the race.

Harris's national polling average reached its highest since July. However, the race remains extremely close in battleground states. Harris leads in five of seven swing states, according to recent polls. But overall, both candidates have about even odds of winning.
