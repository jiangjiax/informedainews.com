Rio Tinto is in talks to buy Arcadium, a lithium miner. If the deal goes through, Rio would become the world's third-largest lithium producer, behind Albemarle and SQM. Arcadium, based in Philadelphia, could be valued between $4 billion and $6 billion.

Lithium is crucial for electric vehicle (EV) batteries. Demand is set to surge as EVs become more common. Arcadium's shares have dropped over 50% this year due to a slump in lithium prices, making it an attractive target.

Arcadium has mines and processing facilities on four continents. Its customers include Tesla, BMW, and General Motors. The company also has expertise in direct lithium extraction (DLE), a method that filters lithium from brines without evaporation ponds.

Rio Tinto, already a major copper and iron ore producer, aims to expand its lithium footprint. The deal could give Rio access to Arcadium's global operations and DLE technology.

Arcadium was formed in January by merging Livent and Allkem. Analysts see the merger as a strong case for Rio to buy Arcadium. The deal would also align with the mining industry's growing interest in critical minerals for the energy transition.
