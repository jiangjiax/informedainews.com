7-Eleven, once a beacon of retail wisdom, now faces an uncertain future. Its parent company, Seven&i Holdings, has received a preliminary acquisition offer from Alimentation Couche-Tard (ACT), a Canadian convenience store giant. If successful, this deal would be the largest foreign acquisition of a Japanese company and create a retail empire with over 200,000 stores.

ACT, with over 16,700 stores globally, has a history of aggressive acquisitions. Its strategy mirrors that of Chinese sportswear giant Anta, using mergers to expand rapidly. ACT's recent financials show growth but also regional weaknesses, particularly in the U.S. and Europe.

The proposed acquisition could be a game-changer for ACT, offering new growth opportunities and valuable Asian market insights. However, Seven&i has rejected the initial $39 billion offer, seeking a higher valuation.

This potential deal raises questions about 7-Eleven's legacy and the evolving retail landscape. ACT's ambition to dominate the global convenience store market is clear, but the path to success is fraught with challenges.

**Key Terms:**
- **EBITDA:** Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. A measure of a company's operating performance.
- **Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A):** Business strategies involving the combination of different companies or assets.
