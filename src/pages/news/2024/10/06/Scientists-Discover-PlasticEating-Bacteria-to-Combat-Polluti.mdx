Scientists discovered a bacteria, Comamonas testosteroni, that consumes plastic. This bacteria breaks down polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a common plastic found in bottles and packaging. PET accounts for 12% of global waste. Unlike other bacteria, C. testosteroni thrives on complex materials like plastics.

The researchers outlined six steps the bacteria use to break down plastic into a food source. These processes need optimization to work more quickly. Adding acetate, a chemical, could enhance their efficiency.

This discovery could be a crucial step toward solving plastic pollution.
