The EU plans to impose tariffs on 31% of China's electric car exports, based on Chinese customs data. In the first eight months of 2024, China exported $8.5 billion worth of electric vehicles to the EU, with Belgium leading purchases at $4.7 billion. The European Commission cites unfair Chinese subsidies as the reason for the tariffs. Both sides aim to negotiate a solution before the final decision on October 30.
