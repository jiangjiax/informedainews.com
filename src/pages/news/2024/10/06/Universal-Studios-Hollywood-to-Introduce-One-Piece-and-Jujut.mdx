Universal Studios Japan (USJ) will introduce "One Piece" and "Jujutsu Kaisen" attractions at Universal Studios Hollywood in April and May. These events mark a shift from US-centric content to popular Japanese anime. USJ’s focus on Japanese IP has proven successful, drawing 16 million visitors in 2023, ranking third globally. This move tests USJ’s planning expertise in the U.S., aiming to boost interest in Japan and its theme parks.
