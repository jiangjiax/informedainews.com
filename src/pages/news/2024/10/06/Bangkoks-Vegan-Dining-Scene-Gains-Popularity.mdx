Bangkok's vegan dining scene is booming, driven by social media and celebrity influence. Sittileun Tortianchai, co-owner of Veganerie, opened the first branch in 2014. Now, with seven outlets, the chain caters mainly to foreigners. Thailand, famous for its meat-centric street food, has a long-standing vegetarian tradition. During Buddhist holidays, many Thais adopt vegetarian diets.

Veganism, however, is relatively new. It's gaining traction, partly due to the "mindfulness" lifestyle popular in tourist spots like Koh Phangan and Pai. Bangkok's cosmopolitan vibe attracts expatriates and tourists, boosting demand for vegan options. Nat, manager of Plantiful, notes that while Western and Indian diners dominate, more Thais are trying vegan dishes.

For Thais, veganism isn't tied to Western ideological debates. Instead, it's seen as a healthy lifestyle choice, influenced by social media. Sittileun reports that 20% of Veganerie's customers are Thai, driven by health concerns rather than environmental issues.

The variety of vegan food is expanding. International dishes and vegan versions of Thai classics are becoming more common. Tofu often replaces meat or fish. Vistro, a vegan restaurant in Phrom Phong, was inspired by global vegan trends.

In summary, Bangkok's vegan scene is evolving, blending local traditions with international influences. Social media and celebrity endorsements play a crucial role, making veganism more accessible and appealing to a broader audience.
