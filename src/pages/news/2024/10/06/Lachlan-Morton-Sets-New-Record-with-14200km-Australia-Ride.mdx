Lachlan Morton, an Australian pro cyclist, has completed a 14,200km ride around Australia in just 30 days, nine hours, and 59 minutes. This shatters the previous record of 38 days set by David Alley in 2011. Morton averaged over 450km per day, riding through the night and sleeping for six or seven hours. He finished in Port Macquarie, his hometown.

The ride, undertaken to raise funds for the Indigenous Literacy Foundation, has so far collected $130,000. Morton rode anti-clockwise, passing through Sydney, Brisbane, Darwin, Broome, Perth, Esperance, Adelaide, and Melbourne. The rules required him to cover at least 14,200km and pass through these eight locations.

Morton faced physical and mental challenges, pushing himself into uncharted territory. He had a few close calls with road hazards, including a kangaroo, and deviated from his planned route for safety. Despite the hardships, he found strength in the relentless headwinds of Western Australia and South Australia.

Mortonâ€™s achievement is a testament to endurance and determination. His ride not only set a new record but also made a significant impact on remote Indigenous communities through his fundraising efforts.
