In Paris, basketball thrives. Darius Pollock, a 20-year-old Parisian, exemplifies the city's court culture, where Victor Wembanyama's NBA ascent fuels dreams. Basketball's popularity surges, with 750,000 registered players in France, a 170,000 increase since 2014. The sport's Olympic spotlight and the success of NBA stars like Tony Parker and Rudy Gobert inspire youth.

French basketball's success stems from INSEP, the National Institute of Sport, Expertise, and Performance, which since 1975 has honed elite athletes. INSEP's rigorous scouting and training cultivate exceptional talents early, ensuring few are overlooked. Graduates like Parker transition seamlessly to professional play, often entering the NBA.

French basketball, known for its athleticism, mirrors the NBA's style, easing player transitions. As France continues to produce top NBA draft picks, its basketball legacy strengthens, promising a bright future for the sport in the country.
