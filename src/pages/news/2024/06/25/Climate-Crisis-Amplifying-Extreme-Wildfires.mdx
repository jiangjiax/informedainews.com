Climate crisis fuels extreme wildfires, research reveals. These fires, catastrophic in loss and damage, are a direct result of climate change. Satellite data shows a tenfold increase in extreme fires over 20 years, particularly in temperate conifer forests and boreal regions. The intensity of these fires has doubled since 2003.

A concerning feedback loop emerges: fires release vast carbon, exacerbating global heating and igniting more fires. Smaller, human-started fires obscure this trend, as they cause less damage and may be declining.

Dr. Calum Cunningham emphasizes the urgency of action, highlighting the need to reduce fossil fuel use, manage forests, and learn from indigenous fire management practices. Effective alert systems and evacuation planning are crucial to save lives.

The stark reality: climate change is not a distant threat but a present, escalating disaster unfolding before us. Immediate, decisive action is imperative.
