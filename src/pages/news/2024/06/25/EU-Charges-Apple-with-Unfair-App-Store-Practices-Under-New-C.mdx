Apple faces charges under the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), accused of unfairly restricting app developers. The DMA, enacted in 2022, aims to curb the dominance of tech giants. Brussels regulators claim Apple's policies hinder competition and limit developer-customer communication outside the App Store. Penalties could reach 10-20% of Apple's global revenue, a staggering $383 billion last year. Margrethe Vestager asserts these policies increase developer dependency and obscure better consumer offers.
