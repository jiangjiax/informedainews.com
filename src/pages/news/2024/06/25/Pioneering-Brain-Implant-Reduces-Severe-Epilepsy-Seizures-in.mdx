In a groundbreaking medical feat, UK teenager Oran Knowlson, afflicted with severe epilepsy, has been fitted with a pioneering brain implant. This device, a neurostimulator, is designed to curtail seizures by sending targeted electrical signals deep into the brain. The result? An 80% reduction in daytime seizures for Oran.

Oran, diagnosed with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome—a particularly resistant form of epilepsy—had endured daily seizures since the age of three. The implant, known as Picostim, crafted by Amber Therapeutics, involves precise placement of electrodes within the thalamus, a critical brain hub.

Post-surgery, Oran's quality of life has markedly improved. His mother, Justine, reports a happier, more communicative son. The device, rechargeable via wearable headphones, delivers constant, mild electrical stimulation, effectively blocking seizure-causing electrical pathways.

This trial, set to expand to 22 patients, heralds a new era in epilepsy treatment, offering hope where few options existed. Consultant neurosurgeon Martin Tisdall expresses optimism, envisioning deep brain stimulation as a future standard treatment for pediatric epilepsy.
