Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, is expected to plead guilty to a US espionage charge. This plea could potentially end his imprisonment in Britain and allow his return to Australia. Assange, who is accused of conspiring to leak classified US documents, will face sentencing in Saipan. It is likely that his sentence will be time served, with no additional jail time.

In 2010, WikiLeaks released extensive amounts of US military and diplomatic secrets, including a highly publicized video of a US helicopter attack in Iraq. These leaks, initially prosecuted under the Trump administration, have ignited worldwide discussions on press freedom and government transparency.

Assange's legal journey began in 2010 with his arrest in Britain, followed by seeking asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy. His recent years have been marked by extradition battles and imprisonment in Belmarsh. Amidst these turbulent times, he married his partner, Stella, and they have two children together.

This plea represents a significant shift in Assange's ongoing dispute with US authorities, raising crucial questions about the limits of journalism and national security.
