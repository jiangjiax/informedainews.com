In the upcoming presidential debate, Biden faces scrutiny over his age and stamina, while Trump must temper his usual combative style to appeal to undecided voters. Biden, at 81, must prove his vigor against Trump, 78, who has a history of aggressive debate tactics. Trump, burdened by legal issues including 34 felony convictions and pending indictments, needs to present a positive, policy-focused vision to sway moderates.

The debate format, unique with muted microphones and no audience, aims to curb interruptions and maintain focus. Moderators from CNN, known for their critical coverage, will play a crucial role in managing the discourse. Both candidates navigate personal and political challenges, with Biden potentially addressing Trump's legal woes and Trump likely targeting Biden's son, Hunter, over his recent legal troubles and business dealings.

This debate, a rematch of 2020, is pivotal as it sets the tone for the 2024 election, testing the resilience of American democracy and the strategies of both campaigns.
