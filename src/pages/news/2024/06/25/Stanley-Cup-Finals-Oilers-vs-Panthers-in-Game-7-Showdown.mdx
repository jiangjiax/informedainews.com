Game 7, Oilers vs. Panthers, will determine the Stanley Cup champion. Edmonton, seeking Canada's first Cup since 1993, faces Florida, who is vying for their inaugural title. After Florida's early 3-0 lead, Edmonton's resurgence sets the stage for a dramatic conclusion.

Connor McDavid, Edmonton's captain, and Aleksander Barkov, Florida's leader, are poised to lift the Cup. McDavid, the favorite for the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP, stresses treating the game as routine despite its magnitude.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's endorsement highlights the national excitement in Canada. The game promises high stakes and intense emotions, with both teams eager to make their mark in hockey history.

The winning captain will receive the Cup from NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, fulfilling a lifelong dream for one team. The anticipation grows: Will it be McDavid or Barkov? The answer will be revealed in this decisive match.
