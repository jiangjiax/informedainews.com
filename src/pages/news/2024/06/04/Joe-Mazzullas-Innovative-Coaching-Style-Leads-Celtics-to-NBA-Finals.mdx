Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla, at 35 the youngest NBA Finals coach since 1969, has guided Boston to the championship series with a meticulous, detail-oriented approach. His practices simulate game-like scenarios, preparing players like Derrick White for critical moments, such as White's decisive 3-pointer in the Eastern Conference finals.

Mazzulla emphasizes a team-first culture, downplaying individual accolades among stars like Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. His coaching staff, carefully selected, focuses on both strategy and mental resilience, using metaphors like sandcastles to reinforce the need for constant rebuilding and adaptation.

Mazzulla's unconventional methods, referred to as "controlled madness" by player Jrue Holiday, include contesting practice shots and maintaining a relentless, uncomfortable pace for opponents. This approach, while unconventional, fosters a strong team bond and a competitive edge, crucial for Boston's pursuit of their 18th NBA title.
