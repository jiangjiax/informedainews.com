Saudi Arabia's Savvy Games Group, backed by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), seeks deeper ties with Japanese gaming giants Nintendo and Capcom. The goal is twofold: to localize Japanese games for the Middle East and to foster a native Saudi gaming industry.

Savvy, chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, aims to create a gaming hub in Saudi Arabia, training local talent and enticing Japanese developers to establish a regional presence. The company has substantial financial backing—142 billion riyals ($37.9 billion) from PIF—and already owns significant stakes in Nintendo and Capcom.

CEO Brian Ward plans to leverage these holdings for more impactful collaborations, focusing on acquiring "genre-leading titles" and enhancing esport capabilities. Savvy's ambitions include expanding its game development capacity, particularly for mobile platforms, with hopes to grow its in-house development team.

This initiative underscores Saudi Arabia's broader economic diversification strategy, aiming to shift from oil dependency to a more tech-driven economy by 2030.

**Explanation:**
- **Localization:** Adapting a product, like a video game, to meet the language and cultural nuances of a specific region.
- **Esport:** Competitive video gaming, often organized as professional events and tournaments.
- **M&A:** Mergers and Acquisitions, referring to the consolidation of companies or assets through various types of financial transactions.
