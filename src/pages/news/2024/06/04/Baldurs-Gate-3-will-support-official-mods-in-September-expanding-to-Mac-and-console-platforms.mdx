**Summary:**

Official mod support for "Baldur's Gate 3" is set to be introduced in September. Larian Studios has initiated a closed Alpha test, inviting a thousand mod developers to participate. Through collaboration with Mod.io, players will be able to create a diverse range of game content.

Mod support will extend to Mac and console platforms; however, due to the rules of console platforms and Hasbro's guidelines, certain mods will not be allowed for release on official platforms. Nevertheless, the official stance does not restrict third-party channels, permitting mods that are not suitable for all ages and those that significantly alter core game elements to be created and distributed using official tools.

Additionally, official mod support will enable seamless synchronization in multiplayer games and will introduce in-game photo mode and cross-platform gaming features in Patch 7.

**Explanation:**

- **Mod**: Add-ons created by players or developers that modify game content, adding new features, altering game rules, or enhancing the visual aesthetics of the game.
- **Closed Alpha Test**: A testing phase where typically only a select few participants are allowed to test new features or products to identify and fix issues.
- **Mod.io**: A platform that allows game developers to integrate mod support, enabling players to easily upload, share, and download mods.
- **Hasbro**: A large toy and game company that may have specific publishing guidelines for content based on games, such as "Baldur's Gate 3," which it holds the rights to.
