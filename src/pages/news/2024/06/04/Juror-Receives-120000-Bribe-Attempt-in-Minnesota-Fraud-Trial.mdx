A juror in a Minnesota fraud trial reported receiving a bag of $120,000 cash, with a promise of more if she acquitted seven defendants accused of stealing over $40 million meant for child feeding programs during the pandemic. These defendants, part of a larger group of 70, allegedly misused funds intended for feeding low-income children, diverting the money to luxury purchases.

The trial, which commenced in April, has witnessed defense attorneys questioning the FBI's investigation, arguing that discrepancies in record-keeping, rather than fraud, are at play. The initial seven defendants are associated with a restaurant that participated in the food aid program. The founder of Feeding Our Future, one of the implicated nonprofits, has entered a plea of not guilty.

Upon receiving the cash, the juror promptly reported it to the police. Concerned about the trial's integrity, the judge opted to sequester the jury and confiscate the defendants' phones.

This case underscores the susceptibility of emergency relief programs to exploitation and emphasizes the critical need for rigorous oversight and accountability in the allocation of public funds.
