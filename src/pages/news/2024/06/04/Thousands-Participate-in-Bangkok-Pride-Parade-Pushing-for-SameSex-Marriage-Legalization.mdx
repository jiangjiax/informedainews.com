Thousands marched in Bangkok's Pride parade, signaling Thailand's potential to legalize same-sex marriage, a first in Southeast Asia. The event, part of Pride Month, drew over 200,000, advocating for LGBTQ rights. Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin's support aligns with his government's policy to equalize marriage laws. The bill, already passed by the lower house, awaits senate approval and royal assent. Legalization would extend rights like property inheritance to LGBTQ couples. A participant noted that legalization would silence critics of same-sex marriage.
