The PlayStation VR2 PC adapter is now official, scheduled to ship on August 7 for $59.99. This adapter connects Sony's PS5-exclusive VR headset with PC gaming, allowing compatibility with Steam VR titles such as "Half-Life: Alyx."

To utilize the adapter, a DisplayPort cable is also necessary. Although the adapter supports high-resolution 4K visuals (2000 x 2040 per eye) and immersive features like 3D audio, certain PS5-specific functionalities—including HDR, head feedback, eye tracking, and adaptive triggers—will not operate on PC.

Sony initially suggested PC support for PSVR 2 in February, a development that broadens the headset's applicability beyond PlayStation-exclusive games.
