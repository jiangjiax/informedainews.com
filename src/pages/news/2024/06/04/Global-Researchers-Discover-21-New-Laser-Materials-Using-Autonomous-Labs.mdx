Global researchers, utilizing autonomous labs, have accelerated the discovery of 21 new laser materials, a process that traditionally spanned decades. These labs, driven by AI and robotics, compressed years of work into just months.

Organic Solid-State Lasers (OSLs), renowned for their versatility and efficiency, hold significant promise across diverse applications. However, their production is intricate, frequently necessitating over 150,000 experiments to pinpoint suitable materials. Historically, only a few new OSL materials have met the criteria.

The breakthrough emerged from a network of labs distributed across Canada, the UK, the US, and Japan. Each lab brought unique expertise, boosting the project's efficiency and replicability. This collaborative, cloud-managed strategy democratized the discovery process, hastening the evolution of next-generation laser technology.

This approach, dubbed "delocalized asynchronous closed-loop discovery," marks a transformation in scientific research methodology, transitioning from localized endeavors to a globally integrated, efficient framework. It not only expedites material discovery but also establishes a benchmark for future scientific pursuits in material science and beyond.
