Russia targets Paris Olympics with deepfake Tom Cruise video.

A Kremlin-linked group, Storm-1679, created a fake documentary titled "Olympics Has Fallen," featuring a deepfake Tom Cruise. This documentary, falsely attributed to Netflix, criticizes the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and spreads fear of violence during the games.

Storm-1679 also produced spoof news reports and digitally generated images of graffiti threatening violence, aiming to undermine the Paris Olympics. Russia has a history of such tactics, including the Soviet Union's boycott of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.

Microsoft warns that these malign influence campaigns will likely expand, using more advanced AI to create convincing disinformation. This echoes similar tactics observed by China, which uses AI-generated material to interfere in foreign elections.

The use of AI in disinformation campaigns is a growing threat, blurring the lines between truth and fabrication, and undermining trust in media and institutions.
