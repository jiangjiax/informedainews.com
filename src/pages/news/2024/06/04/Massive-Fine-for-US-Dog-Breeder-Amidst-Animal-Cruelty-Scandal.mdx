Envigo RMS LLC, a US dog breeder for medical testing, faced a $35 million fine for animal cruelty after 4,000 beagles were rescued from its Virginia facility in 2022. This fine, the largest under the Animal Welfare Act, reflects severe neglect: dogs were denied basic veterinary care, fed contaminated food, and housed in unsafe conditions. Envigo's parent company, Inotiv, accepted the penalty and committed to stopping dog breeding for five years. The rescue effort triggered a nationwide campaign to find homes for the beagles.

This case highlights a profit-driven culture that compromises animal welfare and environmental standards. Envigo's negligence also included violations of the Clean Water Act, mishandling wastewater, and further jeopardizing the dogs and the environment. The settlement involves significant payments to the US government, the Virginia Animal Fighting Task Force, and the Humane Society for their involvement in the rescue.

This incident raises crucial questions about the ethics of animal testing and the oversight of such practices. It serves as a stark reminder of the responsibilities companies have in balancing profit with humane treatment and environmental stewardship.
