Coldplay, the British band, has significantly reduced its touring carbon footprint by 59% compared to their previous world tour. This reduction was achieved through innovative methods such as kinetic dancefloors, where dancing fans generate electricity, and the use of recyclable LED wristbands. The band also traveled by train to further minimize emissions.

In 2021, Coldplay announced a plan to lower emissions during their Music of the Spheres world tour, which began in 2022. They aimed to cut carbon emissions by at least 50% from show production, freight, and travel. Two years into the tour, they have exceeded this goal, partly due to fan participation in charging concerts using power bikes and kinetic dancefloors.

The band has also implemented measures to reduce waste, with 72% of tour waste being diverted from landfill for reuse, recycling, and composting. Additionally, for every ticket sold, a tree is planted through a global reforestation nonprofit.

Coldplay's efforts have been praised by MIT Professor John E Fernandez, who noted their leadership in pushing the music industry towards sustainability. Despite relying on air travel for most shows, frontman Chris Martin has committed to using public transport where possible, demonstrating a commitment to sustainable touring practices.

Kinetic dancefloors: Specialized floors that convert the energy from people jumping or dancing into electrical energy.
Recyclable LED wristbands: Light-emitting diode wristbands that can be recycled after use.
Carbon footprint: The total amount of greenhouse gases produced to directly and indirectly support human activities, usually expressed in equivalent tons of carbon dioxide (CO2).
