I've traveled extensively, residing in various accommodations, yet I prefer the intimacy of an apartment. Its charm lies in the privacy and the kitchen—a space entirely mine, reminiscent of home. Despite the unfamiliarity of foreign appliances, these kitchens provide a window into local life.

I am not a culinary enthusiast, yet I find pleasure in simple morning routines: brewing coffee, frying an egg, toasting bread. These scents capture the essence of home. As a child, the kitchen was a sanctuary, where my mother's presence and the aroma of festive foods—such as the rare oyster-filled zongzi during the Dragon Boat Festival—shaped my memories.

My own kitchen, modest yet fully equipped, has become a refuge, particularly in retirement and during my husband's illness. Our meals are straightforward, highlighting natural flavors. The aroma of rice, especially fragrant from Guanshan, Taiwan, indicates the ideal time to cook.

The kitchen, a fusion of tangible and intangible elements, encapsulates the complexity of home. Among its tools, the 10-person Taiwanese electric cooker, a constant throughout my marriage, is notable. It's versatile, used for a variety of dishes, symbolizing the enduring, multifaceted nature of both my kitchen and my marriage.
