High-speed rail meals have become a new trend. The railway department has introduced a series of affordable meals on high-speed trains in the Yangtze River Delta region, each costing no more than 30 yuan. These meals, including options like Honey Glazed BBQ Pork Rice and Teriyaki Chicken Leg Rice, among 15 varieties, are supplied via a hot chain system, meaning they are cooked fresh daily and delivered by dedicated staff onto the trains.

Since the start of the Spring Festival travel rush, this initiative has been implemented on nearly 200 high-speed train routes, with daily sales reaching approximately 18,000 portions, receiving widespread praise from passengers. The railway department regularly updates the menu according to seasonal changes to ensure the freshness and variety of the food.

**Explanation:**
- **High-speed rail**: A fast and efficient mode of railway transportation.
- **Yangtze River Delta region**: Refers to the area around the Yangtze River Delta on the eastern coast of China, including Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces, which is one of the most economically developed regions in China.
- **Hot chain meals**: Refers to food that is quickly cooled after cooking and kept refrigerated during transport until just before consumption, ensuring freshness and taste.

This service not only enhances the travel experience for passengers but also demonstrates the progress of Chinese railways in providing detailed services, actively responding to modern travel needs.
