Vote counting in India's general election is ongoing, with projections indicating a likely victory for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The election, which spanned seven phases since April, involved nearly 970 million eligible voters competing for 543 seats in the lower house, known as the Lok Sabha.

Modi, aiming for a third term, is primarily challenged by the Indian National Congress Party-led alliance. Key campaign issues included economic growth, unemployment, and religious tensions. A victory would extend Modi's tenure, positioning him as one of India's longest-serving leaders.
