Chang'e 6: A Sampling Journey to the Lunar Far Side

At 7:38 AM today, Chang'e 6 successfully lifted off from the lunar far side, carrying precious lunar samples into the predetermined orbit. This marks the world's first successful sampling and launch from the lunar far side.

Video footage captured Chang'e 6 ingeniously collecting lunar soil through both drilling tools and robotic arms in the extreme environment of the lunar far side. This "collect-as-you-drill" sampling method ensured the diversity and richness of the samples.

From June 2 to 3, Chang'e 6 completed intelligent rapid sampling in the South Pole-Aitken Basin on the lunar far side and safely sealed the samples. Subsequently, the ascent vehicle will dock with the orbiter and returner combination in lunar orbit to transfer the samples. The combination will then wait for the right moment to bring the samples back to Earth, with a planned landing at the Siziwang Banner landing site in Inner Mongolia.

These operations not only showcase China's space technology but also contribute valuable data and samples to global lunar scientific research.
