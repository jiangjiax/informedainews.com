China's rapid transition to renewable energy, known as the "Green Speed," has garnered worldwide attention. In 2023, as some countries scaled back their renewable energy goals, China forged ahead, becoming the only nation where the share of electricity in energy consumption continued to rise. The country installed over half of the world's new solar capacity and over 60% of wind power, doubling its solar and wind installations within just three years.

China's electric vehicle market penetration exceeds 30%, starkly contrasting with under 10% in the U.S. This acceleration in green energy could potentially lead to China's carbon emissions peaking earlier than its 2030 pledge. Analysts and experts, including those from the Norwegian International Climate and Environment Center, are astounded by China's unprecedented pace in renewable energy, marking a new era in global climate efforts.

This "Green Speed" is crucial for global carbon reduction, providing a model for developing countries to adopt green technologies at lower costs. The complexity of this transition, which requires significant investment and policy coordination, underscores China's leadership in energy innovation, supported by decades of focused policy on technology.

China's advancements in green energy are not only a national achievement but also a boon for global climate action, signaling a transformative shift in the world's energy base.
