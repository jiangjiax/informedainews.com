Summary:
In the evolving landscape of China's healthcare, the push for a more integrated and digital approach to managing health services is gaining momentum. The article highlights the challenges in the commercial health insurance sector, notably its limited product diversity and inadequate support for chronically ill patients. To address these, companies like Ruiyi Yaoda are spearheading a movement towards a more cohesive "medicine-insurance" model. This involves leveraging digital tools to enhance accessibility and management of healthcare services, aiming to improve patient outcomes and streamline the process from screening to treatment to management. The goal is a collaborative ecosystem where all stakeholders—patients, insurers, and healthcare providers—benefit from this innovative approach to payment and service delivery.

Explanation:
- **Digital Management**: Utilizing technology to oversee and optimize healthcare processes, making them more efficient and accessible.
- **Innovative Payment**: Refers to new methods of paying for healthcare that are designed to be more flexible and tailored to individual needs, often involving partnerships between insurers, healthcare providers, and pharmaceutical companies.
- **Ecosystem**: In this context, it describes a network where different entities (like insurers, healthcare providers, and patients) interact and support each other, creating a synergistic environment for better healthcare outcomes.
