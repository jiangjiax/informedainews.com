A man, Wu Qichuan, spent 41 years in jail for the alleged killing of a police officer in Taiwan. Despite multiple trials and doubts about the evidence, including the mismatch of bullet caliber and the trajectory of the gunshot, he continues to proclaim his innocence. Former president Chen Shui-bian supported Wu's case, even calling for a reenactment of the crime scene, but Wu was still initially sentenced to death. However, due to political changes, his sentence was eventually commuted to life imprisonment and then further reduced to 36 years. Now, with the support of the Taiwan Association for the Innocent, their hope is to bring Wu Qichuan's case back to court, aiming for his exoneration. The story illustrates the enduring struggle of a man who refuses to accept a wrongful conviction, with the hope of finally obtaining justice after decades of incarceration.
