The 4K restored version of "The Smiling, Proud Wanderer" will premiere at the Shanghai International Film Festival on June 19. This version represents a comprehensive upgrade from the 1990 original. The collaboration between director King Hu and executive directors Tsui Hark, Ching Siu-Tung, and Lee Lik-Chi has infused new vitality into the martial arts film genre. The theme song "The Sound of Laughing Waves" composed by James Wong is also a classic piece.

This restoration also includes "The Killer," "Project A," and "King of Beggars," all completed by the "Classic Hong Kong Film Restoration Project," initiated by the China Film Archive, Douyin, and Volcano Engine. Volcano Engine utilized AIGC visual large-model technology, significantly enhancing the clarity, fluidity, and color performance of the films.

AIGC visual large-model technology, which uses artificial intelligence to generate content (AI-generated content) for visual models, optimizes image quality through algorithms, rejuvenating old films.
