Summary:

Professor Wang Jun and his team from Sichuan University have made a breakthrough in the field of Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs), successfully developing a 15-junction VCSEL with an electro-optical conversion efficiency of 74%, breaking a two-decade stagnation in efficiency within the field. VCSELs are microcavity lasers known for their low cost, high reliability, and narrow spectral linewidth, and are widely used in consumer electronics and intelligent sensing systems.

The team's achievements not only enhance the power and efficiency of VCSELs but also reduce costs, which is significant for the fields of lidar and optical communications. Additionally, this technology is expected to drive the development of AI computing power data centers, meeting the growing demand.

Insights:

The research by Wang Jun's team not only achieves technological breakthroughs but also provides new perspectives at the fundamental physical level, challenging traditional understandings. This innovative approach, starting from basic principles, is a driving force for technological progress. With the advancement of AI technology, future integration of AI in chip design and optimization will further enhance research and development efficiency, reduce costs, and accelerate the transformation and application of technological achievements.
