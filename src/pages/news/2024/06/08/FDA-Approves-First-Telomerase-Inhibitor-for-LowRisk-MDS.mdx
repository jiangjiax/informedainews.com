Geron's Imetelstat, a pioneering telomerase inhibitor, approved by the FDA, targets low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (LR-MDS), alleviating transfusion-dependent anemia. Developed over 33 years, it significantly boosts rates of transfusion independence, with no new safety signals. MDS disrupts blood cell production, leading to anemia and infections. Frequent transfusions carry risks of iron overload and infections. A long-awaited breakthrough.
