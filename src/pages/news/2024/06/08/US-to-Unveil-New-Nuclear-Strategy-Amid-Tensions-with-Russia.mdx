The White House is set to reveal a "more assertive" nuclear strategy amidst tensions triggered by Russia's suspension of the New START Treaty. This new strategy involves the development of a fresh nuclear gravity bomb and the extension of the lifespan of Ohio-class submarines. The United States aims to strengthen its competitive stance in non-proliferation and arms control, ensuring that key allies have long-range strike capabilities.

Under pressure from Western actions in Ukraine, Russia has suspended its involvement in the New START Treaty, citing concerns over reciprocity and inspections. Nevertheless, Moscow maintains its openness to dialogue. The treaty, due to expire in 2026, presents a strategic consideration for future US administrations.

In response to Russia's treaty suspension, the US has ceased sharing missile launch information with Moscow. Meanwhile, Russia and Belarus have conducted drills involving non-strategic nuclear weapons, aimed at deterring further escalation from the West.

**Key Terms:**
- **New START Treaty:** A nuclear arms reduction treaty between the US and Russia, which limits the number of strategic nuclear warheads and delivery systems.
- **Non-strategic nuclear weapons:** Nuclear weapons not included in strategic arms treaties, usually smaller and designed for tactical use on the battlefield.
- **Ohio-class submarines:** US Navy submarines engineered for long-range strategic missile deployment.
