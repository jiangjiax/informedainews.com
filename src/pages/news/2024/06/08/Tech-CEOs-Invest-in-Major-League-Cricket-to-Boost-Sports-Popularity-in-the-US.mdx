High-profile tech CEOs, including Microsoft's Satya Nadella and Adobe's Shantanu Narayen, are investing nearly a billion dollars to popularize cricket in the U.S. through Major League Cricket. This league, featuring six professional teams, aims to mainstream cricket, targeting the large South Asian diaspora in America, known for their high incomes and passion for the sport. The Men's T20 Cricket World Cup, co-hosted by the U.S., has already witnessed a historic upset with the U.S. team defeating Pakistan. The upcoming India vs. Pakistan match is highly anticipated, with tickets averaging $1,300. These efforts reflect a strategic move to tap into a niche market with significant spending power, potentially reshaping the American sports landscape.
