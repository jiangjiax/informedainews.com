US President Joe Biden has apologized to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for delays in military aid, which allowed Russia to advance in Ukraine. Biden announced an additional $225 million in military support, emphasizing the ongoing US commitment. Zelenskiy, while in Paris, highlighted the importance of continued American and European support, drawing parallels between WWII and Ukraine's current struggle against Russian aggression.

Biden's apology relates to a six-month delay in Congress approving a $61 billion aid package, due to conservative opposition. The new US aid includes munitions for advanced rocket systems and artillery. NATO allies, including the US, now allow limited Ukrainian attacks inside Russia, marking a policy shift in response to intensified Russian offensives.

Zelenskiy, speaking to the French parliament, rejects peace based on current frontlines, arguing that any pause would only lead to future conflict. He hopes a Swiss-hosted peace summit will expedite a just resolution. Meanwhile, France plans to provide fighter jets and pilot training to Ukraine, indicating a deeper involvement in the conflict.

This situation highlights a critical moment in European security, where support for Ukraine is seen as crucial in resisting Russian expansionism.
