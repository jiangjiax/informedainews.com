Summary:
China Mobile has launched a free high-frequency spam call protection service, allowing users to participate in marking spam calls using the "number tagging" feature, thereby enhancing the efficiency of call blocking. This service can be managed through the official WeChat account, eliminating the need to download a separate app.

Explanation:
- High-frequency spam call protection service: A service that automatically blocks frequent spam calls to protect users from being disturbed.
- Number tagging: Users can mark phone numbers they believe to be spam, helping the system identify and block these numbers.
- Official WeChat account: An official account within WeChat where users can set up the service and view their call blocking records.
