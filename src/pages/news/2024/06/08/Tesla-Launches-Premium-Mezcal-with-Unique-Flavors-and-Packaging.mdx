Tesla introduces Tesla Mezcal, a premium spirit priced at $450, which blends the flavors of local ESPAD√çN and BICUISHE agaves. Alembic distillation imparts earthy notes with hints of lime, apple, spices, and smoke. The finish is floral, with hints of chamomile and a subtle bitterness. The bottle, shaped like a lightning bolt, is handcrafted, inspired by Oaxacan pottery traditions. Accompanying this release are COPITAS, black clay ceramic cups, sold in pairs for $55. This marks Tesla's latest venture into the beverage market, following previous releases like Tesla Tequila and CyberBeer+CyberStein sets.
