Open-ended AI, a system capable of continuous improvement and innovation, is now within reach. This paper posits that such systems are essential for attaining artificial superhuman intelligence (ASI).

The authors define open-endedness in terms of novelty and learnability, envisioning AI that can produce fresh, pertinent ideas and adapt accordingly. They suggest constructing these systems upon robust foundation models that have been trained on extensive datasets.

The objective is to develop AI that not only equals human intelligence but also transcends it, enabling discoveries beyond our present capacities. Nevertheless, this ambition brings substantial safety concerns, as generally capable, self-improving AI could present risks if not managed appropriately.

This research is set to become a pivotal, albeit potentially perilous, area in AI advancement. Striking a balance between innovation and safety will be crucial.
