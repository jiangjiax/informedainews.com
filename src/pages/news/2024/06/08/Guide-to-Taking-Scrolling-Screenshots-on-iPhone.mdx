Taking a screenshot on an iPhone is straightforward, involving a quick press of the volume up and side buttons. For longer captures, known as scrolling screenshots, the process is slightly more involved. These screenshots allow you to capture an entire webpage, document, or email in one go, rather than stitching together multiple images.

To create a scrolling screenshot:
1. Take a regular screenshot using the side and volume up buttons (or side/top and home buttons for Touch ID models).
2. Quickly tap the preview that appears in the bottom-left corner.
3. Select "Full Page" to see a preview of the entire capture.
4. Edit if necessary, then choose "Done."
5. Save as a PDF to Files or, if available, to Photos.

Long screenshots are typically saved as PDFs in the Files app, where they can be viewed, edited, and shared. If the screenshot fits within the screen's dimensions, it may also be saved directly to Photos.

This feature simplifies the capture of lengthy content, enhancing the iPhone's utility for documentation and sharing.
