Weight loss drugs Wegovy and Mounjaro are reshaping consumer habits, prompting a surge in related product lines. Companies like DSM Firmenich and Nestle are developing nutritional supplements and foods to complement these drugs, aiming to address potential side effects and nutritional gaps.

GLP-1 receptor agonists, the class of drugs used in Wegovy and Mounjaro, mimic a gut hormone that regulates appetite. While their impact on consumer behavior is still unfolding, industries from food to airlines are strategizing to capitalize on this trend. Airlines, for instance, could see significant fuel cost savings with lighter passengers.

However, the long-term effects and market sustainability of these drugs and their ancillary products remain uncertain. As competition intensifies, particularly in markets like China with numerous generic versions in development, the future of these 'miracle drugs' and their market influence is yet to be fully understood.
