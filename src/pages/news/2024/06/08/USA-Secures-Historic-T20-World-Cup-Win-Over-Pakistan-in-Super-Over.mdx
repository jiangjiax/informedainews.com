In the T20 World Cup, the USA secured a historic win over Pakistan in a thrilling Super Over held in Texas. Both teams managed to score 159 runs in their 20 overs, leading to a Super Over where the USA scored 18 for one, setting a target of 14 for Pakistan. Pakistan could only muster 13 for one, granting the USA their second successive victory in the tournament.

This victory is a significant milestone for cricket in the United States, which is co-hosting the tournament with the West Indies for the first time. USA captain Monank Patel highlighted the team's collective effort, emphasizing their strategic use of conditions and effective bowling.

Pakistan's captain, Babar Azam, recognized the USA's superior performance, pointing out his team's missed opportunities in batting. The USA's win not only enhances their prospects of advancing to the Super 8s but also suggests a potential rise in cricket's popularity within the country.

The Super Over is a tiebreaker in cricket where each team bats for one over (six balls) to score as many runs as possible. The team scoring more in this over is declared the winner.
