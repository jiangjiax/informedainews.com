France, led by Kylian Mbappé, faces familiar foes in Euro 2024's Group D: the Netherlands, Austria, and Poland. These teams share recent World Cup heartbreaks, all falling to Argentina in Qatar. France, champions in 2018, seeks redemption after a penalty shootout loss in Euro 2020's round of 16. Mbappé, now captain, aims to extend his scoring dominance against these rivals, having netted twice against the Netherlands and Poland in recent encounters.

The Netherlands, under Ronald Koeman, have been efficient in qualifying, conceding just one goal. Koeman, returning after a stint at Barcelona, looks to leverage dynamic wing backs in a reshaped formation.

Austria, under Ralf Rangnick, shows promise despite injuries. Their midfield, featuring Bundesliga talents, remains a strength. However, key injuries to captain David Alaba and others pose challenges.

Poland, led by veteran Robert Lewandowski, faces an uncertain future under new coach Michał Probierz. Their World Cup performance was lackluster, and this tournament could mark the international farewell for Lewandowski, Poland's all-time leading scorer.

Group D promises intense rivalries and high stakes, with each team carrying the weight of recent disappointments and the ambition to rewrite their narratives at Euro 2024.
