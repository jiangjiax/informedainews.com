Netflix's interface, often restrictive, can be circumvented with a secret menu. This menu, accessible through specific URLs appended with numeric codes, unlocks over 36,000 niche genres and subcategories. For example, code 81466194 directs you to 90-Minute Movies, ideal for a quick watch.

These codes, available on sites like Netflix-Codes.com, enable users to delve beyond the standard genres displayed on the homepage. Categories vary from broad (Action, Comedy) to extremely specific (Movies Directed by Women, code 2974953).

To streamline access, a Chrome extension named Better Browse for Netflix can be installed. This tool introduces a "Browse All" option, facilitating easy navigation through these concealed categories.

This system allows viewers to personalize their experiences, bypassing Netflix's algorithm and uncovering content precisely suited to their preferences.
