To enhance gut health, it's beneficial to include probiotic foods in your diet, such as yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, and kimchi. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that promote digestive health.

Probiotics consist of live bacteria and yeasts that are beneficial for your health, particularly your digestive system. While bacteria are often perceived as harmful, your body naturally contains a mix of both good and bad bacteria. Probiotics are referred to as "good" or "friendly" bacteria because they contribute to maintaining a healthy gut.
