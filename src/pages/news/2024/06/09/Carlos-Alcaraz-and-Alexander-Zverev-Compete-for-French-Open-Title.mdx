In Paris, Carlos Alcaraz, 21, and Alexander Zverev, 27, compete for the French Open title. Alcaraz, already a champion on hard and grass courts, aims to expand his skills to clay, aspiring to match the versatility of tennis's Big Three: Nadal, Djokovic, and Federer. Zverev, yet to win a Grand Slam, contemplates his previous final defeats, acknowledging his growth and current readiness.

Both players are proficient on clay, with Alcaraz notably defeating Nadal and Djokovic in Madrid. Zverev holds a 12-match clay streak, including a recent victory over Nadal. This final represents a rare absence of the Big Three, indicating a change in the tennis landscape.

Alcaraz's goal is clear: to join Spanish legends by mastering all surfaces. Zverev, mature and resolute, questions, "If not now, then when?" Their encounter promises to inaugurate a new era in tennis history.
