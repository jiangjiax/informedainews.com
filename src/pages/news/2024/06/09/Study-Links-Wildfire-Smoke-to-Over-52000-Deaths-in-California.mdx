Wildfire smoke in California has been linked to over 52,000 deaths in the past decade, according to a study by UCLA researchers. The smoke, containing high levels of PM2.5 particles, infiltrates deep into lungs and bloodstreams, leading to severe health problems such as heart disease and asthma. These particles, which are also present in vehicle exhaust and indoor smoke, pose a particularly high risk when originating from wildfires.

The study emphasizes that PM2.5 from wildfires is more harmful than that from other sources, resulting in an estimated 12,000 premature deaths in 2018 alone. The economic impact is immense, with health costs totaling $432 billion over the decade.

This research highlights the urgent need for improved forest management and climate change mitigation strategies to lessen both the health and economic burdens of wildfires. As global warming exacerbates California's fire seasons, proactive measures are essential to protect public health and the economy.
