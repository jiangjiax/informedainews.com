Summary:

Venezuela's Humboldt Glacier, once the country's last glacier, has now melted away. Satellite imagery shows a reduction from 0.1 square kilometers in 2015 to almost non-existent by 2024. This change marks Venezuela as the first post-glacial nation in the Andes.

Explanation:

- Post-glacial period: Refers to the geologic period after glaciers have completely retreated.
- Satellite imagery: Images of the Earth's surface taken by artificial satellites, used for monitoring and studying changes on Earth.
- Tropical glaciers: Glaciers located in high-altitude areas near the equator, formed due to cold climates.

Insights:

The disappearance of glaciers is not just a geographical change but also a warning of climate change. The retreat of tropical glaciers reveals the harsh reality of global warming. This phenomenon, akin to an aging bullfighter, witnesses the relentless passage of time.
