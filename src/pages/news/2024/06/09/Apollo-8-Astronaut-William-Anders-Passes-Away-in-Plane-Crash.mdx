William Anders, the Apollo 8 astronaut and photographer of the iconic "Earthrise" image, passed away at 90 in a solo plane crash off the San Juan Islands. His legacy includes the first color photo of Earth from space, a poignant image that ignited the environmental movement by unveiling our planet's vulnerability.

A retired major general, Anders piloted the Apollo 8 mission, which was the first to orbit the moon. The "Earthrise" photo, taken during this mission, depicted Earth rising above the lunar surface, a striking contrast of color and life against the barren moonscape. This image profoundly altered humanity's view of Earth, highlighting its isolation and beauty within the cosmos.

Despite the inherent risks, Anders firmly believed in the mission's significance, estimating a one in three chance of failure. His bravery and the lasting impact of his work continue to inspire ongoing exploration and environmental responsibility.

Anders' life was distinguished by service, ranging from his tenure as a fighter pilot to his contributions in nuclear energy and diplomacy. He and his wife established the Heritage Flight Museum, dedicated to preserving aviation history. His loss is deeply felt by family, friends, and a world forever transformed by his cosmic vision.
