California takes the lead, mandating zero-emission vehicles by 2035. This policy, supported by 11 states, seeks to phase out gas-powered cars, thereby reducing air pollution and health costs. Each state, adhering to California's strict guidelines under the Clean Air Act, establishes its own timeline, with most converging on the 2035 deadline.

The transition is significant: electric vehicles (EVs) replace conventional cars, which release pollutants that contribute to climate change and health problems. EVs operate on electricity stored in batteries, generating no tailpipe emissions.

This shift, though challenging, is essential. It tackles environmental degradation and public health, aligning with broader climate objectives. The move to EVs is not merely about cleaner air but also about protecting natural landscapes and human health. It represents a step towards a sustainable future, where technology and policy unite to address environmental challenges.
