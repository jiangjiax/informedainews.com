UEFA plans to replenish its pandemic-depleted cash reserves through Euro 2024 in Germany, targeting €2.5 billion in revenue. This tournament, featuring 51 games across the country, is projected to generate a profit of €1.2 billion, vital for UEFA's financial stability and development grants.

Chosen as the host in 2018, Germany returns to hosting duties after 36 years, capitalizing on its economic prowess. The unforeseen impact of the pandemic has significantly influenced UEFA's strategy, as seen in the selection of the UK and Ireland for Euro 2028, emphasizing financial security.

UEFA's reserves, previously at €575 million, fell to €360 million post-pandemic. Euro 2024 is crucial, funding the "HatTrick" program, which aids member associations with up to €17 million each over four years.

Key sponsors like Adidas and Coca-Cola, along with broadcasters, play a significant role in revenue generation. Prize money for the tournament stands at €331 million, with clubs receiving €240 million for player releases, highlighting UEFA's commitment to equitable distribution.

This strategic move by UEFA highlights the critical role of major tournaments in stabilizing finances and fostering global soccer development.
