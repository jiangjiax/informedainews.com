Mark Cerny, architect of PS4 and PS5, clarifies that these consoles are not designed to be budget PCs. Instead, they leverage custom technology to enhance gaming experiences, potentially setting industry trends. Cerny notes that while PlayStation games are increasingly being ported to PC, the unique hardware of consoles can complicate this process. However, this challenge also offers opportunities for innovation.

Cerny highlights the PS5's advanced features, such as its high-speed SSD, which was a bold move that pressured the PC industry to improve their storage solutions. He also discusses the rapid adoption of technologies like ray tracing and the shift towards 60 frames per second gameplay, which were embraced faster than he anticipated.

The focus on reducing development time for game creation, termed "triangle generation time," has significantly improved from months to weeks on the PS4 and PS5. Despite this, game development still takes years due to the ambitious scope of modern games.

Cerny's insights reveal a strategic approach to console design, aiming not just for performance, but for pioneering technologies that can influence the broader gaming landscape.
