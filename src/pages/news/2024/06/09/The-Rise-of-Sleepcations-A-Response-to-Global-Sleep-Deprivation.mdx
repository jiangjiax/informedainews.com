Sleepcations, vacations designed for rest, are gaining popularity as people seek to reset their sleep patterns. These trips are part of a growing health and wellness tourism sector, valued at $400 billion by 2028. The trend reflects a global concern over sleep deprivation, which affects health and productivity, costing economies billions annually.

Sleep deprivation, a condition where individuals do not get enough sleep, can lead to serious health issues such as cardiovascular problems, diabetes, and cognitive impairment. It also impacts economic productivity, with significant losses reported in major economies.

The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated sleep issues, with many experiencing disturbances post-infection. To combat this, people are traveling to natural environments to help regulate their circadian rhythms, the body's internal clock that governs sleep and wakefulness.

Resorts like Grand Oak Manor in India offer serene settings that encourage physical activity and relaxation, aiding in better sleep. Similarly, locations like Pangong Tso in Ladakh provide calming atmospheres that enhance sleep quality.

In essence, sleepcations are not just a trend but a response to a silent epidemic of sleep deprivation, offering a path to better health and economic well-being.
