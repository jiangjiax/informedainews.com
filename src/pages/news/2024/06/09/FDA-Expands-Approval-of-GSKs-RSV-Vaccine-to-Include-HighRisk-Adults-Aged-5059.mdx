The FDA has expanded GSK's RSV vaccine approval to include high-risk adults aged 50-59. Arexvy, the vaccine, was initially approved for those aged 60 and above in May 2023. RSV, a virus that can cause severe illness and death in seniors, also significantly impacts adults with chronic conditions. GSK's vaccine, already a market leader, aims to broaden its reach and maintain dominance. The vaccine's efficacy and safety in the new age group are consistent with that observed in older adults, with mild side effects such as fatigue and headache. GSK plans further trials to expand the vaccine's use and is seeking approval in other countries.
