During the summer heat, set your thermostat to 78°F when you're at home, 82°F at night, and 85°F when you're away. In winter, keep it at 68°F and reduce it by 7-10°F for eight hours daily. This approach can reduce your annual energy bill by up to 10%.

A common misconception is that lowering the AC temperature cools the room faster; it actually only achieves a 15-20°F difference from the outdoor temperature.

Optimal thermostat placement is essential: avoid areas with drafts or direct sunlight. Install it on an interior wall in a frequently used area for the best performance.

Smart or programmable thermostats can automate these settings, minimizing manual adjustments and increasing energy savings.
