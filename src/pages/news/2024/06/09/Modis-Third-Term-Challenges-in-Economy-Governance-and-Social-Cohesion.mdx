Summary:

India enters "Modi 3.0" as Prime Minister Narendra Modi prepares for his third term, following a reduced majority in the recent elections. The Indian National Congress secured 240 seats, a decline from previous victories, signaling waning support. Economic growth, marked by stock market highs and increased wealth for the affluent, contrasts starkly with rising unemployment and persistent inequality among the masses. Governance remains a challenge, with bureaucratic hurdles and corruption hampering progress. Additionally, religious tensions, particularly between Hindus and Muslims, pose a significant risk to social cohesion. Modi's leadership faces the arduous task of balancing economic promises with social and governance reforms.
