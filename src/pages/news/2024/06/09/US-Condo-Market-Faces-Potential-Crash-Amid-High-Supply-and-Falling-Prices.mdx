The U.S. condo market is on the verge of collapse, with demand dwindling as the supply of new condos, especially in the Sun Belt, remains excessive. Prices have dropped by 20% since 2022, coinciding with a surge in multifamily housing loans.

The once-thriving apartment complex in Austin, Texas, now stands nearly vacant, serving as a stark emblem of the market's decline. Institutional investors, initially attracted by low interest rates, now grapple with a liquidity crisis as rates increase.

Real estate agent Matt Holm reports a 25% decrease in sale prices and a 10% drop in rents since 2021. High interest rates and an oversupply of properties for sale and rent are compounding the issue.

The Federal Reserve cautions of further price declines. Scott Trench of BiggerPockets notes that multifamily owners are holding onto hope, refraining from sales that would solidify their losses.

Increasing insurance premiums and maintenance costs are weighing heavily on property owners, who struggle to pass these expenses onto tenants amid high vacancy rates. The delinquency rate for multifamily loans has hit an all-time high, exceeding levels seen during the 2008 financial crisis.

With $500 billion in property loans coming due in 2024 and 2025, a failure to refinance could result in distressed sales, potentially setting off a broader decline in property prices and mirroring the events of the 2008 financial crisis.
