Georgia, amidst domestic strife, finds unity in its soccer team's historic qualification for Euro 2024. Led by Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, nicknamed "Kvaradona" for his Maradona-esque flair, Georgia enters its first European Championship since independence.

The team's qualification ignited nationwide celebrations, starkly contrasting with ongoing protests against a controversial media law. As an underdog in Group F, Georgia is set to face formidable opponents like Portugal, Turkey, and the Czech Republic. A single upset could pave the way to a knockout stage berth.

Kvaratskhelia's agility and motivation are crucial, yet the team's top-tier experience is limited. Coach Willy Sagnol, a Champions League winner with Bayern Munich, prioritizes performance over mere results.

Despite sporadic success in soccer post-Soviet Union, Georgian talent has occasionally made its mark, notably in the 1960 European Championship and the 1981 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. Rugby, however, has enjoyed more consistent national representation.

Georgia aspires to mirror Wales' 2016 Euro semifinal debut, focusing on delivering their best performance.
