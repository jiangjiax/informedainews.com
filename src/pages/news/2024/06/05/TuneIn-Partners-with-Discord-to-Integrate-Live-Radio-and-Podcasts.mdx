TuneIn, an audio streaming service, has partnered with Discord to offer live radio on the social platform. This marks TuneIn's first venture with a social network, aiming to expand its reach to Discord's 200 million users. TuneIn boasts 75 million monthly active users and provides access to 100,000 radio stations, podcasts, and curated music collections tailored for Discord, including genres like K-pop and Lofi.

The integration, titled "TuneIn Radio & Podcasts," is available through Discord's Activities feature, which allows shared experiences in voice channels. Users can access TuneIn via the rocket icon in voice channels on desktop, mobile, and web platforms, enabling them to listen to music or podcasts while interacting with friends.

Rich Stern, TuneIn CEO, emphasizes the curated experience for Discord and hints at potential future partnerships with other communication platforms and devices. TuneIn's strategy aligns with a broader mission to make radio accessible across various platforms, including smart home devices and vehicles.

This partnership not only enhances Discord's entertainment offerings but also positions TuneIn to tap into a younger, tech-savvy demographic, potentially reshaping how users engage with radio and podcasts in a social setting.
