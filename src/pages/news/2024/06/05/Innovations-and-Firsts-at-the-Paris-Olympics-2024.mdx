The Paris Olympics, celebrating a century since its last appearance in the city, introduces several groundbreaking changes. The opening ceremony, a historic first, will see athletes parading along the Seine River, providing a spectacle accessible to a wide audience, distinct from the usual stadium-bound events. This ambitious move, however, poses significant security challenges.

Gender parity is another significant milestone, with an equal number of male and female athletes participating for the first time. This marks a considerable evolution from the 1900 Paris Olympics, where only 22 women competed.

Prize money for gold medalists, a controversial change, will be directly funded by Olympic revenues, a decision opposed by the IOC but supported by World Athletics.

Breakdancing makes its Olympic debut, highlighting a sport with origins in the Bronx, New York. However, its future in the Olympics is uncertain, as it is not included in the 2028 Los Angeles Games.

Lastly, surfing events will take place in Tahiti, a considerable distance from Paris, emphasizing the global scope of the Olympics.

These innovations, while ambitious, reflect the evolving nature of the Olympics, striving to balance tradition with modernity and inclusivity.
