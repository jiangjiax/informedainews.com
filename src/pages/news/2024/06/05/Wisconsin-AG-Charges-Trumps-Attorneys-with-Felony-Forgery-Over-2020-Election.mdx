Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul has charged two attorneys and an aide who worked for Trump in 2020 with felony forgery. The trio allegedly submitted false documents claiming Trump won Wisconsin, aiming to influence the Electoral College.

Electors, chosen by the popular vote winner in each state, officially cast votes in the Electoral College, which confirms presidential election results. Despite losing Wisconsin, Trump's team attempted to install fake electors to overturn the election outcome.

This tactic mirrors actions in other swing states, though investigations have consistently debunked claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. Trump continues to propagate these untruths, particularly in Wisconsin, a key swing state.

The charges highlight a broader legal scrutiny of Trump's efforts to subvert the election results, with similar cases emerging in Michigan and Nevada. The legal repercussions for these actions are now unfolding in courts, marking a significant chapter in American electoral integrity.
