Summary:

Professor Wang Jun and his team from Sichuan University have achieved a breakthrough in the field of Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs), successfully developing a 15-junction VCSEL with an electrical-to-optical conversion efficiency of 74%, breaking a two-decade stagnation in efficiency within the field. VCSELs are known for their low cost, high reliability, and narrow spectral linewidth, and are widely used in consumer electronics and optical communications. The innovation of Wang Jun's team lies in their multi-junction cascade design, which significantly enhances power and efficiency, bringing revolutionary advancements to areas such as autonomous driving and AI computing data centers.

Insights:

The research by Wang Jun's team not only represents a technological breakthrough but also offers new perspectives at the fundamental physics level. By delving deeply into basic physics, they discovered methods for enhancing efficiency beyond conventional understanding. This innovation, rooted in underlying principles, is the true driver of technological progress. Moreover, the application prospects of this technology are vast, with benefits extending from autonomous driving to data centers. In the future, integrating AI technology to optimize design and production processes will further accelerate the development of this field.
