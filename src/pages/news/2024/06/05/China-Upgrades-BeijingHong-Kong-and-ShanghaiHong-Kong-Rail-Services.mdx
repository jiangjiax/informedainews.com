Starting from June 15, China's railway network has upgraded the Beijing-Hong Kong and Shanghai-Hong Kong routes, transforming the existing Z97/98 and Z99/100 trains into the faster, overnight D909/910 and D907/908 high-speed rail services. These new trains, which depart in the evening and arrive by morning, significantly reduce travel times: Beijing to Hong Kong from 24 hours and 31 minutes to 12 hours and 34 minutes, and Shanghai to Hong Kong from 19 hours and 34 minutes to 11 hours and 14 minutes.

The D909 departs Beijing at 20:13 and arrives in Hong Kong at 08:47 the next day. Conversely, the D910 leaves Hong Kong at 18:24 and reaches Beijing by 06:53. Similarly, the D907 and D908 connect Shanghai and Hong Kong, with respective travel times of 11 hours and 14 minutes.

Furthermore, the railway has expanded services between Hong Kong and other major cities, including Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and a new route to Zhangjiajie. These enhancements increase daily high-speed rail options between Hong Kong and mainland China to a maximum of 127 pairs, reaching 16 provinces.

This overhaul not only accelerates travel but also deepens economic and cultural ties between Hong Kong and the mainland, leveraging the efficiency of modern rail technology.
