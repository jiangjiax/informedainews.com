British bank Standard Chartered faces accusations of facilitating billions in transactions for terrorist funders, according to U.S. court documents. Despite previous allegations being "thoroughly discredited" by U.S. authorities, new evidence suggests the bank conducted over $100bn in transactions from 2008 to 2013, violating sanctions against Iran. An independent expert identified $9.6bn in transactions linked to terrorist groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, al-Qaeda, and the Taliban.

Standard Chartered allegedly falsified transaction data on Swift, an international payment system, to move funds through its New York branch for sanctioned entities, including the Central Bank of Iran. The bank has twice admitted to breaching sanctions, paying over $1.7bn in fines, but denies conducting transactions for terrorist organizations.

The new evidence, hidden in confidential bank spreadsheets, contradicts previous U.S. government claims that no new violations were discovered. Independent analysis by a CIA expert, David Scantling, reveals over half a million "cloaked" transactions, indicating ongoing dealings with Iranian and Middle Eastern entities linked to terrorist financing.

This revelation raises serious concerns about the bank's operations and the effectiveness of regulatory oversight, suggesting a deeper connection to terrorist financing than previously acknowledged.
