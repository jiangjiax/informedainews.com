Pop Mart, a company centered around trendy culture, is set to launch its self-developed mobile game "Dream Home". This game combines simulation management with party play, featuring characters closely tied to Pop Mart's classic IPs. Players will explore flying islands, participate in parties, and build their own homes.

After five years of preparation, the game has received praise similar to "Animal Crossing: New Horizons" during its beta testing phase. Pop Mart's move aims not only at profitability but also at integrating its gaming business with theme parks and other sectors to build a global trendy culture entertainment empire.

Media reports indicate that Pop Mart has been steadily growing in 2022, with an expected 30% increase in revenue for 2023, and the launch of new businesses like games is part of its strategic expansion.
