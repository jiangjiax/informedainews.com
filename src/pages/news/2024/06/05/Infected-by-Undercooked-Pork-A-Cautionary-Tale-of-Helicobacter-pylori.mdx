A researcher's routine dinner at a local eatery unexpectedly turned into a challenging ordeal. After eating partially cooked pork, the individual suddenly lost their appetite, a condition that continued for days. Despite the absence of other symptoms such as fever or pain, the persistent lack of hunger was puzzling.

Upon seeking medical advice, an unusual event occurred during the consultation when the patient's stomach produced a loud, extended gurgling sound, reminiscent of Gollum from "The Lord of the Rings." Diagnosed with indigestion and gas, the medication prescribed did not alleviate the symptoms.

Further investigation led to a positive test for Helicobacter pylori (Hp), a bacterium associated with various gastrointestinal issues, including stomach ulcers and, in rare cases, cancer. Treatment with antibiotics quickly resolved the issue, restoring normal appetite and digestive function.

This experience highlights the importance of thoroughly cooking food to prevent bacterial infections and the necessity of timely medical intervention for digestive irregularities. The story serves as a reminder of the hidden risks in seemingly harmless meals and the importance of proper food preparation.
