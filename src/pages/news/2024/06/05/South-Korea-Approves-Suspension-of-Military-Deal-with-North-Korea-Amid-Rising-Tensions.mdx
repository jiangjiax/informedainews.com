South Korea has approved suspending a military agreement with North Korea, prompted by recent provocations including balloon launches carrying trash. This move, awaiting President Yoon Suk Yeol's signature, aims to strengthen South Korea's military readiness against ongoing threats from North Korea, such as nuclear weapon tests and GPS signal jamming.

The 2018 agreement, intended to reduce tensions by halting hostile military activities at the border, has faced criticism for potentially weakening South Korea's defenses while North Korea retains its nuclear capabilities. North Korea's recent balloon campaign, dropping waste materials over South Korea, escalated tensions further.

Suspending the agreement will allow South Korea to resume military drills and possibly restart propaganda broadcasts at the border, a tactic that historically has significant impact in North Korea, where access to foreign news is tightly controlled.

This decision reflects a shift from diplomatic efforts to a more defensive stance, highlighting the fragile and volatile nature of inter-Korean relations.
