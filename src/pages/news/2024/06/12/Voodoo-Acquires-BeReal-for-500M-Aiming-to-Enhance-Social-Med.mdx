Voodoo, a French mobile games publisher, acquired BeReal for €500 million. Despite having 40 million users, BeReal, which is known for its authentic, unfiltered social sharing, faced challenges in scaling its growth. Voodoo plans to utilize its expertise to accelerate BeReal's expansion and introduce new features. Alexis Barreyat, BeReal's founder, will step down after a transitional period, allowing Aymeric Roffé, the current CEO of Voodoo's Wizz, to take the helm at BeReal.

This acquisition highlights a growing trend towards authenticity in social media, offering a refreshing alternative to the polished, performative standards of platforms like Instagram. Voodoo's strategy could reshape how social networks interact with users, prioritizing genuine connections over curated content.
