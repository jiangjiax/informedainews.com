In Sudan, the ICC's Karim Khan is actively seeking evidence of atrocities as the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) launch an attack on a hospital in Darfur. The RSF, a paramilitary group, has escalated its conflict with the Sudanese army, resulting in over 120 fatalities in recent weeks.

The ongoing conflict in Sudan, which began in April of the previous year, has led to the loss of over 14,000 lives and the displacement of 10 million people. The United Nations has issued a warning of impending famine in the region if aid is not permitted to enter.

Khan's investigation has uncovered credible allegations of attacks on civilians, extensive sexual violence, and ethnically motivated assaults, with a particular focus on the Masalit community. The ICC, which is already investigating past atrocities in Sudan, is determined to prevent Darfur from being overlooked as another atrocity.

The RSF, formerly known as Janjaweed, was involved in previous genocidal acts during the tenure of former President Omar al-Bashir. Khan's appeal highlights the urgency of preventing a repeat of history in Darfur.
