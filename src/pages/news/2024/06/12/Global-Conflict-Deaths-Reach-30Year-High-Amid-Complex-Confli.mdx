Deaths from global conflicts have surged to a 30-year high since 2021, according to the Peace Research Institute Oslo. The spike is largely attributed to conflicts in Ethiopiaâ€™s Tigray region, Ukraine, and Gaza. Although there was a slight decrease in battlefield deaths last year, 2023 has seen 122,000 conflict-related fatalities, with significant numbers in Ukraine and Gaza.

The report underscores a growing complexity in global conflicts, with 59 conflict zones in 34 countries, many of which are experiencing multiple conflicts simultaneously. This complexity is further exacerbated by the expansion of groups like Islamic State and other armed Islamist factions across Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.

Africa leads in state-based conflicts, with 28 zones, while the Americas now host the most non-state conflicts, with Mexico being the most violent. The escalation in violence and the emergence of new, extremely violent conflicts pose significant challenges for aid and civil society organizations.

The world is a battlefield, more so now than in recent memory. The intertwining of local and global interests, the spread of extremist ideologies, and the fragmentation of conflict landscapes make peace a distant hope. The cost is measured in lives, the currency of despair.
