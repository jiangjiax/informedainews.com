Volkswagen, struggling to keep up with China's electric vehicle boom, has partnered with Xpeng to accelerate innovation. This year, as it celebrates 40 years with SAIC Motor, there is a shift where Chinese technology takes the lead. CEO Oliver Blume stresses the importance of integrating into China's tech ecosystem to quickly meet local customer expectations.

In 2023, Volkswagen acquired a 4.99% stake in Xpeng for $700 million, with the goal of co-developing two EVs by 2026. These vehicles will cater to local tastes, including features like karaoke and gaming, leveraging Xpeng's software to optimize electrical architecture and set the stage for future autonomous driving capabilities.

Volkswagen's R&D center in Hefei will expedite development, aiming for a 36-month cycle instead of 50. By 2030, the plan is to introduce 30 new EV models. Chinese automakers typically develop new vehicles within two years, a pace that Volkswagen is striving to match.

By collaborating with local suppliers such as Gotion High-tech and ThunderSoft, Volkswagen aims to enhance efficiency and speed, making all product decisions locally. Chinese brands currently hold over 60% of passenger vehicle market shares, while German and Japanese automakers face challenges with just 10%.

Other European automakers, including Renault and BMW, are also seeking Chinese partnerships for EV development, acknowledging the benefits in terms of cost and speed.
