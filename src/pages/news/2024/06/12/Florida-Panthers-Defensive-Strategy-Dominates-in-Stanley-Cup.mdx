The Florida Panthers excel in lockdown hockey, stifling opponents late in games. Their strategy, honed over two years under Coach Paul Maurice, emphasizes defense to preserve leads. In the Stanley Cup Final, they've dominated the Edmonton Oilers, leading for 73 minutes and outscoring them 28-11 in the third period. This approach, described as tenacious and aggressive, involves continuous pressure rather than defensive shelling. New additions like Vladimir Tarasenko and Kyle Okposo have adapted quickly, reinforcing the Panthers' identity as a team that wears down opponents through relentless play. As the series moves to Edmonton, the Panthers' method appears to be a winning formula, showcasing their readiness for a potential first championship.
