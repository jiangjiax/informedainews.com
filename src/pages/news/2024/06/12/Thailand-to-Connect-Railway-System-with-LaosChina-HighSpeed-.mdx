Thailand is set to integrate its railway system with the Laos-China high-speed network, aiming to boost regional trade and tourism. The State Railway of Thailand (SRT) has partnered with the Lao National Railway Authority to prepare for the July launch of the Thai-Lao rail link. This connection, originating from Bangkok's Krung Thep Aphiwat Central Station, will traverse through Udon Thani and Nong Khai, eventually connecting with Laos' Khamsawath Station in Vientiane.

This integration is anticipated to streamline logistics, expedite customs processes, and enhance exports, especially for perishable items like durian, which saw over 700,000 tonnes exported to China in 2022. The rail link will significantly reduce transit times to China, from two days by road to just 15 hours.

Economic projections indicate a 17% rise in Thai exports to China via this rail route, potentially reaching 250 billion baht this year. This development positions Thailand as a key logistics hub in the region, capitalizing on seamless transport connectivity with China, despite the absence of direct borders between the two countries.
