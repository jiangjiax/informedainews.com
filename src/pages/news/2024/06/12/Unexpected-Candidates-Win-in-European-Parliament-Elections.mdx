In the European Parliament elections, unexpected candidates emerged victorious, capitalizing on social media and unconventional platforms. Fidias Panayiotou, a Cypriot YouTuber with no prior political experience, secured a seat, indicating a shift in voter sentiment away from traditional parties. Similarly, in Spain, far-right influencer Alvise Perez won three seats through his anti-immigrant stance, underscoring the influence of digital platforms in politics.

In Germany, Maximilian Krah, despite being expelled from his party due to scandals, was elected, highlighting the tension between party loyalty and individual popularity. Greece witnessed a jailed politician, Fredi Beleris, winning a seat, which raised concerns about the integrity of the electoral process.

These results reflect a growing disenchantment with conventional politics and a readiness among voters to consider alternative voices, frequently discovered online. Social media's role as a political equalizer is clear, posing challenges to the established political order.
