Mastercard plans to eliminate manual card entry for online payments in Europe by 2030, transitioning to tokenization. This method replaces traditional card numbers with unique, randomly-generated tokens, aiming to enhance security, reduce fraud, and streamline payments with one-click transactions and biometric authentication such as thumbprints.

Already securing about 25% of global e-commerce transactions, tokenization is poised for rapid growth, potentially mitigating fraud losses forecasted to surpass $91 billion by 2028. Mastercard's initiative underscores a broader shift in payment innovations, steering towards more secure and convenient digital transactions.

This evolution in online payments mirrors past milestones like the introduction of credit cards and the adoption of contactless payments. Mastercard envisions a future where payment processes seamlessly integrate into daily life, from smartwatches to cars, enhancing both security and user convenience.
