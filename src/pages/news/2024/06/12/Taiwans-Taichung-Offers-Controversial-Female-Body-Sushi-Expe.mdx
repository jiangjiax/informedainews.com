In Taiwan, a private venue in Taichung has stirred controversy by offering a Japanese-inspired "Nyotaimori" experience, also known as "female body sushi." This involves serving sushi and sashimi on a nude female model, a practice that traces back to Japan's Edo period. The service, priced at NT$20,000, is available upon request and features local Taiwanese models.

Medical professionals caution about significant health risks, pointing to potential bacterial and viral infections from human skin, which can carry pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Norovirus. The human body's temperature, which is not ideal for preserving raw seafood, further increases the risk of food spoilage and associated health issues.

Despite these concerns, the practice has been featured by a prominent YouTuber, underscoring a cultural divide between traditional food safety norms and emerging, albeit controversial, dining trends.
