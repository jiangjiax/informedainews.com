TikTok, having conquered social media, now eyes Google's search throne. The platform is testing an image search feature in TikTok Shop, allowing users to snap or upload photos to find similar products. This tool, initially available in the U.S. and Southeast Asia, mimics Google Lens and Amazon's visual search capabilities.

TikTok's move is strategic, aiming to divert product searches from Google and Amazon to its own platform, where users can directly purchase items. With over 15 million sellers globally, TikTok Shop is positioned as a significant revenue stream. Despite political challenges, including a potential U.S. ban, TikTok aggressively expands its e-commerce features, betting on user engagement and sales through its app.

This shift underscores TikTok's ambition to dominate not just in entertainment but also in online shopping, challenging established tech giants on multiple fronts.
