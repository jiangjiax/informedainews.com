Flo-Jo's 1988 sprint records—10.49 in the 100m and 21.34 in the 200m—remain unbroken. However, as the Paris Games draw near, these times appear increasingly attainable. Sprinters such as Shericka Jackson and Elaine Thompson-Herah are rapidly closing the gap, with Jackson's 21.41 in the 200m and Thompson-Herah's 10.54 in the 100m representing significant progress. Al Joyner, Flo-Jo's widower, supports the quest to break these records, reflecting Flo-Jo's own belief that records are meant to be surpassed. The current generation of sprinters, undeterred by the historic benchmarks, embody a spirit of boundless potential, mirroring Flo-Jo's own philosophy. As the records stand on the precipice of being eclipsed, Flo-Jo's legacy—both her athletic achievements and her encouragement of future athletes—continues to thrive.
