Apple unveils a new Calculator app for iPad, set to debut with iPadOS 18. Initially codenamed Project GreyParrot, this app leverages the iPad's expansive screen with a tailored layout, harmonizing visually across iPhone, iPad, and Mac with round buttons in black and orange.

Key enhancements include a history tape sidebar and an improved unit conversion system, streamlining information management and eliminating the need to switch apps for calculation checks. Math Notes, accessible via a dedicated button, allows users to write complex expressions with an Apple Pencil, auto-completing them and adjusting results dynamically.

This feature supports variables and graphing expressions, enabling tasks from simple calculations to complex physics problems, such as calculating the maximum height of a table tennis ball under various conditions. Math Notes reduces reliance on third-party calculators like Calcbot, Soulver 3, or PCalc, appealing to a broad user base, from students to engineers.

The revamped Calculator app is universal, slated for release on iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia.
