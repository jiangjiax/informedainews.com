In La Paz, Bolivia, El Viejo Roble distillery crafts beer infused with coca leaves, a traditional ingredient stigmatized by its association with cocaine. Bolivia, a major coca producer, is striving for global acceptance of coca-based products, ranging from beer to toothpaste. The recent decision by the World Health Organization to review coca's non-narcotic benefits has ignited hope among Bolivian coca farmers and producers.

Coca, deeply ingrained in indigenous rituals and daily life, provides mild stimulation and is believed to offer health benefits. Despite its acceptance domestically, international markets remain cautious due to UN narcotics classifications. The Bolivian government is committed to destigmatizing coca, advocating for its legal export and presence in the global market.

The WHO's forthcoming study could potentially redefine coca's legal status by examining its medicinal and nutritional properties. For Bolivian coca farmers, this could signify economic salvation, as they grapple with dwindling foreign reserves and limited crop alternatives.

The U.S. and other Western nations are skeptical of coca cultivation, often linking it to drug trafficking. Bolivia's efforts to legitimize coca underscore a larger conflict between preserving cultural heritage and adhering to international drug policies. The outcome of the WHO study has the potential to not only reshape Bolivia's economy but also alter global perceptions of coca.
