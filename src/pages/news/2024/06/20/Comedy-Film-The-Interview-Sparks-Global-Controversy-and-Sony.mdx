In "The Interview," Seth Rogen and James Franco play with fire, crafting a comedy that sparks global controversy. The film, a satirical assassination plot against Kim Jong-un, draws the ire of North Korea, leading to a devastating hack on Sony. Rogen and Franco, initially amused by their creation, find themselves in a surreal situation, their film entangled in geopolitical tensions and corporate espionage.

The duo defends their work, noting that mockery of North Korea is not new, yet the consequences are unprecedented. The film, intended as a light-hearted jab, becomes a catalyst for real-world threats and a significant corporate security breach. Rogen and Franco remain resolute, unwilling to compromise the core of their story, despite external pressures.

This incident underscores the unpredictable impact of art on international relations, highlighting the thin line between entertainment and geopolitical risk. The film industry, often shielded by creative freedom, faces a stark reminder of its potential to stir powerful reactions.
