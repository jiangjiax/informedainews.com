Netflix, amidst rivals' cutbacks, is doubling down on Southeast Asia. Their strategy? Localized content. Inspired by the global hit "Squid Game," Netflix aims to replicate this success by producing more region-specific shows in Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines. This approach has already proven effective in Japan and South Korea, where localized series like "Squid Game" and adaptations like "One Piece" have not only captivated local audiences but also resonated worldwide.

In 2023, Asia accounted for just 11% of Netflix's revenue, yet its dense, youthful population presents vast potential. Netflix's VP for Asia content, Minyoung Kim, emphasizes the importance of stories that appeal both locally and globally. Recent hits like Thailand's "Hunger Game" and Indonesia's "Cigarette Girl" underscore the viability of this strategy. Upcoming releases, including Indonesian sci-fi "Nightmare & Daydream" and action film "The Shadow Strays," aim to further this momentum.

While competitors like Disney and Amazon scale back on content creation and streaming investments, Netflix sees an opportunity to expand, betting on the universal appeal of localized stories. This move not only diversifies their content but also deepens their market penetration in a region ripe for growth.
