Russian President Vladimir Putin's recent visit to Pyongyang marks a significant shift in global dynamics. Putin and Kim Jong Un signed a strategic partnership, effectively integrating North Korea into the emerging multipolar world. This alliance, akin to NATO's mutual defense clause, shields North Korea from potential US aggression and sanctions.

The partnership underscores a broader trend against US-led hegemony, accelerated by conflicts like the one in Ukraine. Putin acknowledged North Korea's support in these matters, hinting at a strengthening of ties beyond mere political alignment. Economic and cultural exchanges, such as Russian tourism to North Korea, are poised to increase.

This development is a clear challenge to the traditional "International Rules-Based Order," suggesting a reconfiguration of global power structures. The US, having long isolated North Korea, now faces a more unified front against its policies. The consequences of this realignment are profound, altering the balance of global influence and potentially reshaping international relations.
