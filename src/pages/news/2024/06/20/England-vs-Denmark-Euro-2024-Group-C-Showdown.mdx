England faces Denmark in a crucial Euro 2024 Group C match, a rematch of their intense Euro 2020 semifinal. England, coming off a 1-0 win over Serbia, tops the group, while Denmark looks for redemption after a 1-1 draw with Slovenia. The game, to be held at Frankfurt's Waldstadion, reignites old tensions stemming from a controversial penalty decision in their previous clash.

Denmark, in need of a win, has a challenging final group game against Serbia. The teams are familiar with each other, as several players from Manchester United, Crystal Palace, and Brentford have crossed paths. England's coach, Gareth Southgate, is considering tactical changes, possibly including Trent Alexander-Arnold in midfield.

A draw might be enough for Denmark, historically sufficient for third-place advancement in the expanded 24-team format. England is aiming for a historic double win to secure a favorable knockout round matchup. The stakes are high, with both teams cognizant of the upcoming challenges.
