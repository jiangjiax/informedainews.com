Chinese Premier Li Qiang is visiting Malaysia to commemorate 50 years of diplomatic relations. During the visit, it is expected that cooperation agreements on the digital economy and green development will be signed. Discussions will also cover trade, including territorial claims in the South China Sea. Malaysia is looking to enhance its economic ties with China through a new trade cooperation deal. Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's leader, is seeking closer ties with Beijing and has plans to join the BRICS bloc. Premier Li will participate in a groundbreaking ceremony for the East Coast Rail Link, a pivotal project under China's Belt and Road initiative. Both leaders will engage with the business community prior to Li's departure.
