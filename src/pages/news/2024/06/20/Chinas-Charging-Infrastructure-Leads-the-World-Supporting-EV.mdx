China boasts the world's largest charging infrastructure, totaling 992 million units, marking a 56% increase. Both public and private facilities experienced significant growth, rising by 46% and 61% respectively. The system is comprehensive, covering various service types and regions. Future plans include the addition of 3,000 charging stations and 5,000 charging spots at highway service areas across the nation, along with enhancements to infrastructure monitoring and integration of electric vehicles with the grid. This expansion is designed to support the escalating demand for electric vehicles and aligns with broader energy policies.
