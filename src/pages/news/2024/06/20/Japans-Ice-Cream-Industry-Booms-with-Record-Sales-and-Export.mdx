Japan's ice cream industry is thriving, with sales increasing by 10% in fiscal 2023 to reach 608.2 billion yen, marking a fourth consecutive record year. The demand is driven by hotter summers, with temperatures in 2023 being 1.76 degrees Celsius above average. Exports have surged, especially to Taiwan and China, totaling 7.8 billion yen, tripling since 2014. Companies such as Meiji and Imuraya are adapting by localizing production and introducing region-specific flavors, like durian-flavored mochi ice cream in Malaysia. Despite challenges such as inflation and export costs, the industry is looking to expand internationally.
