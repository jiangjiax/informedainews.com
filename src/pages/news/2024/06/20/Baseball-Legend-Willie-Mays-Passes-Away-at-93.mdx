Willie Mays, known as the "Say Hey Kid," has passed away at the age of 93. A towering figure in baseball, Mays captivated audiences with his power, speed, and unparalleled defensive skills. His illustrious career spanned 22 seasons, starting with the New York Giants, continuing with the San Francisco Giants, and concluding with a brief stint with the Mets.

Mays was a quintessential "five-tool" player: he excelled in hitting for average, hitting with power, base running, fielding, and throwing. His impressive .301 batting average, 660 home runs, and 3,293 hits highlight his exceptional abilities. Defensively, his record of 7,112 putouts and 12 Gold Glove awards are a testament to his prowess.

His most legendary moment occurred during the 1954 World Series with "the catch"â€”a spectacular over-the-shoulder grab that continues to amaze. Mays' influence transcended the field, as he was a pivotal figure in the integration of Major League Baseball and a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Mays' legacy is deeply ingrained in baseball history, serving as a beacon of excellence and a symbol of progress. His profound impact on the game and society stands as a testament to his enduring greatness.
