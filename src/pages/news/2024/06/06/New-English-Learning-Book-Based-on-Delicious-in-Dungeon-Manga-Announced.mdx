The Harta magazine is set to release an English learning book based on the fantasy culinary manga, "迷宫饭" (Delicious in Dungeon). Titled "迷宫饭 英语对话" (Delicious in Dungeon English Conversations), it will be available from August 2nd, priced at 1760 yen.

The book features over 300 English phrases, categorized into four sections: adventure, cooking, companions, and monsters. It also includes a special section with recipes, character profiles, and monster guides, aiming to blend language learning with the immersive world of the manga.
