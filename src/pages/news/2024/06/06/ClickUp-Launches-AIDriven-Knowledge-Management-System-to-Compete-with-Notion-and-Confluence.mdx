ClickUp, a productivity tool, now offers a knowledge management system. It integrates a wiki-like editor with AI, extracting data from sources such as Google Drive and Confluence. This centralizes business knowledge, challenging tools like Notion and Confluence.

CEO Zeb Evans views AI as essential for managing dispersed knowledge across platforms. ClickUp enables users to access, edit, and manage information on a single platform, enhancing efficiency.

The system includes templates for common documents and a chatbot that cites sources and suggests document creation based on queries. It adheres to user permissions, displaying only accessible information.

ClickUp's acquisition of Slapdash, a universal search tool, has been pivotal. This integration facilitates deep analysis of databases from connected applications, beyond just surface-level searches.

Evans aims to reduce time spent on administrative tasks by streamlining information access and management. This could decrease "work about work," making daily operations more efficient.
