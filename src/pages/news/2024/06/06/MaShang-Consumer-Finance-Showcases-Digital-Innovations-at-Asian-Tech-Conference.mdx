At the 2024 Asian Tech Conference in Singapore, China's technological prowess was prominently featured, with a special focus on Chongqing's digital financial innovations. **MaShang Consumer Finance Co., Ltd.** (**MaShang**) distinguished itself by demonstrating its dedication to digital inclusion and technological advancement.

MaShang introduced its proprietary **"Celestial Mirror"** financial model, an advanced AI system designed for critical financial applications. This model not only improves service accessibility for nearly 100 million rural and suburban "new citizens" but also enhances security, reducing potential risks by 99.9%.

The conference also showcased MaShang's **"Smart Livestock Breeding"** platform, which utilizes AI to optimize agricultural processes, significantly reducing costs and increasing sales. This initiative illustrates how technology can propel rural revitalization.

Chongqing, traditionally not a tech hub, is evolving into a digital financial center through strategic initiatives such as the "Intelligence, Integration, and Ease" project. The city's proactive adoption of digital transformation positions it as a significant player in the global digital economy.

MaShang's commitment to innovation is highlighted by its extensive patent portfolio and contributions to international standards, reinforcing its ambition to become a globally trusted financial services provider.

This event highlights the increasing influence of Chinese tech in global markets, demonstrating how innovation can bridge gaps in financial inclusion and stimulate economic development.
