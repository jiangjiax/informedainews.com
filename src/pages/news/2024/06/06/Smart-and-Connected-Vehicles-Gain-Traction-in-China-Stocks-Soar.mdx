Summary:

The integration of smart technology into vehicles is accelerating. By 2025, 75.9% of new cars in China will be equipped with built-in internet connectivity, according to forecasts. This surge is reflected in the stock market, with companies like Hongquan Material and Zhonghai Da experiencing significant gains.

The government is actively supporting this shift. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, along with other agencies, has approved nine consortia for pilot projects aimed at refining regulations and standards for smart vehicles. Additionally, a dedicated pool of 100 million phone numbers has been allocated for future car-to-everything (C-V2X) communications.

This move towards smart and connected vehicles is not just about convenience; it's a foundational shift in how we interact with transportation. As these technologies mature, they promise safer, more efficient travel, and could redefine the automotive industry's landscape.
