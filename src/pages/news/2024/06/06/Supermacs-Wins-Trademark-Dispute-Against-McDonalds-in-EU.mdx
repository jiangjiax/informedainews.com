Supermac's, an Irish takeaway, emerged victorious over McDonald's in a trademark dispute. The European court determined that McDonald's cannot exclusively use the term "Big Mac" for chicken burgers within the EU. This ruling comes after a 17-year legal struggle, during which Supermac's alleged that McDonald's engaged in "trademark intimidation"â€”a practice of registering names to hinder competitors.

The court concluded that McDonald's had not sufficiently proven the genuine use of the "Big Mac" trademark for specific goods and services. This decision paves the way for Supermac's to expand throughout Europe, potentially disrupting the market dominance of a global fast-food behemoth.

Trademark intimidation refers to the strategy of registering trademarks not for actual use, but to block others from using them, a tactic frequently employed by large corporations to stifle smaller competitors.
