Japan's birth rate has reached an all-time low, with only 727,277 births recorded in 2023, marking a 5.6% decrease from the previous year. The fertility rate is now 1.2, significantly below the 2.1 replacement level required to sustain a stable population. Marriages have also decreased by 6%, reflecting economic instability and difficulties in balancing work and family life.

In response, the government has allocated 5.3 trillion yen ($34 billion) to support childrearing and expand childcare services. However, experts argue that these measures primarily benefit existing or planned families and fail to address the underlying issues discouraging marriage and childbirth among the youth. Challenges such as poor job prospects, high living costs, and a gender-biased corporate culture deter young Japanese from starting families.

Japan's population, currently over 125 million, is projected to decline to 87 million by 2070, accompanied by a significant aging demographic. This demographic shift poses serious threats to the economy and national security, especially in the context of regional tensions with China.

**Insight:**
The crisis in Japan is indicative of deeper societal and economic issues beyond mere demographics. The government's response, although substantial, needs to tackle the broader cultural and economic barriers that hinder young people from marrying and having children. A change in societal expectations and workplace policies, along with economic incentives, is essential to create an environment supportive of family growth.
