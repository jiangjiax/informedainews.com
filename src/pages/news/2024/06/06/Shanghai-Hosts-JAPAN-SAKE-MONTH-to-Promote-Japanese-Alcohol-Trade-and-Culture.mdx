"JAPAN SAKE MONTH" was launched in Shanghai, featuring 108 Japanese companies and over 1000 types of sake, whiskey, and other spirits. This event, supported by various Chinese and Japanese government bodies, aims to enhance cultural exchange and stimulate trade.

The Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO) has set up a permanent "Japan Mall" at the Hongqiao Import Commodity Exhibition and Sales Center, facilitating the shift from exhibition to sales. This initiative not only benefits the local economy but also strengthens the relationship between China and Japan.

Although there has been a slight decrease in export numbers, China continues to be the largest market for Japanese alcohol. JETRO plans to expand its market reach, targeting not only Japanese restaurants but also Chinese and Western eateries, aiming to introduce Japanese beverages to a wider audience.

This strategic move reflects a long-term vision, akin to the approach taken by the wine industry, which took several years to establish itself in China. The potential for growth in the Japanese alcohol market is significant, indicating a promising future for this sector.
