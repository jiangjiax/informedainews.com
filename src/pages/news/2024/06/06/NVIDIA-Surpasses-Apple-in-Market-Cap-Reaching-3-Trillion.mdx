Summary:
On June 5, NVIDIA, a leading tech company, surpassed Apple in market capitalization, reaching $3 trillion. This milestone positions NVIDIA as the second-largest U.S. company by market value. Analysts attribute this surge to NVIDIA's strong performance in the stock market and its strategic positioning in the rapidly growing field of artificial intelligence. In contrast, Apple's market performance has been relatively stagnant, partly due to its slower integration of AI technologies.

NVIDIA's upcoming stock split, converting one share into ten, is expected to make the stock more accessible to individual investors, potentially boosting its market presence further.

Explanation:
- Market Capitalization: The total value of all a company's shares of stock. It is calculated by multiplying the price of a stock by the total number of outstanding shares.
- Stock Split: A corporate action where a company divides its existing shares into multiple shares to boost the stock's liquidity. Although the number of shares increases by a specific multiple, the total dollar value of the shares remains the same compared to pre-split amounts, except for adjustments in the stock price to reflect the split.

Insights:
NVIDIA's meteoric rise underscores the market's appetite for companies at the forefront of technological innovation, particularly in AI. The stock split, by making shares more affordable, could democratize investment in such high-growth sectors, potentially influencing broader market dynamics and investor behavior.
