CNCF launches the second Zero to Merge cohort, a four-week program commencing on June 10, 2024. Designed for individuals with basic programming skills and an understanding of cloud native principles, the course is centered around contributing to CNCF projects. Participants from over 20 countries will participate in live sessions, undertake practical tasks, and engage in collaborative learning.

The program emphasizes Empowerment, Collaboration, Inclusivity, Quality, Transparency, and Adaptability, creating a supportive environment for a diverse group of participants. Upon completion, attendees will be well-equipped to contribute effectively to CNCF projects, thereby enhancing community engagement and innovation.

This initiative is not merely about coding; it's about fostering a collaborative, learning-focused culture. The diverse cohort, comprising students, professionals, and independent contributors, promises a vibrant exchange of ideas across various cloud native domains.

For those interested in future cohorts, details are available on the sign-up page.
