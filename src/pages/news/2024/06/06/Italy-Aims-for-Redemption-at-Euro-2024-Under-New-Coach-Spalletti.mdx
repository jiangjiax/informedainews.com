Italy, fresh from the embarrassment of missing the World Cup, eyes redemption at Euro 2024. Coach Luciano Spalletti, who led Napoli to a thrilling Serie A victory, aims to instill pride and a positive Italian identity in his team. Despite a squad overhaul since their Euro 2021 triumph, Italy's new attacking style under Spalletti suggests a promising campaign.

Spalletti emphasizes the importance of national pride, dismissing players who trivialize the national team. His strategy includes integrating key players from Inter Milan and exploring options like Gianluca Scamacca and Mateo Retegui to fill gaps in the forward line.

As reigning champions, Italy faces a challenging group with Albania, Spain, and Croatia. Spalletti's focus on fostering a team ethos that transcends individual talent could be pivotal in their title defense.
