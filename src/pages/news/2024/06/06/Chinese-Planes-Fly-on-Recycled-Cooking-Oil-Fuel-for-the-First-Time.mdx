Today, two Chinese-made planes—an ARJ21 and a C919—flew on fuel partly made from recycled cooking oil, or "gutter oil." This blend, 40% bio-fuel, marks a first for domestic commercial aviation. The planes took off from Shandong and Shanghai, completing their flights without incident.

This bio-fuel, known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), promises up to 80% less carbon over its lifecycle. It's versatile, made from waste oils, garbage, or even captured CO2. The process, refined at a facility in Zhenhai, ensures the fuel meets all standards, indistinguishable from traditional jet fuel.

This flight isn't just about technology; it's a stride towards a greener aviation industry. By turning waste into fuel, China shows it can innovate and reduce its carbon footprint. A promising start, indeed.
