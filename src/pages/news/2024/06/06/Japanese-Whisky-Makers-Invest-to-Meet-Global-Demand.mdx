Japanese whisky makers, buoyed by rising global demand, are expanding their production capabilities. Nikka Whisky Distilling, in partnership with Asahi Breweries, plans to invest approximately $38 million to enhance storage facilities for malt whisky across three sites in Japan. This investment is part of a broader strategy to quadruple sales by 2040, capitalizing on a projected 2-3% annual growth in the global whisky market.

Nikka Whisky President Tamesada Kazutomo emphasizes the premium status of Japanese whisky, aiming to solidify its position among the world's top whiskies. Similarly, Suntory has committed around $64 million to upgrade distilleries in Osaka and Yamanashi, targeting completion by 2024.

These investments reflect a strategic move by Japanese whisky makers to meet anticipated demand, leveraging their reputation for quality to capture a larger share of the global market.
