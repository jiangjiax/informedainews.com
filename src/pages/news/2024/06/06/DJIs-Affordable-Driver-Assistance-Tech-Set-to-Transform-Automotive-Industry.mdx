DJI Automotive, a spin-off from the drone giant DJI, is transforming the affordability of driver assistance technology in cars. Utilizing drone technology, they provide Level 2 autonomy at a mere 5,000 yuan per vehicle, making it feasible even for cars priced around 100,000 yuan. This starkly contrasts with competitors like Huawei, whose systems are usually integrated into more expensive models.

At least 20 new models this year will incorporate DJI's technology, which employs cameras and affordable semiconductors instead of expensive lidar and radar systems. This method, inspired by DJI's Phantom 4 drone technology, enables vehicles to manage their direction and speed based on camera inputs.

The attraction of DJI Automotive's technology is its cost-effectiveness, potentially expediting the adoption of driver assistance systems. China, prioritizing such technology, targets Level 2 and 3 vehicles to account for 70% of new sales by 2030, with Level 4 vehicles comprising 20%.

DJI Automotive intends to launch a more advanced system by year-end, capable of self-driving on regular roads, priced at 7,000 yuan per vehicle. This initiative could further democratize autonomous driving technology, making it accessible to a wider market.

Level 2 autonomy pertains to systems that can manage steering and acceleration/deceleration under specific conditions, necessitating the driver to monitor the environment and be prepared to intervene. Level 4 autonomy allows the vehicle to handle all driving aspects in certain conditions without human intervention.
