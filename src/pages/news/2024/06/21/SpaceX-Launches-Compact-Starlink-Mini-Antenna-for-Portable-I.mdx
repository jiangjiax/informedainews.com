SpaceX introduces Starlink Mini, a compact satellite internet antenna priced at $599. Designed for mobility, it fits in a backpack and offers high-speed, low-latency internet on the go. This portable kit, smaller and lighter than the standard model, includes a built-in WiFi router and consumes less power.

The service costs an additional $30 per month on top of the $120 Residential fee, with a data cap of 50 gigabytes. Additional data is billed at $1 per gigabyte. Starlink Mini aims to make connectivity more accessible globally, with plans to expand internationally.

Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, predicts this product will revolutionize connectivity. With over 6,000 satellites in orbit, Starlink serves more than 3 million customers across 100 countries, expanding beyond consumer markets into sectors like national security and aviation.
