Nikkei Asia triumphs at SOPA Awards, securing the explanatory reporting prize for its series on "Asiaâ€™s Age of Hydropolitics." This series explores the intricate interplay of water politics, climate change, and regional conflicts, emphasizing the strategic maneuvers of nations such as China and India, and their downstream impacts.

The winning articles analyze the complex dynamics: China's water security ambitions and their ripple effects on neighboring countries; the contentious dam constructions between India and China, impacting millions in Bangladesh; and Vietnamese farmers' innovative responses to water scarcity caused by upstream dams.

Shin Nakayama, Nikkei Asia's Editor-in-Chief, credits this achievement to the collaborative efforts of a diverse regional team, reaffirming the publication's dedication to high-quality, Asia-focused journalism.

The SOPA Awards, a prestigious recognition in Asian media, celebrate excellence in journalism, rigorously evaluated by seasoned journalists and academics. This victory highlights Nikkei Asia's pivotal role in global media, tackling critical issues from an Asian perspective.
