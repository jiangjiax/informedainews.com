CS-Bench, a new bilingual benchmark, assesses large language models (LLMs) in the domain of computer science. It encompasses 26 subfields and evaluates over 30 models. The results indicate robust correlations between computer science, mathematical, and coding proficiencies. CS-Bench pinpoints areas for enhancement in LLMs and has the potential to reshape the evaluation of AI reasoning within computer science.
