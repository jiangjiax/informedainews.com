In a groundbreaking study, 36 healthy volunteers in the UK were deliberately infected with SARS-CoV-2 through their noses to explore natural COVID-19 immunity. This controlled experiment, led by UCL, meticulously tracked the virus's journey from entry to symptom onset, marking a first in COVID research.

The study unveiled distinct immune responses: some participants quickly eliminated the virus, while others struggled. Key findings highlighted increased activity of the HLA-DQA2 gene, a critical early warning for viral entry, and swift nasal immune responses in resilient individuals.

Significantly, patterns in activated T-cell receptors were identified, hinting at the potential for personalized T-cell therapies against COVID-19 and other immune-related diseases. This research, published in Nature, provides insights into early immune events that could inform the development of more effective vaccines and treatments.
