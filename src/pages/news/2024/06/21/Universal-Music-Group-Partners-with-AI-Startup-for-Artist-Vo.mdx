Universal Music Group (UMG) has partnered with AI startup SoundLabs to develop voice modeling technology. This summer, they will launch MicDrop, enabling UMG artists to create AI voice clones. This technology encompasses voice-to-instrument conversion and language transposition capabilities. Despite their popularity, AI voice clones have sparked controversy and legal concerns. For instance, a song featuring AI-generated vocals of Drake and The Weeknd was taken down from streaming platforms. Similarly, Drake encountered backlash and a cease-and-desist order for using a Tupac voice clone in a track, resulting in the song's removal.
