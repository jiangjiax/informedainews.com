CapCut, ByteDance's video editing app, has skyrocketed in popularity, amassing 200 million active users. Originally launched as JianYing in China, it underwent a rebranding and global expansion. CapCut stands out with its basic editing tools, templates, and AI-driven features, setting it apart from other free editors. Its appeal stems from the ability to repurpose viral content across platforms such as TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram.

Despite a 15-minute time limit and single track constraints, CapCut's user-friendly interface and social media-oriented features continue to attract users. The app is platform-agnostic, available on iOS, Android, and desktop. A Pro version, priced at $10 monthly or $90 annually, provides additional templates and features.

The future of CapCut in the US remains uncertain due to its connection with ByteDance. A potential TikTok ban could impact CapCut, considering its dependence on user content storage for AI editing. For now, it remains a robust tool for quick, creative video editing.
