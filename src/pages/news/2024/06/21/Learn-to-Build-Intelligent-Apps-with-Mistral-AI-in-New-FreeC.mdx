Open source LLMs from Mistral AI enable intelligent app creation without API call fees. A new course on freeCodeCamp.org, developed with Scrimba, teaches this skill. Over 25 lessons, learners explore Mistral's models and tools, building apps from simple chat completions to advanced features like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and function calling. Key topics include setting up vector databases, semantic search, and using Ollama for local model deployment. Ideal for quick, comprehensive learning in AI app development.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): A technique enhancing AI's ability to retrieve and generate information based on specific queries, improving the relevance and depth of AI responses.

Vector databases: Databases that store data as vectors, enabling efficient and accurate retrieval through similarity searches, crucial for AI applications requiring quick, relevant information access.
