WWDC 2024 introduced numerous iOS 18 features, though some intriguing additions went somewhat unnoticed. Notably, iPhone and iPad users will now have access to eye tracking, which enables hands-free navigation using gaze. Additionally, 'Math Notes' has been extended from iPadOS to iPhone, allowing users to solve equations with their finger, albeit without the adjustable dial of the Apple Pencil Pro.

The flashlight's beam width can now be adjusted, and pressing side buttons triggers bezel animations, which could be beneficial for future iPhones equipped with solid-state buttons. Lastly, sharing Wi-Fi passwords is made effortless with a QR code generated through the new Passwords app.

These features, while not prominently highlighted at WWDC, enhance the iOS experience, underscoring Apple's dedication to accessibility and user convenience.
