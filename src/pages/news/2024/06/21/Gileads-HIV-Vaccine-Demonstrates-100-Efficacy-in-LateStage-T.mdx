Gilead's HIV vaccine, requiring just two injections a year, demonstrated 100% effectiveness in a late-stage trial. Among 2000 women, none contracted HIV after vaccination. The data monitoring committee now recommends continuing the trial in a blinded manner and providing treatment for all participants. This breakthrough could revolutionize HIV prevention (PrEP) and strengthen Gilead's market presence. Shares rose by 7%. Jared Baeten, Vice President of HIV Clinical Development at Gilead, underscores the importance of offering diverse PrEP options to meet individual needs.
