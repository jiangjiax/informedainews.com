Object-oriented programming (OOP) organizes code into objects, which is ideal for complex applications. Its core principles include abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Abstraction conceals implementation details, revealing only essential functionalities. Encapsulation bundles data and methods within a class, managing access to internal information. Inheritance enables a class to acquire properties and behaviors from another, creating a hierarchy. Polymorphism allows objects to be utilized in various forms, increasing flexibility.

When these principles are applied, they result in software that is modular, scalable, and easier to maintain. Grasping OOP is crucial for developing robust systems.
