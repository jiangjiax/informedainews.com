In October 2023, hackers utilized Punycode to impersonate CNN's domain through Google ads, tricking users into contacting a fraudulent Microsoft support line. This scheme, possibly facilitated by an insider at CNN, employed Azure containers to bolster its authenticity. Google's insufficient ad review process failed to identify the malevolent purpose, underscoring a significant lapse in digital security.

Punycode: A technique for representing Unicode characters within ASCII, commonly employed in domain names to incorporate non-English characters.
