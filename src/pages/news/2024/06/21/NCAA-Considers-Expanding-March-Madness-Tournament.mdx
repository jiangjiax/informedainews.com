NCAA mulls March Madness expansion, weighing options to add four or eight teams to the current 68-team format. This proposal, presented to Division I conference commissioners, includes maintaining a 64-team bracket with additional play-in games for lower seeds. The impetus for expansion stems from a desire to capitalize on the tournament's popularity and recent financial successes, despite some reservations about the ideal structure of the event.

The NCAA's current TV deal, worth $8.8 billion and extending through 2032, would remain unaffected by minor expansions. However, the distribution of funds among conferences and schools could shift. Expansion would necessitate finding new venues for the First Four games, currently held in Dayton, which is already at capacity.

Support for expansion is divided, with larger conferences advocating for it and smaller leagues concerned about losing automatic bids and being relegated to play-in games. The earliest implementation could be the 2025-26 season.

The women's tournament, which recently achieved record viewership and attendance, mirrors the men's potential expansion, reflecting a broader trend of growth in women's sports visibility and investment.
