Instagram now offers live streaming to a select group of friends with its "Close Friends on Live" feature. This allows users to broadcast with up to three others, emphasizing private, intimate interactions. It marks a departure from public broadcasts, catering to those who value personal connections over mass audiences. This reflects Instagram's continuous effort to balance its platform between influencers and everyday users, aiming to revive the essence of early, friend-focused interactions.
