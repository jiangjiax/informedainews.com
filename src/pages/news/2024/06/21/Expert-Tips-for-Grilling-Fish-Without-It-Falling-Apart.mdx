Grilling fish can elevate your summer meals, offering a healthier alternative to traditional meats. Chef Akira Back, known for his seafood expertise, recommends choosing firm, meaty fish like tuna, salmon, snapper, sardines, and yellowtail amberjack for optimal grilling. These fish maintain their moisture and crisp up nicely on the grill.

To grill effectively, start with the fish skin-side down until crispy, then flip. A brief soak in cold, salt-vinegar water can help eliminate any fishy taste. Simple seasonings like citrus marinades, blackened seasoning, or just salt and pepper enhance the natural flavors. For a spicy twist, consider a Korean bulgogi marinade.

Tools like grill mats and baskets prevent delicate fish from falling apart, ensuring a clean grilling experience. Tuna, known for its rich flavor, requires minimal seasoning and careful, brief cooking to avoid overdoing it. Salmon, versatile and healthy, benefits from various accompaniments, while swordfish, with its meaty texture, pairs well with bold flavors like citrus or herbs.

Selecting the right fish and techniques can transform your grill into a seafood haven, bringing the freshness of the sea to your backyard.
