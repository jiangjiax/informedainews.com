The original Apple Pencil, despite its age, can be made to work with newer iPads using a specific setup: a Lightning female-to-female adapter, a Lightning to USB-C cable, and the LightBlue app for Bluetooth connections.

To pair the original Apple Pencil with a new iPad:
1. Disconnect it from the old iPad.
2. Use LightBlue to establish a new connection, entering the pairing code 1234.

This workaround enables the original Pencil to function on newer iPads, though it lacks newer features such as squeeze control. It remains a practical tool for drawing, writing, and basic iPad navigation, despite its cylindrical design that makes it prone to rolling.
