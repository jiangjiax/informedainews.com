UN poll reveals widespread desire for swift transition to clean energy in major fossil fuel nations. Despite economic reliance on oil, gas, and coal, citizens in countries like China, India, the US, and Saudi Arabia express strong support for rapid green energy shifts. The survey, involving 75,000 people across 77 nations, underscores a global consensus on the urgency of climate action, with 80% advocating for stronger commitments and 86% calling for international cooperation.

Achim Steiner, UNDP head, notes the "stunning" consensus amidst global conflicts and nationalism, highlighting public demand for faster, decisive action. The poll also reflects concerns over the impact of climate change on daily life, with 70% reporting that it influences major decisions.

This overwhelming public sentiment challenges leaders to align policies with the clear will of their constituents, pushing beyond fossil fuel interests towards a sustainable, equitable future.
