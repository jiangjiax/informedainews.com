Google introduces "Read Aloud" in Chrome for Android, enabling users to listen to web content in multiple languages, including Chinese. This feature, accessible via the browser's menu, operates independently of Google Assistant, enhancing convenience. Unlike Apple's Safari, which offers similar functionality, Google's approach keeps all operations within the browser. This feature is part of Chrome's ongoing enhancements, evident in the recent release of version 125.
