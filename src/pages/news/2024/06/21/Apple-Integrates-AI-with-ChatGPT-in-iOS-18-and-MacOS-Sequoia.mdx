Apple Intelligence debuts, integrating AI into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and MacOS Sequoia, with OpenAI's ChatGPT at its core. This strategic move by Apple is a response to competitors like Samsung, Google, and Microsoft, who have already embraced generative AI.

Apple's approach focuses on personal context, enhancing Siri's capabilities to understand and respond to natural language, follow-up questions, and on-screen content. Siri's updates include enhanced on-screen awareness and the ability to execute tasks within apps, leveraging personal context for more efficient assistance.

Productivity tools are enhanced, offering features such as email prioritization, message summarization, and writing assistance across various apps. Apple emphasizes privacy, with many AI models running on-device and utilizing Private Cloud Compute for tasks requiring greater processing power.

Apple's integration of AI aims to differentiate itself by personalizing technology, ensuring it's not just smart, but relevant to each user's unique context.
