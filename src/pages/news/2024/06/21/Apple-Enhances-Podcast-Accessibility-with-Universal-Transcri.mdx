Apple's journey to podcast transcripts began in 2018, with the goal of enhancing accessibility for the hearing-impaired. Initially, transcripts were used to provide context for search results, but over seven years, they evolved into a comprehensive feature. Inspired by Apple Books and Music, these transcripts now include time-synced highlighting and customizable aesthetics. Unlike competitors such as Amazon Music and Spotify, which restrict transcripts to certain shows, Apple transcribes every new episode and plans to cover its entire podcast library. This commitment to universal accessibility not only benefits its intended audience but also enhances the podcast experience for all listeners. Apple's approach highlights a broader principle: by focusing on the needs of the marginalized, they improve the product for everyone.
