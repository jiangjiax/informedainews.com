In China, vocational education is undergoing a significant transformation from passive observation to active engagement in industry, akin to the transition from "borrowing a boat to see the sea" to "building a ship to sail the seas." This evolution is exemplified by institutions such as Shenzhen Polytechnic, which aligns its curriculum closely with local industrial needs and collaborates with companies like BYD to offer practical training experiences.

The integration of education and industry, referred to as "solidifying the chain," involves a tight collaboration among government, schools, and businesses to ensure that educational programs align with both current and future market demands. This approach not only enhances the relevance of education but also accelerates the shift towards a manufacturing powerhouse.

Vocational schools are strategically situated within industrial parks, facilitating a smooth transition from the classroom to the workplace. This close proximity enables the immediate application of theoretical knowledge in real-world settings, significantly reducing the need for additional on-the-job training.

Furthermore, Chinese vocational education is expanding its global influence, adapting and exporting its educational models to countries along the Belt and Road Initiative. This international outreach not only supports global economic development but also positions China as a leader in innovative educational practices.

The transformation of vocational education in China reflects a strategic alignment with national industrial goals, ensuring that education serves as a dynamic force in economic development.
