Deadly heatwaves, intensified by global warming, scorched Mexico, Central America, and the southern US. These extreme temperatures, 35 times more likely due to human-induced climate change, shattered records and caused widespread suffering, particularly among the marginalized.

The heat dome, a high-pressure zone trapping hot air, led to unprecedented temperatures, exacerbating drought, pollution, and infrastructure strain. At least 125 deaths in Mexico and numerous heat-related incidents in the US underscore the crisis.

Climate scientists warn that without curbing fossil fuels, such deadly heatwaves will become routine. The impact extends beyond health, threatening power supplies, agriculture, and water resources.

The urgency is clear: reduce emissions or face escalating heat-related deaths and disruptions. Governments must act comprehensively, from urban planning to worker protections, to mitigate this escalating threat.
