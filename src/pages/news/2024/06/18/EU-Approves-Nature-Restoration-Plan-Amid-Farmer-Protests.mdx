EU nations have approved the Nature Restoration Plan, despite farmer protests. This plan, integral to the European Green Deal, targets the restoration of 20% of EU land and sea by 2030. Austria's backing broke a deadlock, although its coalition government remains divided. Critics contend the plan is detrimental to farmers, while proponents view it as essential for climate and biodiversity.

This decision, though controversial, demonstrates a commitment to long-term environmental health over immediate economic interests. It highlights the EU's ambition to lead in climate and biodiversity protection, setting a global precedent.
