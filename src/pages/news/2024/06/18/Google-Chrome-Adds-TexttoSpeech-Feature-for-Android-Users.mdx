Google introduces "Read Aloud" in Chrome for Android, enabling users to listen to web content in various languages, including Chinese. This feature, available via the browser's menu, functions independently of Google Assistant, adding to its convenience. Unlike Apple's Safari, which provides similar capabilities, Google's implementation maintains all operations within the browser. This feature is part of Chrome's continuous enhancements, highlighted in the recent release of version 125.
