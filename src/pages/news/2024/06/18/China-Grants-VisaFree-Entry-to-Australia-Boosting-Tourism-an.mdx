China announced on June 17th that Australia will be included in its list of single-entry visa-free countries. This decision has sparked a surge in interest among Australian travelers, with search volumes for China-related travel on Trip.com spiking by over 80% within half an hour of the announcement. The move coincides with a significant increase in flights between the two nations, recording a 220% rise in the number of flights to China from Australia this year.

Australia now stands as the fifth-largest source of inbound tourists to China, experiencing a 155% increase in tourism orders. Popular destinations among Australian visitors include major cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou. The upcoming summer season is marked by a nearly 30% reduction in airfare prices compared to last year.

The visa-free policy is anticipated to boost tourism and economic interactions between China and Australia, benefiting over a million Chinese expatriates residing in Australia. It also underscores the growing economic complementarity between the two countries and a mutual intent to enhance ties in the tourism sector.

This policy change not only streamlines travel for Australians and Chinese expatriates but also facilitates cultural exchange, enabling more individuals to directly experience the dynamic changes in China. The impact on inbound tourism is already noticeable, with significant increases in visitor numbers from countries previously granted similar visa-free access.
