K-pop group TOMORROW X TOGETHER is set to debut a virtual reality (VR) concert this fall, produced by AmazeVR in collaboration with BIGHIT and HYBE 360. The HYPERFOCUS: TOMORROW X TOGETHER VR CONCERT, commencing in August, will embark on a tour of five U.S. cities, showcasing hits like "Deja Vu" and "Sugar Rush Ride." Each performance, captured live, strives to authentically recreate the energy of a live concert, complemented by personal messages from the band members.

AmazeVR's CEO, Steve Lee, emphasizes unique VR features, such as customizable camera angles, enabling fans to tailor their viewing experience. This event adds to AmazeVR's repertoire, which includes previous VR concerts for artists like Megan Thee Stallion and aespa.

The production harnesses cutting-edge technology, incorporating AI for lighting, special effects, and compositingâ€”a technique that blends live-action footage with 3D environments. This AI-driven integration guarantees a smooth and immersive VR experience, redefining the conventions of concert viewing.
