German prosecutors have unveiled the country's largest cocaine bust, valued at â‚¬2.6 billion, confiscated from multiple container ships. The 35.5 tonnes of cocaine, found in Hamburg, Rotterdam, and Colombia, were hidden within shipments of fruits and vegetables. This operation, triggered by a tip from Colombia, resulted in the arrest of seven individuals from various countries.

The suspects, employing front companies and a sophisticated network of 100 shell companies, masterminded the smuggling of cocaine from Latin America to Europe. Authorities confiscated significant assets during the arrests, including a Porsche and gold bars.

This seizure represents a significant blow to international drug trafficking, disrupting the influx of cocaine into Europe and affecting the operations of global drug kingpins.
