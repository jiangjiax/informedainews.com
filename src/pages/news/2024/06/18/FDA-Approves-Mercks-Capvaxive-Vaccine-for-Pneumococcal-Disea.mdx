The FDA has approved Merck's Capvaxive, a pneumococcal vaccine designed specifically for adults, targeting 21 strains of bacteria. This vaccine is intended to prevent severe pneumococcal diseases, including pneumonia, which hospitalizes approximately 150,000 U.S. adults each year. Capvaxive provides broader protection than current vaccines, potentially covering 85% of invasive cases in adults over 65, compared to 51% coverage by Pfizer's Prevnar 20. Merck expects rapid adoption of Capvaxive, positioning it as a key growth driver amidst the impending loss of exclusivity for its cancer drug, Keytruda. The CDC's advisory panel will establish eligibility for the vaccine, with Merck prepared to supply it by late summer.
