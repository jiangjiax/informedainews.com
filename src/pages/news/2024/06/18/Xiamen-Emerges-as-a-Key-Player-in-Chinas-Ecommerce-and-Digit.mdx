In June, the digital landscape of Xiamen experienced a significant transformation with the establishment of Sanzhiyang Group's Xiamen branch, spearheaded by its founder with a billion followers, Xiao Yang Ge. This development signified a strategic initiative to capitalize on Fujian's thriving tea industry, with the goal of creating a national e-commerce hub for premium tea resources.

Concurrently, Xiamen's beauty industry saw a surge on TikTok, with local brands such as Dr. Wen, VC, and Zao Wu Zhe leading in sales, outperforming well-known international brands. These TikTok-native brands concentrate on select SKUs, popular products, and substantial advertising investments, achieving high returns on investment through strategic celebrity endorsements.

Xiamen's e-commerce strategy, known as "technical flow," involves meticulous analysis of TikTok's algorithms to enable precise ad targeting and high profitability, distinguishing it from other TikTok hubs like Yiwu and Guangzhou, which emphasize low pricing and direct factory sales, respectively.

The city's digital capabilities are further enhanced by TikTok's significant presence, including substantial investments and strategic operations. As Xiamen continues to evolve, its dedication to e-commerce is clear, with new policies designed to elevate its position as a leading digital commerce center.

This synergy between local entrepreneurial spirit and global technological influence positions Xiamen as a key player in China's e-commerce landscape, shaping a future where digital innovation and traditional industries seamlessly integrate.
