A class-action lawsuit against the NFL challenges the "Sunday Ticket" pricing and distribution. Subscribers argue that the league violated antitrust laws by inflating prices and restricting the package to a single satellite provider. The NFL defends its actions under an antitrust exemption for broadcasting, although the plaintiffs assert this exemption only pertains to over-the-air broadcasts.

Initially dismissed, the case was later reinstated by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. It now encompasses over 2.4 million residential subscribers and 48,000 businesses that purchased the package between 2011 and 2023. The NFL could face up to $21 billion in potential damages if found liable.

This legal battle highlights the NFL's vulnerability in court, especially in Los Angeles, where antitrust issues have traditionally not been in the league's favor. The outcome of this case could significantly influence how other major sports leagues manage their out-of-market packages, potentially altering the dynamics of sports broadcasting rights.
