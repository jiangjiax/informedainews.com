Apple's journey to podcast transcripts began in 2018, with the goal of enhancing accessibility for the hearing-impaired. Initially, transcripts were used to provide context for search results, but over seven years, they evolved into a comprehensive feature. Drawing inspiration from Apple Books and Music, transcripts now include time-synced highlighting and adjustable aesthetics. Unlike competitors such as Amazon Music and Spotify, which limit transcripts to select shows, Apple transcribes every new episode and plans to cover its entire podcast library. This commitment to universal accessibility not only benefits its intended audience but also enhances the podcast experience for all listeners. Apple's approach highlights a broader principle: by focusing on the needs of the margins, they improve the product for the masses.
