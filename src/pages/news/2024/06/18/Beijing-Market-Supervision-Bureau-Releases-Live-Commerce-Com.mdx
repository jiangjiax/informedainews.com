The Beijing Municipal Market Supervision管理局 has issued the "Guidelines for Compliance in Live Commerce," aimed at standardizing the industry and protecting consumer rights. The guidelines explicitly prohibit the use of misleading expressions such as "lowest price across all platforms" and require platforms to establish inspection systems to promptly address violations. Additionally, it emphasizes that live content should be wholesome, opposing unhealthy trends, and strictly regulates advertising content, forbidding any mention of medical functions or guaranteed promises.

**Personal Insight**
This move reflects the market's self-purification process. In the long run, it will contribute to the healthy development of live commerce, safeguard consumer interests, and promote fair competition.
