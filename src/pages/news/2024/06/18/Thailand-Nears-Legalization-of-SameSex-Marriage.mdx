Thailand edges towards legalizing same-sex marriage, poised to be the first in Southeast Asia to do so. The senate is set to approve the legislation, which alters marriage laws to include gender-neutral terms and grants same-sex couples equal rights in adoption and inheritance. If passed, the law will follow Taiwan and Nepal as the third in Asia to recognize marriage equality.

Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin, a vocal supporter, plans to open his residence for celebrations post-vote. Activists anticipate the first weddings by October, despite criticism that the law does not fully address transgender and non-binary rights.

Thailand, known for its LGBTQ+ tolerance, sees overwhelming public support for the bill, marking a significant stride in equal rights despite traditional conservative undercurrents.
