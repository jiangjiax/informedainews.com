The Celtics claim their 18th NBA title, surpassing the Lakers' record. Led by Jayson Tatum's 31 points, Boston secured a decisive 106-88 victory over Dallas in Game 5. This win marks the Celtics' 18th championship, the most in NBA history. Jaylen Brown, named Finals MVP, highlighted his successful partnership with Tatum, noting that together they have played more playoff games than any duo before claiming a title.

Boston's impressive postseason, finishing with a 16-3 record, underscores their strategic emphasis on high-volume three-point shooting and top-tier defense. Coach Joe Mazzulla, at 35, becomes the youngest coach to win a championship since Bill Russell in 1969.

This victory represents the culmination of a journey that started with the trade of Garnett and Pierce, which led to the draft picks for Tatum and Brown. Their growth into All-Stars has solidified Boston's status as a dominant force, overcoming past playoff setbacks to achieve this historic milestone.
