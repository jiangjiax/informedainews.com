Shaun White, Olympic snowboarding legend, launches The Snow League, a season-long halfpipe competition offering over $1.5 million in prizes. Aiming to streamline the fragmented action sports calendar, the league debuts next March, spanning until the 2026 Winter Olympics. Initially focused on snowboarding, with plans to integrate freeskiing, the league aspires to rival prestigious sports events like Wimbledon or the NBA Finals.

White, recalling his youth competing for substantial prizes in Japan, seeks to revive such lucrative rewards, enhancing the sport's visibility and financial appeal. The league, endorsed by US Ski & Snowboard and supported by top riders like Chloe Kim, aims to provide a consistent, high-profile platform for athletes, contrasting the sporadic exposure of standalone events.

This initiative underscores White's enduring impact on snowboarding, transitioning from competitor to architect of its future, aiming to elevate the sport's stature and athlete opportunities. The Snow League promises a structured, lucrative stage for snowboarding's elite, potentially reshaping the sport's professional landscape.
