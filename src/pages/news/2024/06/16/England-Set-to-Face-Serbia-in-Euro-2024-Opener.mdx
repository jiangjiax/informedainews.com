England, aiming to break a 58-year trophy drought, kicks off Euro 2024 against Serbia in Group C. Gareth Southgate, potentially in his last tournament, depends on key players like Jude Bellingham and Harry Kane. Serbia, under the leadership of Aleksandar Mitrovic, presents a significant challenge. Enhanced security measures are in place due to concerns over fan violence.

England's strong performances in previous Euros, barring penalty shootouts, are noteworthy. Bellingham's impressive season with Real Madrid strengthens England's midfield. Mitrovic, coming off a successful period in Saudi Arabia, could pose problems for England's defense.

Southgate's strategic choices, including possible midfield adjustments involving Trent Alexander-Arnold, are critical. Kane, England's leading scorer, is eager to win his first major trophy. Serbia's aerial prowess, demonstrated during the qualifiers, adds complexity to the match.

The match, classified as high risk, will see restricted alcohol sales. Both teams, mindful of past surprises, approach the game with cautious optimism. Southgate's development as a manager and the team's preparedness will be put to the test.
