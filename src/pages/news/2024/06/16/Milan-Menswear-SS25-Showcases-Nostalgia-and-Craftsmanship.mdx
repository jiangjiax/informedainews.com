Amid global turmoil, Milan's menswear for Spring-Summer 2025 embraced nostalgia and artisanal craft. Designers, seeking solace in past decades, showcased collections that blended old-world charm with climate-conscious designs.

Dolce & Gabbana's collection, inspired by 1950s Italy, featured loose silhouettes and artisanal weaves, ideal for seaside elegance. Woven raffia and leather, paired with scalloped knitwear, echoed a bygone era of ease and sophistication.

Fendi, under Silvia Venturini Fendi, revisited classic menswear with a twist. Oversized shirts, lightweight bombers, and inventive knitwear with asymmetrical details offered a modern take on tradition. The collection, rich in plaids and geometric prints, balanced with a muted palette of khaki, lime, and sand.

Both brands, while rooted in nostalgia, subtly addressed contemporary concerns, hinting at a future where style and sustainability coexist. The shift in fashion's narrative, from escapism to thoughtful innovation, reflects a broader societal shift towards mindful consumption.
