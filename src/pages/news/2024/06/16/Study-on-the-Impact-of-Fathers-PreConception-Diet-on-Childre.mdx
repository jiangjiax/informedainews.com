New research reveals that a father's diet before conception significantly impacts his child's health, particularly in the risk of metabolic diseases. Led by Dr. Rafael Tapperino, studies at Munich's Helmholtz Center focused on small RNA molecules in sperm, known as mt-tsRNAs, which regulate gene expression and influence health traits across generations.

The study, utilizing data from over 3000 families in the LIFE Child Cohort, found that paternal weight directly affects a child's weight and susceptibility to metabolic diseases, independent of maternal factors or genetics. Further experiments with mice fed a high-fat diet demonstrated increased metabolic disease risks in offspring, confirming the impact of paternal diet on reproductive cells.

Notably, the research highlighted the role of mt-tsRNAs, which are fragments of mitochondrial tRNA. Mitochondria, often termed the cell's powerhouse, possess their own DNA (mtDNA) and RNA, traditionally thought to be solely maternally inherited. However, recent findings show that sperm carries mt-RNA into the egg, influencing early embryonic gene expression and, consequently, offspring health.

This study underscores the importance of paternal preconception health, particularly diet, in mitigating risks of obesity and diabetes in children. It challenges traditional views on mitochondrial inheritance, emphasizing the paternal contribution to offspring's metabolic health through indirect genetic mechanisms.
