Over 100 world leaders convene at a Swiss resort to develop a peace plan for Ukraine. Amid the G7's â‚¬50 billion loan agreement, the summit concentrates on Kyiv's 10-point proposal, addressing nuclear threats, food security, and humanitarian needs. Russia's demands for land and troop withdrawal are rejected, with UN principles of sovereignty strongly emphasized. President Zelenskiy seeks international support; China's absence is noted, and Moscow dismisses the meeting. This diplomatic achievement occurs despite military setbacks and war fatigue.
