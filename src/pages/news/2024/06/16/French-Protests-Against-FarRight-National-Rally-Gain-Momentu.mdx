In Paris, a surge of protest against the far-right National Rally, fresh from European Parliament election victories, signals deep concern over impending parliamentary elections. The fear: a far-right government, a first since WWII.

French unions, antiracism groups, and a newly-formed left-wing coalition rally, urging a democratic and social upsurge to counter the National Rally's momentum. They warn of extreme-right policies detrimental to marginalized communities globally.

Left-wing parties, setting aside international conflict differences, coalesce to thwart the National Rally, which polls predict will lead in the first parliamentary election round.

President Macron, despite retaining foreign and defense powers, faces a weakened presidency if the National Rally prevails, potentially elevating their young leader, Jordan Bardella, to prime minister, with control over domestic and economic policies.

The stakes are high; the outcome could redefine France's political landscape and echo internationally.
