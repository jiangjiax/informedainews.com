On June 14, 2024, at the Shanghai International Film Festival, Shanghai Film Group announced a series of new film projects, including the animated film "Summer of the Little Demon: Once Upon a Time There Was a Rolling Mountain," scheduled for release in the summer of 2025. This film is part of the "Qitan Universe" series and is a spin-off of the popular "Chinese Qitan" animated series from 2023, telling the adventure story of the character "Little Pig Demon." The creative team maintained consistency with the previous works to ensure the continuity of the narrative.

Additionally, the group announced projects such as "A Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains" (adapted from Sun Ganlu's novel) and "Snow Dragon" (based on the real rescue mission of China's "Snow Dragon" in the Antarctic). These films aim to blend commercial appeal with artistic value, utilizing advanced technologies like artificial intelligence to enhance production quality.

Meanwhile, Shanghai Film Group launched the Shanghai Film Art Center, a historic building renovation project located in Shanghai, marking a new cultural landmark. The center's opening featured performances by actor Huang Bo and dancer Gao Yanjinzi.

The group also revealed plans for collaborations across various fields including technology, entertainment, and gaming, aiming to enrich the film experience and expand its IP influence. These initiatives reflect a strategic shift towards the integration of film with multiple industries, aiming to revitalize the cultural landscape and attract a broader audience.
