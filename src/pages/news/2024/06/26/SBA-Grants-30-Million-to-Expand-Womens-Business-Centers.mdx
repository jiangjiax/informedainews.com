The Small Business Administration (SBA) is awarding $30 million to Women's Business Centers (WBCs) to enhance their outreach. This initiative involves establishing a new center in the U.S. Virgin Islands and enhancing virtual support services. The grants are specifically aimed at areas such as government contracting, child care services, and underserved regions. With 152 centers currently operating across the U.S. and Puerto Rico, WBCs provide essential support to women entrepreneurs. This strategic move not only expands access to entrepreneurial resources for women but also focuses on sectors critical to societal needs, such as child care, potentially significantly increasing economic participation and innovation.
