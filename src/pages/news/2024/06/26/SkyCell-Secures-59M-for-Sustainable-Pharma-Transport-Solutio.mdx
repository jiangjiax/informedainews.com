SkyCell, a Swiss startup, has raised $59 million in its Series D round, bringing the total to $116 million. This funding will support its expansion in Asia and the U.S., focusing on smart containers for pharmaceutical transport. These containers leverage machine learning to maintain optimal conditions for temperature-sensitive drugs, reducing spoilage and emissions.

Established in 2012, SkyCell transitioned from designing storage facilities to developing transport solutions for pharmaceutical giants. Its growth has been impressive, with a 50% annual increase, managing $2.5 billion in pharmaceutical products monthly. The company's containers are lighter and more efficient, reducing CO2 emissions by 50%.

The global drive for decarbonization aligns with SkyCell's mission, as pharmaceutical companies aim to decrease their 4.4% contribution to global emissions. CEO Richard Ettl points out that adopting green practices can cost a pharma company about 2% of its sales, but the savings from efficient transport are substantial.

SkyCell's technology goes beyond transport, with components like smart thermometers being utilized in pharmaceutical storage environments. The company's integrated hardware and software solutions position it as a pivotal player in pharmaceutical logistics, addressing the crucial need for secure and sustainable drug delivery.
