Southern California Edison supports the largest U.S. geothermal project, poised to energize 400,000 homes. Fervo Energy, leveraging oil industry technology, drills in Utah to harness Earth's heat. This clean electricity significantly reduces dependence on fossil fuels, vital for decarbonization efforts.

Geothermal energy, previously constrained by scarce hot water reservoirs, now grows with advanced drilling techniques. The U.S., a frontrunner in this sector, recognizes the potential for broader implementation. Fervo's innovations, including horizontal drilling, already supply Nevada with carbon-free power.

California targets 2026 for geothermal power delivery, reinforcing its commitment to zero-carbon electricity. Geothermal's consistent output complements fluctuating wind and solar, ensuring dependable clean energy.

This milestone highlights a transition towards scalable, sustainable power solutions, essential in our fight against climate change.
