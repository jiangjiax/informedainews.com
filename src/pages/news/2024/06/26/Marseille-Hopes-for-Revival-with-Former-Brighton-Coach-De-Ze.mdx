Marseille, a once-dominant French soccer club, has struggled since 2016 under American owner Frank McCourt. The team, plagued by instability and frequent coaching changes, now eyes a revival with Roberto De Zerbi, former Brighton coach, set to take the helm. De Zerbi's impressive stint at Brighton, including a historic sixth-place finish and a UEFA Europa League last 16 berth, offers hope for Marseille's resurgence.
