Durian, once an inexpensive fruit in Southeast Asia, now commands high prices. China's growing appetite for this pungent fruit has significantly transformed local economies. Exports to China skyrocketed from $550 million in 2017 to $6.7 billion last year.

Eric Chan, a former satellite coder, profited immensely by selling durian paste, with his initial investment growing nearly 50-fold. Farmers, who were once impoverished, are now able to renovate their homes and send their children to universities overseas.

Thailand is the leading exporter of durian, followed by Malaysia and Vietnam. The cultivation area for durian in Thailand has doubled, and forests in Malaysia are being cleared to make way for new plantations.

Chinese investment has also extended into durian logistics in Thailand, controlling approximately 70% of the wholesale market, which raises concerns among local Thai businesses.

Durian, which is both expensive and deeply ingrained in local cultures, faces a paradox: while exports are booming, rising prices are frustrating local consumers. What was once a plentiful fruit is now considered a luxury.

Transporting durian to China presents challenges due to its strong odor, leading to innovative solutions such as freezing the fruit before shipping.
