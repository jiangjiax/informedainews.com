On June 25, 2024, the Chang'e-6 return capsule successfully landed in the Siziwang Banner of Inner Mongolia, marking the complete success of China's first lunar far side sample return mission. This mission not only achieved the world's first lunar far side sampling but also set several Chinese firsts: unfurling the national flag on the lunar far side, leaving an imprint of the Chinese character "中", and capturing a full-body color standard photo.

Chang'e-6 underwent a series of complex space operations, including orbit correction, near-moon braking, lunar orbit descent, and powered descent, ultimately achieving precise landing and sampling in the pre-selected area of the South Pole-Aitken Basin on the lunar far side. During the return process, the return capsule executed two aerodynamic decelerations, ultimately safely returning to Earth.

The success of this mission not only showcases China's technological prowess in deep space exploration but also lays the foundation for future lunar scientific research and international cooperation. The scientific instruments carried by Chang'e-6 will continue to collect valuable data on the Moon and deep space in the future, advancing humanity's understanding of the universe.
