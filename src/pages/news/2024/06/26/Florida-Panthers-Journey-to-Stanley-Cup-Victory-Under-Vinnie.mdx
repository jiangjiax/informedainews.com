Vinnie Viola, founder of Virtu Financial, acquired the Florida Panthers for $250 million in 2013 with the aim of transforming the faltering team into Stanley Cup champions. Eleven years later, under the leadership of captain Aleksander Barkov, the team celebrated its victory with the Cup, signifying a remarkable transformation. Central to this success was General Manager Bill Zito, whose strategic moves, including the acquisition of forward Matthew Tkachuk, significantly reshaped the team's dynamics.

The Panthers' on-ice achievements have substantially increased revenue. Attendance has surged by 25.7%, ticket revenues have increased by 50%, and corporate sponsorships have skyrocketed by 123.8% since the 2021-22 season.

Viola's steadfast commitment and visionary leadership have propelled the Panthers from obscurity to prominence, demonstrating that strategic investment and effective leadership can yield extraordinary outcomes.
