Meta's Threads, a social platform, has expanded its presence into the fediverseâ€”a network of interconnected servers utilizing the ActivityPub protocol. Initially tested in beta across the U.S., Canada, and Japan, this feature is now accessible to Threads users aged 18 and over in more than 100 countries.

Meta is dedicated to clarifying the fediverse, providing users with insights into its workings and advantages. Threads users can now disseminate content across platforms such as Mastodon, observe likes and replies originating from the fediverse, although direct replies are currently not supported.

During this beta phase, only top-level posts and self-replies are eligible for federation, with other post formats like polls being excluded. To utilize this feature, users need to activate "Fediverse Sharing (Beta)" within their Account Settings.

Meta's approach highlights a pledge to cultivate a secure, diverse, and interoperable community within the fediverse, with the goal of boosting content visibility and community interaction. Given Threads' existing user base of over 150 million monthly active users, this integration has the potential to substantially increase the fediverse's user population.
