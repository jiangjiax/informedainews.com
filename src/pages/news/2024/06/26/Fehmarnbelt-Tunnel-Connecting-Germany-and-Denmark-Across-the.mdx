The Fehmarnbelt Tunnel, currently under construction, spans 18 kilometers across the Baltic Sea, linking Germany and Denmark. This monumental project is set to become the world's longest and deepest immersed tunnel, designed to accommodate both road and rail traffic. With a budget of $12 billion, this engineering marvel will transform a 45-minute ferry journey into a mere 10-minute drive or a 7-minute train ride. Comprising 79 standard and 10 special segments, each of significant size, these components are pre-fabricated on land before being floated out and submerged. Slated for completion in 2029, the tunnel is expected to provide a century of service, fostering a closer connection between Scandinavia and Europe than ever before.
