Hong Kong Disneyland is on track to record its first profit in ten years, thanks to a significant increase in international tourists and the recent launch of a "Frozen" themed zone. Despite previous challenges competing with mainland Chinese parks, the resort saw its revenue triple last year, substantially reducing its losses. As a joint venture with the Hong Kong government, the park has plans for further expansion.
