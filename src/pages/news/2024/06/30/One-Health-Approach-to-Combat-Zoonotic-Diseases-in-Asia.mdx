Zoonotic diseases, which are those that can jump from animals to humans, are on the rise in Asia. Factors such as population growth, deforestation, and climate change are driving this trend. Recent examples include the H5N1 and H5N6 strains of bird flu, which have affected poultry across several Asian countries.

The "One Health" approach, which integrates human, animal, and environmental health, is crucial. It necessitates collaboration across various sectors and disciplines. Livestock health is particularly important, given its role in food security and livelihoods for many in Asia.

Heifer International's Community Agrovet Entrepreneurs (CAVE) program trains local individuals to manage animal health. This model not only improves livestock care but also empowers women and enhances community awareness of health interconnections.

Rajni Hembran, a CAVE participant in India, provides on-site animal care, boosting local livestock health and productivity. Her work exemplifies the practical benefits of the One Health approach at the grassroots level.

The CAVE model effectively addresses multiple issues: reducing disease transmission, educating communities, improving livestock productivity, and promoting women's leadership and economic empowerment.
