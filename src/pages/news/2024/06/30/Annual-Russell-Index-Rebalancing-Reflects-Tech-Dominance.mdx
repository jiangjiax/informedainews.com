On June 28, the Russell indices—including Russell 1000, 2000, and 3000—underwent their annual rebalancing. This process, managed by FTSE Russell, adjusts the indices' components to mirror current market conditions. It's based on factors like market cap and liquidity.

This event is significant; about $10.5 trillion follows these indices. Traders and fund managers adjust their portfolios to align with the updated indices, leading to heavy trading volumes, especially near market close.

This year, Nasdaq's closing cross system handled $953 billion in trades, a record. The rebalance highlighted tech's dominance. The top ten companies in Russell 1000 now hold 34.3% of the index, the highest in 40 years. Microsoft tops the list, followed by Nvidia and Amazon. Tech's overall weight in the index is also at a historic high of 36.1%.

FTSE Russell's CEO, Fiona Bassett, noted the shift reflects a tech-centric economic restructuring in the U.S. The Russell 2000, meanwhile, leans heavily towards healthcare, with 41 new healthcare companies added.
