Crypto platforms must report transactions to the IRS starting in 2026. This move, part of the Biden Administration's Infrastructure Act, aims to standardize tax reporting and combat evasion. Decentralized platforms, which don't hold assets, are exempt. The IRS plans separate regulations for them.

**Explanation:**
- **Crypto platforms:** Services like Coinbase where users buy and sell cryptocurrencies.
- **Decentralized platforms:** Systems where transactions occur directly between users, without a central authority holding assets.
