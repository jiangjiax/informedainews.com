A 428-year-old document, hidden in the National Archives, has revealed Elizabeth I's spy network. Robert Cecil, her spymaster, organized this network to gather intelligence on European monarchs. Historian Stephen Alford discovered the document, titled "The names of the Intelligencers," and has spent years reconstructing Cecil's espionage files.

Cecil's network was extensive, involving over 20 spies in various European cities. These spies were mostly international merchants, chosen for their travel abilities, language skills, and existing networks. Each spy sent coded reports to Cecil, who decrypted them using individual ciphers.

Alford believes this network was the first properly organized secret service in England. Cecil's meticulous organization and funding allowed him to operate effectively, providing accurate information rather than mere gossip. This discovery sheds new light on Elizabethan espionage and Cecil's role in it.
