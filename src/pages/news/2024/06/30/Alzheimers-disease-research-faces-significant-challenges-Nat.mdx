Research on Alzheimer's disease has encountered a significant setback. A Nature paper cited nearly 2500 times, due to fabrication, faces retraction and could have misled research for up to 18 years. Two experts, Chen Yelin and Leng Lige, discuss the disease's pathogenesis and the latest research progress. Chen Yelin focuses on neurobiology and chemical biology, while Leng Lige studies Alzheimer's disease from the perspective of altered neural cell metabolic networks.

Alzheimer's disease, commonly known as senile dementia, primarily affects memory and cognitive functions. Its pathogenesis is complex, involving genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Treatment options include medications and non-pharmacological interventions, but the development of new drugs faces numerous challenges.

The falsifiability of scientific research is its core characteristic, and clinical trials and new drug development are crucial steps in validating hypotheses. Alzheimer's disease not only affects memory but can also lead to emotional and behavioral issues. Care for patients requires patience and specialized knowledge.

Screening and early diagnosis are key to prevention and treatment. Alzheimer's disease could become the next major disease affecting human lifespan.
