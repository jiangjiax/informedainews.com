Associated Press, founded in 1846, faces a crisis in local news. Free online sites threaten traditional outlets. AP plans a sister organization to seek grants, aiming to bolster local reporting. Daisy Veerasingham, AP's CEO, cites a decline in local journalists from 75,000 to 31,000 since 2000. Over half of U.S. counties lack local news outlets. AP's goal: new products and services to aid the industry.
