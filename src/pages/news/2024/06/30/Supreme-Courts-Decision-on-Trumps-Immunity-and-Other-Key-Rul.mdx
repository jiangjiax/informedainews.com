The Supreme Court concluded a busy term, ruling on issues such as abortion, guns, environment, health, opioids, securities fraud, and homelessness. The major question now is: Will Trump be immune from prosecution for his involvement in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot?

The court's decision, anticipated in early July, is likely to postpone any trial until after the November election. This timing aligns with Trump's legal team's strategy, who have sought delays in all four criminal cases against him.

Critics contend that the court's deliberate pace provides Trump with "immunity by delay." A federal appeals court previously dismissed his immunity claim, but the Supreme Court has agreed to review his appeal.

The court also addresses state laws restricting social media content regulation, in response to conservative allegations of liberal bias and censorship.

In a different action, the justices dismissed a lawsuit against the Biden administration, which accused it of exerting improper pressure on social media to remove controversial posts.
