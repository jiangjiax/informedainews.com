Beryl, a Category 1 hurricane, formed farthest east in the Atlantic in June, breaking a 1933 record. It's expected to intensify into a major storm, Category 3 or higher, before hitting Barbados. Hurricane warnings are in place for several Caribbean islands.

The storm's rapid intensification is attributed to record-high ocean heat content. Beryl is the strongest June tropical storm on record in this region.

Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley urged readiness, noting the island's hosting of the Twenty20 World Cup cricket final. Some fans are altering travel plans to avoid the storm.

St. Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves prepared shelters and extended business hours to accommodate storm preparations.

Beryl is the second named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, predicted to be busy. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecasts 17 to 25 named storms, with up to 13 hurricanes and four major ones.

Rain, high surf, and storm surges are expected in affected areas. Caribbean leaders are also monitoring a cluster of thunderstorms following Beryl's path.
