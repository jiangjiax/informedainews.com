Professor Du Guanglong's team at South China University of Technology has developed a robotic ultrasound scanning system for thyroid nodule detection. This system integrates artificial intelligence to perform high-quality ultrasound scans automatically without human assistance.

The system comprises components such as a six-degree-of-freedom UR3 robotic arm and a linear ultrasound probe, which can automatically approach the neck, navigate, and detect nodules. The team has validated the system's accuracy and reliability through clinical tests.

During a test, a team member unexpectedly discovered a malignant thyroid tumor, prompting him to change his lifestyle, undergo active treatment, and eventually regain his health. This experience underscores the importance of early detection.

The system is expected to address the shortage of ultrasound services in primary healthcare settings, enhance diagnostic accuracy and consistency, and drive innovation and development in related technologies.

The team plans to conduct clinical validation in more medical institutions, collect data, optimize the system, and ensure its broad applicability and reliability.
