Lithium, a soft metal, fuels the battery boom. Used in laptops, phones, and electric cars, it's crucial for clean energy goals. Mined from brines or hard rocks, its reserves are vast but concentrated. Chile leads with 9.3 million tons, followed by Australia and Argentina. Bolivia tops all with 21 million tons. The U.S. holds third place globally.

Lithium resources dictate the electric future. Control over these reserves shapes the industry's direction. The race for lithium underscores the global push towards sustainability.
