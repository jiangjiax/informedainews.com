Becka Robbins operates "Books Not Bans" from Fabulosa Books in San Francisco's Castro District. She ships LGBTQ+ books to states that have banned them. Robbins utilizes customer donations to dispatch books that explore queer history, sexuality, and romance. From July 2022 to June 2023, over 40% of book bans occurred in Florida, with Texas and Missouri following closely.

Book bans have reached unprecedented levels, impacting both school and public libraries. PEN America notes that 30% of banned books feature characters of color or address race, and another 30% contain LGBTQ+ themes. Conservative groups such as Moms for Liberty advocate for these bans, citing sexually explicit content, although 38% of their objections relate to LGBTQ+ themes.

So far, Robbins has distributed 740 books, each valued between $300 and $400. At the Rose Dynasty Center in Lakeland, Florida, these donated books have found a place on the shelves. Jason DeShazo, a drag queen who manages the center, strives to offer a safe haven and a collection of banned books.

Robbins prefers to send young adult queer romances, a genre that is expanding and reflecting broader discussions about LGBTQ+ topics. These books depict ordinary kids—ordinary people who happen to be queer—experiencing love and happiness.
