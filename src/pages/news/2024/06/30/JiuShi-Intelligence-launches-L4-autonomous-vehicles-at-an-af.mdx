JiuShi Intelligence, a rising star in Suzhou, has risen to prominence in just three years. They have launched L4-level autonomous vehicles, starting at a price of 39,800 RMB, with functions covering express delivery, fresh produce, and food delivery. Their new product launch sold out half a year's production capacity within an hour.

Their product line is diverse, ranging from the Z2 to the Z10, with cargo spaces from 2m³ to 10m³, all at affordable prices. The Z5 model has been upgraded with enhanced appearance, features, and algorithms, priced at 49,800 RMB. The hardware is robust, featuring dual NVIDIA Orin chips with a computing power of 512 TOPS, equipped with multiple sensors, and a perception range exceeding 300 meters.

The software algorithms have been upgraded with the ZOE 2.0 architecture, capable of operating in harsh weather conditions. Their business model is flexible, combining direct operations with dealers, offering software subscription services, and providing L4-level autonomous driving.

The founder, Kong Qi, has backgrounds from Baidu and JD.com, and is a tech expert. The JiuShi team has rich practical experience, having firsthand experience in courier services, and a deep understanding of industry pain points.

The industry is recovering, with the cost of unmanned delivery decreasing, leading to significant cost reductions for customers and promising profitability for suppliers. JiuShi Intelligence is leading the industry, with a bright future ahead.
