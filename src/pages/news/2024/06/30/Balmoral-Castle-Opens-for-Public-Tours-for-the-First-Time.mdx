Balmoral Castle, a royal retreat since 1852, opens to public tours for the first time. Visitors explore rooms like the entrance hall, library, and drawing room, now restored to Queen Victoria's original style by King Charles. Tickets, including options with afternoon tea, sold out quickly. The castle, described as "homely," features art by Sir Edwin Henry Landseer and items like a chauffeur's whistle and a dinner gong from HMS Temeraire.
