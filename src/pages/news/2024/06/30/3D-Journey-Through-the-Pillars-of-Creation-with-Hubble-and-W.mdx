NASA's latest visualization merges data from Hubble and James Webb telescopes, offering a 3D journey through the iconic "Pillars of Creation" in the Eagle Nebula. This composite image combines Hubble's visible light views with Webb's infrared, revealing detailed structures within these star-forming clouds.

The pillars, composed of cold hydrogen and dust, are eroded by nearby stars' winds and UV radiation. They extend over three light-years, with embryonic stars embedded within. The visualization allows viewers to experience these structures in three dimensions, contrasting their appearances in different wavelengths.

This project, led by the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), enhances understanding of how multiple telescopes observe the same celestial bodies. It also provides a comprehensive view of star formation stages, from embedded protostars to newly formed stars ejecting material.

In addition to the video, a 3D printed model of the pillars is available, allowing tactile exploration of these cosmic structures. This initiative, part of NASA's Universe of Learning program, aims to engage the public with NASA's astrophysics missions, fostering a deeper appreciation of the universe.
