U.S., Europe, and Arab mediators urge Hezbollah to halt attacks on Israel, fearing a broader Middle East war. Hezbollah, stronger than Hamas, faces warnings not to challenge Israel's military might. The group should not rely on U.S. intervention to deter Israel if it invades Lebanon.

Recent strikes between Israel and Hezbollah have plateaued, but tensions remain high. The U.S. has deployed an amphibious assault ship to the region to deter conflict. Israel and Hezbollah possess significant firepower, capable of causing heavy casualties.

U.N. humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths describes a potential war as "apocalyptic." Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warns of catastrophic consequences for Lebanon. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant emphasizes readiness for various scenarios.

Iran-allied militias in the region could escalate hostilities. Iran, focused on domestic politics, views Hezbollah as a strategic partner. The U.S. may intervene if Israel faces serious threats.

Hezbollah's arsenal includes an estimated 150,000 rockets and missiles. Israeli leaders threaten Gaza-like devastation on Lebanon if war erupts. Diplomatic efforts by the U.S., France, and other European nations aim to reduce tensions.

White House officials support Israel's right to defend itself but caution against opening a second front. They acknowledge the possibility of a major escalation.
