Amazon Games is set to release a new installment of "Tomb Raider," unrelated to the live-action series on Prime Video. Vice President Hartman emphasizes the importance of cross-media but notes the independence of the game and the series. He cites Marvel's "Spider-Man" as an example to illustrate brand consistency. The release dates for the "Tomb Raider" game and live-action series are yet to be determined, while Netflix's animated series "Legend of Lara" is scheduled to premiere on October 10th.

Cross-media franchise: Refers to the development and promotion of the same brand across different media formats such as games, movies, and series.
