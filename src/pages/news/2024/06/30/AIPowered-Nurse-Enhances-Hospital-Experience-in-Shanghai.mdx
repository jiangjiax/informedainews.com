Shanghai First People's Hospital has adopted Alipay's "AI Medical Assistant" to launch the first voice-interactive "AI Companion - Gongji Xiao Yi" based on a large model. Patients can ask questions via Alipay, such as "What department should I go to for dry eyes?", and receive medical advice and registration services. The AI Companion can also provide waiting information and in-hospital navigation to improve the medical experience.
