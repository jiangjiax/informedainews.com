In 2007, Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone. Development began in 2005 under strict secrecy. The device was met with amazement upon launch but reached stores months later.

Apple partnered with Cingular Wireless (now AT&T) for the iPhone's network. Development costs approached $1.5 billion. Apple maintained full control over both hardware and software.

Prior to release, Jobs switched the screen from plastic to glass after scratching the prototype. Foxconn took over production.

The iPhone debuted at $499 for 4GB and $599 for 8GB. Despite the high price, demand soared. Stores sold out within hours. Theft risks prompted off-duty police to guard shops.

In the first week, Apple sold 270,000 iPhones. By the 74th day, sales reached one million. By October 2007, it ranked fourth in U.S. phone sales.

In 2008, Apple introduced a 16GB model at $499. The original models were phased out later that year, having sold over six million units.

The first iPhone laid the groundwork for Apple's smartphone dominance. The upcoming iPhone 16 promises advancements beyond the original's reach. Without that first iPhone, none of this would exist.
