Sports fans are now favoring social media clips over live TV broadcasts of the Olympics. This change is detrimental to the International Olympic Committee, which relies on broadcast rights for 60% of its revenue.

TV viewership has declined: 3.05 billion people watched the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, a decrease from 3.6 billion in London 2012. Meanwhile, internet clips have seen a surge: 28 billion views in Tokyo, up from 1.9 billion in London.

Young viewers, such as a Japanese individual in their twenties, opt for highlights instead of live TV. Since 1984, IOC broadcast revenues have increased tenfold, but now they face a potential decline.

Pay-per-view and high rights fees are reducing traditional TV audiences. Free Olympic broadcasts are straining TV channels, resulting in losses.

The 2024 Paris Olympics poses challenges for Japanese broadcasters due to time differences and the yen's depreciation.

TV sports once brought viewers together, but now smartphones are fragmenting the audience. Youth TV sports viewership and participation in sports clubs have decreased.

Olympics organizers are looking at e-sports, but financial interests could further destabilize the Games.
