Brazil’s Pantanal, the world’s largest tropical wetlands, is burning. Fires typically flare from July to September, but June saw a record 2,500 blazes, more than six times the number in June 2020. Environment Minister Marina Silva calls it one of the worst situations ever seen.

The Pantanal, a biodiversity hotspot, is drying up. The Paraguay River basin is experiencing severe water scarcity. Fires are devouring the flora and charred animals. Silva attributes the fires to human activity, climate change, and prolonged effects of El Nino and La Nina phenomena.

The federal government has deployed 285 agents and 82 National Guard members to support local fire brigades. Fire committees, including government branches and environmental nonprofits, discuss fire management and train local communities in prevention and early response.

Manuel Garcia da Silva, head of a fire brigade, says most fires are underground, burning through nearly a meter of material under the soil. His brigade spends seven hours a day fighting fires.

Conditions are more severe than in 2020. Expectations for extreme drought in August and September are causing alarm. Renata Libonati, a meteorology professor, says the vegetation is under stress, predisposed to burning. Since January, fires have destroyed over 688,000 hectares.

Most fires are likely human-caused. Minister Silva says 85% originate in private properties. Traditional farmers use fire to manage pasture areas, despite the ban.

Environmental organizations had warned of the danger long before the fires. A study found that dry and semi-arid areas have expanded across Brazil over the past 30 years. The Pantanal has dried up most since 1985.
