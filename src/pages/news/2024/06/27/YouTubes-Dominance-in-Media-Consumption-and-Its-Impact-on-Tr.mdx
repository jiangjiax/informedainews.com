YouTube, now a 20-year-old platform, has emerged as a dominant force in media consumption, surpassing traditional and streaming competitors. In May, it accounted for 9.7% of all TV viewership in the U.S., according to Nielsen, outpacing Netflix's 7.6%.

Media giants like Netflix, Disney, and Warner Bros. Discovery are navigating YouTube's dual role: a potential ally and a formidable threat. Some see it as a complementary platform, while others view it as a competitor that is eroding viewership and cultural relevance from traditional entertainment.

Disney, in particular, is closely observing YouTube due to its influence on younger audiences. The company is exploring the integration of user-generated content into Disney+ and considering more full episodes of Disney+ and Hulu series on YouTube to engage non-subscribers.

YouTube's success is highlighted by its advertising revenue, which hit $31.5 billion in 2023, marking a substantial increase from previous years. Analysts value it at $400 billion, surpassing major media conglomerates.

The challenge for traditional media is to adapt to a landscape where user-generated content and social media are central to audience engagement. The strategy moving forward involves a careful balance between utilizing YouTube's reach and safeguarding core business models.
