A Kremlin-linked disinformation network has amplified a video titled "Bye, Bye Biden," which portrays President Joe Biden as senile and unfit for office. This video, which has been viewed over 5 million times on platform X, shows Biden in a diaper, taking medication, and prioritizing migrants over US citizens. Created by Little Bug, a group that mimics a Russian band, the video employs AI to manipulate actors to resemble Biden, Trump, and a Russian singer.

Expert analysis indicates the use of inconsistent deepfake technology, suggesting a rushed creation. The audio is confirmed to be AI-generated, with facial manipulation also likely. Promoted by Doppelganger, a network identified by Antibot4Navalny, the video quickly spread through thousands of posts in multiple languages, facilitated by generative AI.

This manipulation highlights the growing threat of AI in disinformation campaigns, targeting public perception with unprecedented speed and reach.
