Sensi.AI, established by Romi Gubes in 2019, has secured $31 million in a Series B funding round led by Insight Partners and Zeev Ventures. The company employs audio AI to monitor seniors within their homes, catering to a rising trend among the elderly to age in place. Unlike conventional home care services that operate only during specific hours, Sensi.AI offers continuous 24/7 monitoring, detecting both emergencies and nuanced health changes and emotional well-being.

The technology deploys audio pods throughout the home to analyze sounds for deviations from typical patterns. This method provides a thorough assessment of the senior's condition, alerting caregivers to both critical and non-critical health concerns. Sensi.AI asserts it can identify over 100 insights regarding the well-being of seniors, backed by a clinical care team.

Currently, over 80% of the largest U.S. homecare networks integrate Sensi.AI, and the company has seen a tripling of revenue over the past three years. With fresh funding and advancements in generative AI, Sensi.AI intends to broaden its services globally, utilizing language models to support international operations.
