Pinterest adapts for Gen Z, now enabling users to transform their boards into shareable videos for Instagram and TikTok. This shift capitalizes on the video-centric preferences of younger users, mirroring the success of TikTok's video-sharing culture.

Previously, Pinterest users manually shared their boards on TikTok, using screenshots or green screen effects. This "mecore" trend, emphasizing personal style and curated collections, has surged in popularity, with related searches on Pinterest skyrocketing by 565% annually.

The new feature allows seamless video creation from boards, complete with links that redirect viewers back to the full Pinterest board. This not only enhances creative expression but also strategically drives traffic back to Pinterest, leveraging the viral potential of TikTok and Instagram.

Pinterest's collaboration with artists like Avril Lavigne and Tierra Whack showcases the feature's potential for creative and promotional uses. By tapping into Gen Z's engagement and feedback, Pinterest aims to strengthen its appeal and utility among this key demographic.
