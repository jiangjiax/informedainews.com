A team from South China University of Technology, led by Professor Du Guanglong, has developed a robotic ultrasound system for detecting thyroid nodules. This system, integrating artificial intelligence, performs high-quality scans without human assistance. It utilizes a deep learning network for segmenting thyroid lobes and nodules, and for locating the thyroid.

Equipped with a six-degree-of-freedom UR3 arm and a linear ultrasound probe, the robot autonomously navigates the neck and visualizes nodules from various angles. Clinical tests have demonstrated its effectiveness, outperforming manual methods. Notably, a team member discovered his own thyroid cancer during a test, highlighting the system's potential for early detection and health management.

This innovation is set to enhance diagnostic accuracy and timeliness in primary healthcare, addressing the scarcity of skilled ultrasound operators. It also facilitates remote diagnostics, promoting equitable distribution of medical resources and reducing human error.

The team plans further clinical validation across diverse patient groups and will refine the system based on user feedback. This advancement not only improves healthcare delivery but also drives innovation in robotics and medical imaging.
