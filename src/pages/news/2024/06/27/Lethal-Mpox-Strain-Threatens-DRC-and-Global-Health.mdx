A lethal strain of mpox, a virus similar to smallpox, is devastating the Democratic Republic of the Congo, especially among children and pregnant women. This mutated version, stemming from clade I, shows a higher mortality rate than previous outbreaks, with transmission happening through both sexual and non-sexual contact.

The outbreak, focused in Kamituga, South Kivu, is feared to be the precursor to a broader crisis. Unlike the 2022 outbreak caused by clade II, which was managed with vaccines and treatments, the current strain's virulence and the scarcity of medical resources in the DRC present a substantial threat.

Given South Kivu's adjacency to several countries and regular cross-border activity, the possibility of international spread is concerning. Scientists and medical professionals stress the urgency of preparedness and support for local responses to avert a global health disaster.
