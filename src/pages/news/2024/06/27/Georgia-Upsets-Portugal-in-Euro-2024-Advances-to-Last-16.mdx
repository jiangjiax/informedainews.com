Georgia, a newcomer to major tournaments, stunned Portugal with a 2-0 victory, securing their spot in the last 16 of Euro 2024. Khvicha Kvaratskhelia's early goal and Georges Mikautadze's penalty sealed the historic win. Despite Portugal's dominance in possession and shots, Georgia's tactical discipline and Kvaratskhelia's skill proved decisive.

The match was a classic underdog triumph, reminiscent of Wales in 2016 or Iceland's upset over England. Georgia's manager, Willy Sagnol, aptly described it as David versus Goliath. Portugal, already through to the next round, fielded a heavily rotated team, with Cristiano Ronaldo the sole regular starter. His frustration, evident in a petulant display, contrasted sharply with Georgia's spirited performance.

This victory, a testament to Georgia's resilience and tactical acumen, will be celebrated long after the tournament. Their next challenge: Spain in the last 16.
