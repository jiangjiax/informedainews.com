Inflation gnaws at American wallets, prompting widespread concern. A CNET survey reveals 93% of Americans fret over rising costs, with 37% extremely worried. This anxiety drives cutbacks: 53% reduce nonessential spending, while 16% lean on credit to cover essentials.

Generational impacts vary. Gen X and Boomers lead in concern and spending cuts. Millennials delay major purchases and savings, while Gen Z dips into savings and credit. Grocery prices shock most, followed by gas, dining, utilities, and clothing.

Inflation squeezes household budgets, complicating adherence to financial plans. It delays long-term goals and debt repayment, with many resorting to borrowing to meet daily needs.

In this economic climate, caution and adaptability are key. The survey underscores a collective struggle to balance present needs against future financial health.
