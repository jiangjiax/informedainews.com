In Brazil, a study conducted by the University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP) has revealed alarming levels of mold toxins in common household foods such as flour and rice. These toxins, which are known to cause cancer and disrupt hormonal balance, pose significant risks, especially to children and teenagers. The research, supported by FAPESP and published in "Food Research International," represents the first application of biomarkers to evaluate these dietary risks in Brazil.

The study identified six key toxins: AFs (aflatoxins), FBs (fumonisins), ZEN (zearalenone), T-2 (T-2 toxin), DON (deoxynivalenol), and OTA (ochratoxin A), all of which have potential carcinogenic, immunosuppressive, or endocrine-disrupting effects. Notably, levels of FBs, ZEN, and DON surpassed safety thresholds. Carlos Augusto Fernandes de Oliveira, the lead researcher, emphasized the extreme danger posed by aflatoxin B1, a potent natural carcinogen identified as early as the 1960s.

This research highlights the critical importance of proper food storage, particularly in dry conditions to prevent mold growth and contamination. The second phase of the study is currently underway, involving the analysis of urine samples from affected children and teenagers to better assess toxin exposure and its health implications.

Mold toxins, unlike some chemicals, do not accumulate in the body but continue to cause progressive harm, making early detection and prevention essential, particularly for young individuals who are more vulnerable to their detrimental effects.
