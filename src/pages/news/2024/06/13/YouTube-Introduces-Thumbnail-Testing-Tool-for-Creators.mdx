YouTube's new "Thumbnail Test & Compare" tool enables creators to test three video thumbnails for performance. Results, based on watch time share, help identify the most engaging preview image. Initially limited, this feature is now widely accessible, assisting creators in attracting viewers amidst increasing competition. Testing duration varies, influenced by impressions and thumbnail differences. Available for various content types, excluding private or mature/kids-rated videos. Accessible on desktop, with mobile support in development.
