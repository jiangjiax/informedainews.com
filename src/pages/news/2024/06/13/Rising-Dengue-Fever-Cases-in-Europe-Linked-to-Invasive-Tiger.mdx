Invasive tiger mosquitoes, thriving in Europe's warming climate, are driving a rise in dengue fever. Found in 13 EU countries, these pests spread diseases like dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. Climate change and international travel exacerbate the risk.

Paris, set to host the Olympics, is on alert. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) urges removal of stagnant water and use of repellents and nets. Locally-acquired infections are climbing, mirroring global trends where dengue is endemic.

As Europe adapts to this new threat, vigilance and prevention are key. The continent faces a dual challenge: managing imported cases and stemming local outbreaks. Climate and travel patterns converge, heightening the urgency for robust surveillance and public awareness.
