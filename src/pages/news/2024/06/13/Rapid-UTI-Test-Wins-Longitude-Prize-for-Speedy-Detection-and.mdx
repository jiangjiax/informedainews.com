A rapid UTI test, capable of identifying treatment in 45 minutes, has won the £8m Longitude prize. Developed by Sysmex Astrego, this test utilizes a urine sample to detect bacterial infection within 15 minutes and recommends an appropriate antibiotic within 45 minutes. In contrast, traditional lab tests typically take two to three days.

The significance of this test is profound. It tackles the critical issue of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), where antibiotics gradually lose their effectiveness. AMR is currently responsible for nearly 1.3 million deaths each year and is projected to increase to 10 million by 2050.

Presently, doctors frequently prescribe antibiotics based on symptoms, which can lead to overuse and increased resistance. This new test enables precise antibiotic prescription, potentially reducing resistance and enhancing patient care.

Although currently priced at £25 per cartridge, the test has the potential to become more affordable with increased production and adoption by the public sector. This could revolutionize UTI treatment worldwide, especially in resource-limited settings.

The Longitude prize winner not only represents a technological breakthrough but also signals a strategic shift in antibiotic management, moving from 'just-in-case' prescribing to targeted, effective treatment.
