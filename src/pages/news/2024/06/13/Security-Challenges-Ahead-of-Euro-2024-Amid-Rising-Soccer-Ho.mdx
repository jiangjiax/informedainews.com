Violence escalates around soccer, casting a shadow over Euro 2024 in Germany. Police brace for unprecedented deployment, with 22,000 officers daily, no vacations allowed. Cross-border alliances among hooligans complicate security. High-risk games, like England vs. Serbia, pose significant threats. German cities, especially those in the Rhine-Ruhr region, are potential battlegrounds. Police confrontations often result in injuries, highlighting the challenge of maintaining order amidst organized, violent fan groups. The tournament's scale and the increasing sophistication of hooligan networks make Euro 2024 a formidable security challenge.
