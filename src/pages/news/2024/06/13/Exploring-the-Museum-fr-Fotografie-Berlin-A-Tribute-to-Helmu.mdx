Museum für Fotografie Berlin: A hidden gem amidst the city's grand museums. Helmut Newton's legacy dominates, his provocative images challenging perceptions of femininity. The museum, once an officer's casino, now houses Newton's vast estate, including his Monaco apartment and favored cameras.

Beyond Newton, temporary exhibitions rotate, showcasing photography's evolution through the lens of Condé Nast. These displays offer a visual narrative of the 20th century, featuring iconic figures and moments captured by renowned photographers.

Adjacent to C/O Berlin and the Leica Store, the area is a haven for photography enthusiasts. Despite Berlin's transformation into a tourist hotspot, the Museum für Fotografie remains a compelling reason to visit, offering a deep dive into the art and impact of photography.
