China's longest solar-powered irrigation project, stretching 522 kilometers across the desert, has produced over 5 million kilowatt-hours of clean energy. This endeavor supports 3,100 hectares of ecological forest and displaces diesel power, substantially cutting carbon emissions. Comprising 86 solar stations with storage capabilities for uninterrupted operation, the project also utilizes grass grids to secure shifting sands. Despite challenging desert conditions, the region is exhibiting signs of ecological rejuvenation.
