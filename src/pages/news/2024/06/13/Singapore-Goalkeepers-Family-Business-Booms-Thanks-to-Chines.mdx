In the 2026 World Cup qualifiers, Singapore's goalkeeper, Sani, played a pivotal role in China's advancement by making crucial saves against Thailand. Following the match, his family's coconut rice stall in Singapore experienced a significant increase in Chinese customers, with WeChat Pay transactions surging tenfold. The stall, known as Dapur Hassan, transformed into a popular destination, attracting fans who even "dined" remotely through digital payments. This phenomenon highlights how the intersection of sports and commerce can significantly boost local businesses and demonstrates the far-reaching impact of digital payment platforms.
