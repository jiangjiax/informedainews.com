California is at the forefront, mandating that all new vehicles be zero-emission by 2035. This policy, enacted in August 2022, seeks to phase out gasoline-powered cars not through confiscation but by limiting sales to electric vehicles and certain plug-in hybrids. The initiative is not solely about improving air quality but also about reducing broader environmental impacts.

Inspired by California, eleven other states—Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington—have declared similar bans on the sale of new gasoline-powered cars, adhering to California's rigorous emissions standards as outlined in Section 177 of the Clean Air Act.

Each state is approaching this transition differently, with unique timelines and regulatory frameworks. For example, Maine and Vermont intend to enforce the ban by 2028 and 2030, respectively, while other states are targeting 2035.

This coordinated move highlights a substantial shift towards sustainable transportation, prompted by environmental and public health concerns. While challenges exist, especially in infrastructure and consumer preparedness, this represents a critical move towards a more sustainable future.
