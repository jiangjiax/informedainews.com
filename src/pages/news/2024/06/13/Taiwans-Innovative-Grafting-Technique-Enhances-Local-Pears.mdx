In Taiwan's New社 and 東勢, a unique agricultural technique known as "高接梨" transforms low-quality local pears into premium varieties through a process of grafting. This involves attaching high-quality Japanese pear buds to local trees, leveraging the local tree's root system to nourish the foreign buds. The result: sweet, juicy pears that rival those from colder climates.

This grafting method not only enhances the quality of the fruit but also creates a symbiotic economic relationship between Taiwanese and Japanese farmers. Japanese farmers gain an additional income from selling their buds, while Taiwanese farmers produce high-value fruit.

The metaphor extends beyond agriculture. Taiwan's industrial strategy mirrors this grafting technique, starting from humble beginnings and leveraging foreign technologies to produce globally competitive products. This approach underscores Taiwan's resilience and adaptability in the global market, turning what others discard into valuable assets.

The essence of this strategy lies in integrity and mutual benefit, ensuring that while Taiwan prospers, it does not undermine its partners. This ethical approach to business and technology is a cornerstone of Taiwan's success, setting it apart in a competitive world.
