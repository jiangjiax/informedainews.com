Gilead's twice-yearly HIV prevention shot, lenacapavir, demonstrated 100% effectiveness in a late-stage trial. None of the 2,000 women who received the shot contracted HIV. The trial's success prompted a recommendation to offer the treatment to all participants. This contrasts with the current standard of daily pills, which are utilized by only a third of those at risk in the U.S. Longer-acting treatments like this shot could significantly bolster global HIV prevention efforts.
