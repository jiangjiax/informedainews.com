Vice President Kamala Harris emphasizes the critical stakes of reproductive rights in the 2024 election, highlighting the stark contrast between Biden and Trump's positions. The Biden campaign, leveraging the Dobbs decision anniversary, plans over 50 events to underscore the impact of Trump-appointed justices on abortion rights. Harris warns of broader freedoms at risk if personal health decisions are compromised.

Trump, despite claiming credit for Dobbs, avoids endorsing a national abortion ban, suggesting states should decide. His stance on abortion pills remains unclear. The debate over abortion rights is poised to influence a closely contested election, with personal stories like Hadley Duvall's, a survivor of sexual assault, underscoring the urgency.

Biden and Trump prepare for their debate, each strategizing from private locations. The election's outcome could significantly alter access to reproductive healthcare, making voter decisions pivotal.
