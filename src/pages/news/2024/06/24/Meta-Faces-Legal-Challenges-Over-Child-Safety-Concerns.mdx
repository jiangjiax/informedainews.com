Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, is grappling with a wave of lawsuits from 45 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, alleging it has jeopardized child safety. These lawsuits echo historical actions against tobacco companies, accusing CEO Mark Zuckerberg of disregarding internal pleas for stronger safety measures for young users. Despite Meta's assertions of stringent safety protocols, incidents such as a teenager's suicide after a Facebook assault highlight the platform's inherent weaknesses.

The legal proceedings underscore a fundamental issue: Meta's prioritization of user engagement over the welfare of children. Internal communications indicate a strategy to boost teen usage, even if it compromises safety. While the company emphasizes its dedication to youth safety, evidence suggests insufficient resources are allocated to vital child protection programs.

This tension between corporate expansion and ethical duty raises profound questions about the impact of social media on adolescent mental health. As regulatory scrutiny grows, Meta faces the challenge of reconciling its business goals with authentic efforts to protect its youngest users.
