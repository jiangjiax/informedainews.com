China's inaugural 10-kilometer vertical landing test of a reusable rocket has been successfully conducted. The 3.8-meter-diameter rocket, equipped with a deep variable-thrust liquid oxygen methane engine, ascended to an altitude of 12 kilometers and executed a precise descent, landing softly. This test, the most significant of its kind in China, has validated crucial technologies for future 4-meter reusable rockets, with the goal of reducing the cost of accessing space. Following this, a 70-kilometer test will encompass typical rocket flight profiles.
