In Chicago, Angel Reese shone brightest, her 25 points and 16 rebounds leading the Sky past the Fever 88-87. This rookie's eighth consecutive double-double set a WNBA record. Caitlin Clark, her college rival, contributed 17 points and a record 13 assists for the Fever, but it wasn't enough.

This matchup showcased the WNBA's potential, with young stars and a growing fanbase. It's a testament to the league's evolution and the players' impact.
