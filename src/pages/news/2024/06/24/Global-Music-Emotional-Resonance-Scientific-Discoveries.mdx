**Universal Resonance of Music**

Research reveals that music evokes similar emotions and bodily responses worldwide. This resonance stems from biological mechanisms rather than cultural differences. Music, through its conveyed emotions, influences various parts of the body, enhancing its role in social connections.

**Symphony of Body and Emotion**

Music of different emotions, such as happiness, sadness, or fear, elicits corresponding sensations in different parts of the body. For example, upbeat music makes one want to move their limbs, while sad music touches the heartstrings.

**Cross-Cultural Resonance**

Western and Asian audiences exhibit similar emotional and bodily responses to music, indicating that music's emotional impact transcends cultural boundaries. Certain acoustic features of music, like rhythm and harmony, are closely linked to emotions.

**Social Role of Music**

Music may have evolved in human history, facilitating social interaction and group awareness by synchronizing body and emotion. This finding underscores the power of music as a universal language among humans.
