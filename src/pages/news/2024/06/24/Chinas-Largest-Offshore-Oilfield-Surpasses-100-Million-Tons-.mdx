China's largest offshore oilfield, Suizhong 36-1, has exceeded 100 million tons in cumulative crude production, equating to half of the nation's annual oil output and sufficient to sustain a city of ten million people for 20 years. Despite facing challenges such as freezing temperatures and viscous oil, technological advancements have facilitated efficient extraction. The field is currently undergoing a second adjustment project with the goal of increasing annual production capacity by 1 million tons, aiding in the revitalization of aging oilfields. Offshore oil now constitutes over 60% of China's oil production growth, a trend that has persisted for four consecutive years.
