CS-Bench, a new bilingual benchmark, assesses large language models (LLMs) in the domain of computer science. It encompasses 26 subfields and evaluates over 30 models. The results indicate robust correlations between computer science, mathematical, and coding proficiencies. CS-Bench pinpoints areas where LLMs can be enhanced and may reshape the way we evaluate AI reasoning within computer science.
