Apple aligns with OpenAI, differentiating its AI approach. Unlike cloud-centric competitors, Apple's AI, known as Apple Intelligence, remains device-bound, prioritizing user empowerment over replacement. A modest 3-billion parameter model contrasts with OpenAI's 175-billion parameter GPT-3, aiming for efficiency without battery drain. Integration of ChatGPT into Apple devices later this year aims to enhance Siri's capabilities. Privacy remains paramount; data stays local, avoiding cloud vulnerabilities. This cautious AI integration, focusing on personal data utility, marks a strategic shift, potentially reshaping AI's role in consumer tech.
