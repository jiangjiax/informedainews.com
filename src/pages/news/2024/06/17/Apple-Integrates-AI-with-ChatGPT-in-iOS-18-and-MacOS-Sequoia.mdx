Apple Intelligence makes its debut, integrating AI into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and MacOS Sequoia, with OpenAI's ChatGPT at its core. This strategic move by Apple is a response to competitors such as Samsung, Google, and Microsoft, who have already adopted generative AI.

Apple's strategy focuses on personal context, enhancing Siri's capabilities to understand and respond to natural language, handle follow-up questions, and interact with on-screen content. Siri's enhancements include on-screen awareness and the ability to execute tasks within apps, using personal context for more effective assistance.

Productivity tools are enhanced with features such as email prioritization, message summarization, and writing assistance across various apps. Apple emphasizes privacy, with many AI models running on-device and utilizing Private Cloud Compute for more demanding tasks.

Apple's AI integration aims to set itself apart by personalizing technology, ensuring it is not only intelligent but also relevant to each user's unique context.
