At the Shanghai Film Festival, Wang Changtian, CEO of Enlight Media, announced that Zhang Yimou will direct the film adaptation of "The Three Body Problem." This news ignited discussions about casting, with suggestions such as Gong Li for the older Ye Wenjie and Wang Yibao for Wang Miao. Professor Yan Feng of Fudan University commended Zhang as "both Chinese and global," a sentiment echoed by Liu Cixin, who expressed hope for Zhang's involvement, despite no current commitment. Zhang, who once strayed into commercialism, still possesses immense potential.
