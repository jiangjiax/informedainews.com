The Mall Group, a Thai commercial developer, is constructing Bangkok Mall with the goal of becoming Southeast Asia's largest shopping center. This mega-mall, scheduled for completion between 2026 and 2027, will include a 20,000-capacity arena, residential units, office spaces, and a hotel. Its strategic focus is on entertainment, aiming to attract tourists and compete with other luxury malls in Bangkok.

The group's recent addition, EmSphere, has already become a popular tourist destination, hosting concerts by artists like Ed Sheeran and Radwimps, which have drawn up to 200,000 visitors daily. The Mall Group, in partnership with Anschutz Entertainment Group, intends to attract international artists, leveraging the rapidly growing Southeast Asian music market, which is expected to double by 2028.

However, Thailand faces challenges with the availability of concert venues and infrastructure, leading The Mall Group to seek government support. Amidst regional competition, Thailand's appeal as a concert destination largely depends on these enhancements.
