CNN has established strict rules for the upcoming Biden-Trump debate, with the aim of curbing interruptions and maintaining decorum. Microphones will be muted except when a candidate is recognized to speak. No props are allowed.

**Moderators and Format**

Jake Tapper and Dana Bash will moderate the 90-minute event in Atlanta, enforcing timing and civility. The debate includes two commercial breaks, during which no interaction is allowed between candidates and their staff.

**Candidate Restrictions**

Both candidates will stand at uniform podiums, with their positions determined by a coin toss. They will have access to a pen, paper, and water, but no other props.

**Political Dynamics**

Biden and Trump, both in their eighties, are vying for undecided voters in a race characterized by stark differences in governance styles. Biden focuses on abortion rights, democracy, and the economy, while Trump emphasizes immigration, public safety, and inflation.

**Potential Third-Party Impact**

Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. shows potential to disrupt, polling at 15% in three national surveys and on the ballot in six states. His presence could sway the dynamics of the debate and the election.
