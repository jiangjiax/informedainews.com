In Florida, the Panthers, with NHL support, are cultivating hockey in Latino communities. Nearly 30% of Floridians are Latino, a demographic the NHL recognizes as integral for sport growth. The Panthers' Learn to Play initiative, part of a broader NHL strategy, aims to reduce barriers like cost and accessibility, offering affordable equipment and bilingual coaching.

Leo Jungerman, a Brazilian-born teen, exemplifies this outreach. Initially a novice, he now plays for the Junior Panthers, a journey facilitated by the Panthers' inclusive programs. The NHL's investment, over $4 million, supports such initiatives, fostering community and potential fan bases.

The Panthers' efforts extend beyond the ice, engaging schools and hosting cultural events like "Â¡Vamos Gatos!" and the LATAM Cup. These initiatives not only aim to popularize hockey but also to enrich community life.

As the Panthers excel in the Stanley Cup, their community work bolsters sport popularity, evident in rising Hispanic participation in their programs. This strategic engagement with diverse communities underscores a broader goal: building vibrant, healthy societies, not just developing athletes.
