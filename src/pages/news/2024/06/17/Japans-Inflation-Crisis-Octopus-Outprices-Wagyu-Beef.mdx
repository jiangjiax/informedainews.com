In Tokyo, octopus now surpasses wagyu beef in price. Inflation is hitting hard, with essentials like eggs and dairy products straining household budgets. Over 60% of consumers are feeling the financial squeeze, prioritizing affordability over taste. Food companies have increased prices on 614 products just in June.

Global demand, rising energy costs, and labor shortages are driving Japan's inflation. The weakening yen further exacerbates the problem, diminishing purchasing power. Takoyaki vendors, such as Aidsuya, are grappling with escalating octopus costs due to international competition, threatening their 500-yen price point.

Beef prices are also soaring, with U.S. imports hitting a 30-year peak. Japanese consumers are turning away, while South Korea emerges as a significant importer, capitalizing on a weaker won and lower tariffs.

Households are now dedicating a record 27.8% of their spending to food. With wages stagnant and costs rising, nonessential spending could be curbed, affecting broader economic activity. Farmers, already in decline, are experiencing squeezed profits from cost-push inflation, leading to a record number of agricultural bankruptcies.

Japan's culinary landscape and economy are being fundamentally reshaped by these pressures, with everyday choices and livelihoods at risk.
