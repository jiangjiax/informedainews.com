Researchers have developed an AI-enhanced controller for exoskeletons, eliminating the need for individual calibration and significantly reducing energy consumption. This advancement, detailed in a recent Nature article, promises to enhance human mobility, benefiting factory workers, astronauts, and the disabled alike.

The new controller, powered by a sophisticated neural network, learns human movements through millions of simulated muscle-skeletal evolutions, offering seamless torque assistance for walking, running, and climbing stairs without the need for human-involved testing. This "simulation learning" framework has achieved record-low metabolic rates, reducing energy consumption by 24.3% in walking, 13.1% in running, and 15.4% in stair climbing.

This breakthrough, bridging the gap from simulation to reality, marks a significant step forward in wearable robotics. It offers a scalable strategy for deploying assistive robots, potentially revolutionizing how we move and work, making the once fictional concept of energy-efficient human tasks a tangible reality.
