In the AI era, simplicity reigns. Most users seek effortless interaction with AI, bypassing the intricacies of crafting prompts. This desire fuels the popularity of AI agents, platforms where users can create and deploy these agents with minimal effort. Examples abound: a popular agent on a platform has been used by 675,000 people, another by 250,000, and a third boasts over 4.1 million interactions.

These platforms incentivize creation, offering visibility and even monetary rewards. For instance, Baidu prioritizes AI-generated content in search results and offers substantial cash incentives to creators. The potential for monetization is clear, as some agents have integrated advertising, demonstrating a viable revenue stream.

The author emphasizes the timeliness of engaging with AI agents, recalling past successful predictions and offering educational resources to newcomers. These include a basic course on AI agents, membership in a community focused on AI applications, and a comprehensive course on leveraging AI in the workplace.

In essence, the article underscores the current opportunity to capitalize on AI agent platforms, driven by user demand for simplicity and the platforms' support for creators.
