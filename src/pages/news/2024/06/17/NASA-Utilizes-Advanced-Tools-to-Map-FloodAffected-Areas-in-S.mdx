In 2024, floods devastated southern Brazil, particularly Rio Grande do Sul. NASA, using advanced tools, mapped the depths of this disaster. Their map, vital for relief efforts and economic assessments, detailed the extent of the flooding on May 6, 2024.

The map showed areas where water depths exceeded 5 meters, contrasted with shallower areas ranging from 0.1 to 1 meter. This precision is crucial for rescue operations, road closures, and damage assessment. Dinuke Munasinghe, a NASA JPL researcher, highlighted the significant impact on homes and livelihoods.

Employing the Flood Depth Estimation Tool (FwDET), which combines satellite imagery and terrain data, NASA delivered actionable insights. This tool, previously utilized in other flood events, is essential for disaster response.

NASA's open map portal enabled this support, providing a clear view of the catastrophe. The accuracy of these maps emphasizes the vital role of science in disaster management.
