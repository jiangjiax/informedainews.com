Taiwanese breakfast habits often lean towards high carbohydrate intake, lacking in fruits and vegetables, which leads to rapid spikes in blood sugar, affecting mental and physical energy. Nutritionist Xu Guiting suggests that breakfast should include more fiber, opting for high-nutrient-density whole foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables and eggs, and prioritizing low-GI foods to maintain stable blood sugar levels and promote overall health.

Incorporating fruits and vegetables into breakfast not only boosts metabolism but also aids in blood sugar control, enhancing cognitive and mental health. Popular breakfast combinations among Taiwanese, such as bread, sandwiches, and egg pancakes paired with soy milk, coffee, or milk, though convenient, are nutritionally unbalanced and can lead to obesity if consumed regularly.

Xu Guiting's breakfast upgrade strategy emphasizes balanced nutrition and choosing minimally processed foods, which helps reduce the risk of obesity and chronic diseases. This advice aligns with healthy eating principles and is worth considering for the general public.
