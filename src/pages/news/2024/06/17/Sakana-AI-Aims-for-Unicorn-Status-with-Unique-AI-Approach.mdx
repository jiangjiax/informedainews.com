Sakana AI, co-founded by ex-Google researchers, is targeting a $1.1 billion valuation through a $125 million funding round. This milestone would represent the fastest rise to unicorn status in Japan. Established in 2023, the startup diverges from the norm of massive AI systems, choosing a biological evolution-inspired method that combines smaller models to produce efficient, sophisticated AI. This approach, characterized by lower costs and energy requirements, has drawn international investors amid the thriving generative AI market.

Generative AI, as demonstrated by OpenAI's ChatGPT, has experienced explosive growth, attracting substantial venture capital. OpenAI is currently valued at $80 billion. Sakana's distinctive methodology sets it as a competitor in a sector dominated by tech giants like Google and OpenAI, signaling a move towards more sustainable AI development practices.
