Katie Ledecky clinched her fourth Olympic spot by winning the 400m freestyle at the US trials, clocking 3:58.35. This time, a reflection of her consistent excellence, positions her well for a possible gold in Paris, despite strong challenges from Ariarne Titmus and Summer McIntosh. Ledecky, already a six-time individual Olympic gold medalist, continues to exceed expectations, valuing each Olympic experience.

In parallel, Gretchen Walsh shattered the world record in the 100m butterfly with a time of 55.18, eclipsing Sarah Sjöström's 2016 record. Walsh's preliminary record is a career milestone, paving the way for a potential Olympic debut.

Aaron Shackell and Kieran Smith also secured their Olympic berths in the men's 400m freestyle, showcasing a formidable American team ready for success in Paris.
