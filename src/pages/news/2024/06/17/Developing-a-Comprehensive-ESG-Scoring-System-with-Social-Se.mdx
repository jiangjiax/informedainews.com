Summary:
This article explores the creation of a comprehensive ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) scoring system, enriched by the inclusion of social sentiment analysis. The project utilizes a Random Forest Regression Model, which is adept at combining predictions from numerous decision trees to improve accuracy and minimize overfitting. This model demonstrated a notable R2 Correlation of 26.1% and a modest Mean Absolute Average Error (MAAE) of 13.4%, surpassing other models in performance.

Insight:
The incorporation of social sentiment into ESG assessments represents a significant evolution, integrating broader societal values into corporate evaluations. This method not only measures traditional metrics but also encapsulates the intricate public opinion on corporate conduct, providing a more comprehensive perspective of a company's societal impact.
