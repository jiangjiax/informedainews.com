Coupang, South Korea's largest e-commerce platform, is facing a record 1,400 billion won fine for manipulating search rankings and fabricating product reviews. The company's practices, such as prioritizing its own brands in search results and having employees write positive reviews, undermine fair competition and consumer choice. Coupang disputes the fine, claiming it conflicts with digital innovation.

Search ranking manipulation refers to the act of altering algorithms to favor specific products or brands in search results, typically to increase sales of those items.
