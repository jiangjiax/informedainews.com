In Virginia, a new law shields residents from utility disconnections during extreme heat, commencing July 1. This legislation, opposed by utilities, bans cutoffs when temperatures surpass 92 degrees and on specific days to avert prolonged outages. State Senator Lashrecse Aird, a proponent, underscores the urgency due to rising global temperatures.

Across the U.S., utility disconnection protections vary significantly. Many states lack comprehensive safeguards, leaving millions at risk of power shutoffs, particularly during heatwaves. David Konisky, from Indiana University's Energy Justice Lab, emphasizes the critical need for improved policies, noting that current laws often fall short, focusing on regulated companies and lacking clear criteria.

The lab's "Disconnect Dashboard" exposes gaps in state protections, highlighting the dire need for more robust legislation. Konisky advocates for proactive measures such as affordable payment plans and energy assistance, prioritizing these over disconnections, which can be life-threatening in extreme heat.

As climate change escalates, the urgency to protect vulnerable populations from heat-related utility cutoffs intensifies. Virginia's law marks a step forward, but broader, more inclusive policies are essential nationwide.
