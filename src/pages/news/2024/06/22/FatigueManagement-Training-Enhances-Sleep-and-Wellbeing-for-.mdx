Fatigue-management training has demonstrated significant improvements in sleep, safety, and well-being among Seattle police officers. A collaborative study by Washington State University and the Seattle Police Department employed a randomized control trial to assess an eight-week online training program.

Centered on sleep hygiene, stress reduction, and nutrition, the training extended participants' daily sleep by an average of 18 minutes, totaling seven hours. Although this increase is relatively small, it correlates with enhanced health outcomes. The program also effectively diminished symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety, and reduced the likelihood of drowsy driving.

Despite potential impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and societal unrest, the study indicates that this type of training could be advantageous on a national scale, tackling issues of police fatigue and staffing shortages.

This intervention not only supports personal health but also potentially enhances community safety and service delivery by mitigating officer burnout and absenteeism.
