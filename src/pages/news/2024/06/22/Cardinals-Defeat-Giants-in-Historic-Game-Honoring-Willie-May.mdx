At Rickwood Field, a historic tribute. Donovan's homer led the Cardinals past the Giants, 6-5. This game, the first MLB event at the 114-year-old park, honored Willie Mays and the Negro Leagues. Mays, a legend who recently passed, played here with the Birmingham Black Barons.

Donovan, an Alabama native, shone, hitting his seventh home run of the season. The night was poignant, celebrating baseball's rich heritage. An all-Black umpire crew made history too.

Despite Ramos's tying homer, the Cardinals prevailed. Pallante's pitching, though challenged, secured the win. The Giants fought back but fell short.

Uniforms bore Mays's No. 24, a fitting tribute to a player who left an indelible mark on the game. This match was more than a game; it was a celebration of baseball's diverse legacy.
