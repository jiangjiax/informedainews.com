Amazon is transitioning from plastic to paper in North America, with over 90% of its operations now utilizing recyclable paper fillers instead of plastic air pillows. The goal is to achieve 100% use of paper by the end of the year. This shift represents a significant step towards sustainability, reducing plastic waste, and is a necessary change that has been long overdue.
