China issues guidelines for punishing 'diehard Taiwan separatists,' including death sentences for those causing grave harm to the state. The document targets Taiwan President Lai Ching-te's administration for not accepting the 'one-China' principle. Beijing aims to pressure Taipei by punishing acts promoting Taiwan's independence, such as organizing schemes to split the state or participating in international organizations as a sovereign state. Trials in absentia are possible, even for defendants outside the country. Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council rejects Beijing's jurisdiction over Taiwan and urges Taiwanese citizens to resist China's threats. The announcement highlights the contrast between China's authoritarian system and Taiwan's democratic one, impacting cross-strait relations and exchanges.
