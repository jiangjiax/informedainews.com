SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son regrets selling Nvidia shares too early, missing out on $1.5 trillion in potential gains. In 2019, his Vision Fund cashed out Nvidia shares for $33 billion, a significant profit from the initial $7 billion investment. However, Nvidia's meteoric rise, driven by AI demand, would have multiplied that return.

Son reminisces about a missed opportunity to acquire Nvidia in 2016, a deal that fell through. He also expresses interest in investing in OpenAI, creators of ChatGPT, which later partnered with Microsoft.

Despite these setbacks, Son remains optimistic about ARM, another of his investments, which powers most smartphones and is poised for growth in AI chip design. ARM's recent public listing valued it at $1.68 trillion, making it a crown jewel in SoftBank's portfolio.

Son's ultimate goal is to develop "super AI" (ASI), a technology he believes will revolutionize humanity's future, addressing critical issues like disease and war. His vision is clear: ASI, smarter than humans by a factor of 10,000, is the future he's building towards.
