Kitesurfing, the Olympic newcomer, promises speed and silence. Athletes harness wind and waves, propelling themselves at up to 80 kilometers per hour on hydrofoil boards. The sport compresses athleticism and strategy into brief, intense races.

Daniela Moroz, a six-time world champion, and Lauriane Nolot, recent world titleholder, aim for Olympic gold in Paris. Max Maeder, the young men's world champion, likens the sport's freedom to adding a steering wheel to a car.

Despite the thrill, kitesurfing carries risks; athletes wear protective gear and train to avoid collisions. The sport, once a niche activity, now boasts 3.5 million practitioners worldwide.

The Olympic debut in Marseille, a city known for its fierce Mistral wind, will showcase kitesurfing's unique blend of speed, skill, and strategy. Pioneers hope this exposure will inspire a new generation to take up the sport.
