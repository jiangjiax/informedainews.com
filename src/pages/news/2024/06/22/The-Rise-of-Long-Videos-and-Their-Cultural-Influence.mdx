In the era of fleeting short videos, long videos, with their profound storytelling and rich character development, have become a source of nationwide discussion. Unlike the fragmented nature of short videos, long videos can transcend age, gender, and occupation, uniting audiences from diverse backgrounds to create a shared cultural experience. High-quality long videos like "My Altay" not only spark a binge-watching craze but also ignite discussions on social media, driving related industries and showcasing significant commercial potential.

Long video platforms, through continuous investment and the addition of top talents, enhance content quality, attracting a vast and high-quality user base. The trend towards theaterization is strengthening, exemplified by iQIYI's Mist Theater focusing on suspense, solidifying its influence in the genre. Premium long videos create shared experiences, breaking through information silos, stimulating audience thought and discussion, conveying universal values, and establishing lasting cultural influence.

Brand marketing and long video platforms engage in a "mutual pursuit." Quality content leads to spillover influence, such as "The Queen's Gambit" boosting chess set sales and "My Altay" promoting local tourism. The centralization of IPs unleashes diverse commercial values, like "Fox Spirit Matchmaker: Moon Red Chapter" partnering with brands to offer immersive advertising experiences through innovative technology. Long videos not only offer "immediate" value through brand collaborations during broadcast but also hold long-term value as IPs.

Long videos are redefining the content and commercial ecosystem, crafting premium content, building centralized influence, attracting a vast high-quality user base, and collectively creating rich shared experiences. Platforms, based on a broad and precise audience, and driven by significant social influence, not only build a vibrant and valuable content ecosystem but also serve as a key prerequisite for leading the commercialization trend of long videos.
