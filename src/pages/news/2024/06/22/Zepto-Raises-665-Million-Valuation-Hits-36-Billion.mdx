Zepto, a Mumbai-based startup, secures $665 million in a Series F funding round, doubling its valuation to $3.6 billion. This rapid-delivery app thrives in India, delivering groceries and gadgets within 10 minutes, contrasting the struggles of similar models in developed markets.

Zepto's strategy involves a network of "dark stores"—compact, strategically located warehouses—enabling swift deliveries across urban areas. The startup aims to expand this network to over 700 stores by 2025, reporting a 140% year-on-year growth and an annualized GMV sales trajectory exceeding $1 billion.

Competing with BlinkIt and Swiggy’s Instamart, Zepto taps into India's hyper-local shopping culture, offering convenience unmatched by traditional grocery formats. While focusing on lower-stake categories like household appliances and cosmetics, Zepto avoids high-ticket electronics.

The startup's rapid expansion and profitability, with 75% of its dark stores EBITDA positive, suggest a promising future. Zepto's co-founder, Aadit Palicha, anticipates a public listing soon, buoyed by the positive reception in cities like Jaipur.

Industry analysts foresee quick commerce eroding the market share of e-commerce giants like Amazon and Flipkart, a view shared by investors like Avenir, who see Zepto as a formidable player in India's $150 billion quick commerce market.
