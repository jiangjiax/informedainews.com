CHICAGO (AP) â€” The James Beard Awards, often referred to as the Oscars of the culinary world, showcase a rich variety of finalists, ranging from Seattle's pho shops to Detroit's East African gem, Baobab Fare. Over 100 restaurants vie for honors in 22 categories, with substantial recognition and business growth on the line. Categories span from outstanding restaurateur, chef, to restaurant. Nominees are rigorously evaluated for culinary prowess and ethical practices.

Baobab Fare, managed by Burundi refugees Hamissi Mamba and Nadia Nijimbere, is celebrated for its tangy kuku chicken dish and is a finalist for outstanding restaurateur. Similarly, the Pham family, trailblazers of Seattle's inaugural pho shop, is acknowledged for their commitment to authentic Vietnamese cuisine.

The awards, which took a hiatus in 2020-2021 due to COVID-19 and internal challenges, now place a strong emphasis on diversity and ethical standards. Notable contenders include Michael Rafidi of Albi, a Michelin-starred restaurant that honors Palestinian cuisine, alongside other culinary talents from across the U.S.

These accolades underscore the culinary world's resilience and creativity, highlighting a tapestry of flavors and the compelling narratives behind them.
