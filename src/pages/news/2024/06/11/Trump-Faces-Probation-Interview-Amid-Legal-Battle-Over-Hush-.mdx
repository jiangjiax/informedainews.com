Former President Trump, convicted on 34 counts of hush money, is set to undergo a probation interview. This critical report, which will influence sentencing, may prompt Judge Juan Merchan to consider leniency given Trump's age and unblemished record. Scheduled for sentencing on July 11, Trump's defense team is preparing an appeal, contesting the verdict of the Manhattan jury. The charge involves falsifying business records, a Class E felony carrying a potential four-year prison sentence. The legal community is divided on whether incarceration will be pursued or enforced.

Trump's legal struggle marks a historic precedent: a former president facing criminal sentencing. The uncertain outcome rests heavily on the probation report and the judge's discretion.
