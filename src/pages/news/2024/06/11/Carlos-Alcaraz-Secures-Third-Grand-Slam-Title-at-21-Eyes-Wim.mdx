Carlos Alcaraz, 21, secured his first French Open title, complementing his Wimbledon and U.S. Open triumphs. His approach: aggressive play across all surfaces, refined through varied training. Alcaraz intends to get tattoos to mark each Slam's inaugural win, a tradition he will cap despite his swift success. His mental resilience, vital in surmounting physical hurdles during matches, distinguishes him.

Alcaraz's potential is vast, yet he stays humble, recognizing the challenge of capturing even one Slam. His goal is unambiguous: to extend his winning streak, possibly targeting the record 24 Grand Slams held by Novak Djokovic. Presently, Alcaraz celebrates his third major title, with future prospects wide and promising.
