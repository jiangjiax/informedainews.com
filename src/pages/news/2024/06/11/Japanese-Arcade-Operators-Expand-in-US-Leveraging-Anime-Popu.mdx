Japanese arcade operators Genda and Round One are aggressively expanding in the U.S., capitalizing on the rising popularity of anime. Genda, having acquired National Entertainment Network, plans to fill U.S. claw machines with Japanese character merchandise, aiming to double its American presence by 2020. Round One, focusing on both arcade and entertainment venues, aims to quadruple its footprint by 2032, leveraging the demand for anime-related products.

This strategy leverages the U.S. market's increasing interest in anime, spurred by increased streaming during COVID-19 lockdowns. By providing exclusive, high-quality prizes, these companies enhance the arcade experience and contribute to Japan's cultural export goals, aligning with the government's Cool Japan Strategy. This expansion could reshape the U.S. arcade landscape, integrating entertainment with cultural exchange.
