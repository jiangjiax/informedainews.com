India and China are facing critical World Cup qualifiers in Asia, where a defeat could potentially end their chances. China, which once co-hosted the event, is now up against South Korea, a tough rival with a strong historical advantage. Despite the odds, China's coach, Ivankovic, remains steadfast.

In a similar vein, India's prospects rely on a match against Qatar, the current Asian champion. Coach Stimac encourages faith in India's young team. Both countries, with their large populations, generate substantial global interest in their performances.

Meanwhile, other Asian teams are competing fiercely for the remaining spots in the third stage of qualification, heightening the competition. The stakes are extremely high, and the pressure is intense as each nation fights for a shot at the 2026 World Cup.
