Macron, stung by far-right gains in EU elections, gambles on snap legislative polls to curb their rise. His party, once dominant, now struggles against Marine Le Pen's National Rally, bolstered by a rebranding that softened its extremist image.

The risk: a fragmented left might fail to unite, allowing the far right to lead France's government for the first time since WWII. Macron's hope hinges on a coalition against extremism, a strategy that's historically worked but faces new challenges.

Le Pen, emboldened, eyes a transformative role, while her protégé, Jordan Bardella, gains traction. If the National Rally secures a majority, Macron must appoint a far-right prime minister, complicating his domestic agenda but retaining control over foreign policy.

This move, a high-stakes bet, could either stabilize France's political landscape or usher in a seismic shift.
