Shohei Ohtani, a two-time AL MVP, now playing in the NL, has left the MVP race wide open. Aaron Judge, the 2022 MVP, leads with a .361 batting average and 14 home runs in May. Juan Soto, former NL MVP runner-up, impresses in his debut with the Yankees. Shortstops Gunnar Henderson and Bobby Witt Jr. are shining, with Henderson possibly repeating Cal Ripken's rookie-MVP back-to-back achievement. Kyle Tucker, despite an injury, remains a contender. Ohtani, sidelined from pitching, hits .310 with 15 homers for the Dodgers.

The league experiences a rare decline in .500+ teams, potentially allowing sub-.500 teams into the playoffs. Ryan Howard, Dustin Pedroia, and Kris Bryant are the post-Ripken MVPs who won after being named Rookie of the Year.

Kansas City's remarkable season includes a 1.0% chance comeback win against Seattle, sealed by a groundball that wasn't turned into a double play.
