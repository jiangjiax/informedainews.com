Trump's TikTok Triumph

Once intent on banning TikTok, Trump now boasts over 600 million followers on the platform, significantly overshadowing Biden's 36.5 million. This dramatic shift underscores TikTok's profound influence in American digital culture, engaging half the digital population and the majority of those under 30.

TikTok's meteoric rise supports ByteDance's $268 billion valuation, driven by rapid revenue growth that exceeded $110 billion in 2020. Despite U.S. security concerns, TikTok continues to flourish globally, expanding its presence in the Middle East and dominating markets such as Indonesia.

Both Trump and Biden, initially opposed to TikTok, now utilize it, underscoring its critical role in contemporary political campaigns. TikTok's ability to withstand potential bans suggests that its global expansion and diversification could mitigate any losses in the U.S. market.
