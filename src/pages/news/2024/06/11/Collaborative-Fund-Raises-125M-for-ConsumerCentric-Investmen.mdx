Collaborative Fund, undeterred by venture capital norms, has raised $125 million in a challenging fundraising environment. Focusing on consumer-centric sectors such as climate, health, and food, they avoid the popular SaaS model. Founder Craig Shapiro views the current market slowdown as an opportunity, where valuations are reasonable and competition is low due to decreasing interest in consumer investing.

The fund, which took over 90 days to complete, attracted a diverse range of investors, including endowments and high net-worth individuals. Collaborative's success is highlighted by recent exits, such as Reddit's IPO and Scopely's acquisition.

Shapiro emphasizes the importance of consumer spending habits and the widespread impact of climate sustainability across all sectors. The fund will primarily support seed-stage companies, allocating half for initial investments and the remainder for follow-ups.

In essence, Collaborative Fund excels by investing in overlooked and necessary areas, navigating a market that others find challenging.
