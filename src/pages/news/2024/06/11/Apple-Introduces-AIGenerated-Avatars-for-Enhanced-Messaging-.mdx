Apple unveils AI-enhanced messaging in iOS 18, introducing Genmoji, a feature that allows users to create personalized AI images of their conversation partners, similar to an advanced Bitmoji. This innovation turns daily chats into visual narratives, commemorating events like birthdays or expressing personal tributes.

Initially, Genmoji supports three styles: sketch, illustration, and animation. Drawing inspiration from Easel, a startup founded by former Snap researchers, the technology integrates beyond messaging into Notes, Freeform, Keynote, and Pages.

Another feature, Image Playground, enables users to generate images based on various themes and costumes without needing specific prompts. Apple Intelligence, operating locally, suggests related concepts, enhancing user interaction across apps.

This integration of AI into daily digital interactions marks a shift towards more personalized, visually engaging communication, setting a new standard for how technology can interpret and reflect human emotions and contexts.
