A novel device called Joey, developed by researchers at Columbia University, revolutionizes the practice of Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) for infants with low birth weight. This wearable device, shaped like a necklace, incorporates ECG sensors to monitor the heart activity of both the mother and the infant during skin-to-skin contact.

KMC, which has been endorsed by the WHO since 2003, significantly reduces infant mortality and improves development. Joey ensures the optimal duration of KMC and provides real-time health data, alerting mothers when medical intervention is necessary.

After being tested on 35 pairs, Joey accurately measures the duration of KMC sessions and delivers vital sign readings that are clinically acceptable. This innovation uses soft, conductive fabrics, offering a comfortable alternative to traditional rigid sensors.

Joey represents the integration of technology and empathy, ensuring that the lifesaving embrace of KMC is both effective and informed. Its use of soft materials signifies a significant shift in physiological monitoring, making healthcare more accessible and humane.
