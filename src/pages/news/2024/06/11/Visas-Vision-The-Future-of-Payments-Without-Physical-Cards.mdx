Visa's Mark Nelsen envisions a future where plastic credit cards become obsolete. As the world's largest payment processor, his company is leading the charge in transforming payment processing to simplify consumer choices.

A key innovation is the "flexible credential," which enables a single card to perform multiple roles—debit, credit, or crypto payments—based on user preferences. This flexibility allows one card to process transactions under $100 as a debit and over that amount as a credit, or even facilitate installment payments.

Visually, the card maintains its physical form and 16-digit number, but digitally, it connects to multiple accounts, eliminating the need to store card details with merchants. Instead, a unique transaction number is generated for each purchase. This feature is already in use in Japan and is slated for introduction in the U.S. in the coming months.

Furthermore, the "Tap to Pay" system is advancing. Consumers can now simply tap their card to their phone to add it to digital wallets like Apple Pay or Google Pay, enhancing both convenience and security.

These innovations signify a departure from traditional payment methods, adopting a more integrated and user-friendly approach to financial transactions.
