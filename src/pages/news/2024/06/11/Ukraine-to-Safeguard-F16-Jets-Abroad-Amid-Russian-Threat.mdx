Ukraine plans to safeguard some F-16 jets abroad, away from Russian strikes. Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Norway have pledged over 60 jets to Ukraine, with pilots currently in training. Serhii Holubtsov, Ukraine's aviation chief, explained that storing jets abroad ensures a ready fleet that matches the number of trained pilots.

Russian President Putin has warned of striking NATO bases if they host jets used against Russia, escalating the risk of NATO's involvement. Putin's March warning reiterated that such bases would be considered "legitimate targets," given the F-16s' nuclear capability.

F-16s require high-standard runways and fortified hangars, which are scarce in Ukraine. Holubtsov hopes these jets will help push back Russian aircraft using glide bombs, thereby reducing damage to front-line areas.

As Russia intensifies its attacks, NATO allies are allowing Ukraine to use delivered weapons for limited strikes inside Russia, potentially disrupting Moscow's offensive plans. In response, Putin threatens to arm Western adversaries globally.

*Glide bombs: Soviet-era heavy bombs equipped with precision guidance, launched from beyond air defense range.
