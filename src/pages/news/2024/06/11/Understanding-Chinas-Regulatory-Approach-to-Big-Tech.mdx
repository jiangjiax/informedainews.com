"High Wire: How China Regulates Big Tech and Governs Its Economy" by Angela Zhang explores the intricate relationship between Beijing and Big Tech. As a legal scholar at the University of Hong Kong, Zhang introduces a "dynamic pyramid model" of regulatory governance, emphasizing the interplay among state leaders, bureaucrats, tech giants, and consumers.

Zhang outlines three primary characteristics of China's regulatory framework: hierarchy, volatility, and fragility. She examines how these elements impact emerging technologies, balancing growth with stability and innovation with security. The book also investigates the volatility of Chinese regulation, linking it to varied bureaucratic incentives and delays in policy execution.

A significant case study involves the cancellation of Ant Financial's IPO, where Zhang challenges simplistic explanations, asserting that regulatory concerns about potential monopoly power were crucial. Her analysis steers clear of oversimplified judgments, providing a nuanced perspective on the intricate interactions between government, think tanks, and private sectors in China's political economy.

Zhang's work serves as an insightful guide, shedding light on the complex regulatory environment of China's tech sector.
