Marble, a startup backed by Khosla Ventures, is addressing the escalating mental health concerns among U.S. teens with affordable online group therapy. Founded by former Headway co-founders Jake Sussman and Dan Ross, Marble tackles the national shortage of mental health professionals by utilizing group therapy sessions, which are as effective as individual therapy but less frequently offered due to logistical challenges.

Sussman, having previously taught fifth grade, directly witnessed the shortcomings in school mental health support systems. Marble overcomes traditional obstacles by collaborating with school counselors and billing insurance, including Medicaid, which covers the cost of group sessions at a rate that sustains the business while offering competitive compensation for therapists.

This approach not only reduces lengthy wait times for therapy but also customizes groups to specific demographics, thereby enhancing effectiveness. Marble intends to extend its services beyond New York, capitalizing on the evident need and the streamlined, scalable nature of its model.
