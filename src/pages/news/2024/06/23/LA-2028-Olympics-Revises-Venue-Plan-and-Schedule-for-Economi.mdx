Los Angeles 2028 Olympics revises venue plan, aiming for $156 million in savings and revenue. Swimming at SoFi Stadium, basketball at Intuit Dome, gymnastics at Crypto.com Arena. Athletics remains at LA Memorial Coliseum.

Schedule adjustments: Athletics in the first week, swimming in the second. Softball and canoe slalom relocated to Oklahoma City to avoid temporary venues and align with IOC's sustainability goals.

Sepulveda Basin hosts BMX, skateboarding, and archery. Diving returns to the historic 1932 Olympic pool. Long Beach adds artistic and para swimming. Equestrian events move to Temecula. Shooting relocates to an unspecified club outside LA.

Each venue change targets at least $10 million in economic benefits, reducing temporary infrastructure requirements. The organizing committee awaits city approval for events outside the city.

The venue plan has been updated since 2017, reflecting new stadiums and arenas available.
