Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is championing the nation's cuisine to elevate its global culinary standing, aiming to surpass regional favorites like Thai and Vietnamese dishes. In a recent Facebook video, Marcos highlighted local delicacies such as sinigang and adobo, urging international recognition.

The government has initiated a campaign targeting the Filipino diaspora to promote their homeland's food worldwide. This effort includes the launch of "Eatsperience," an event in Manila that invites tourists to sample local fare. Despite the Philippines ranking 33rd on TasteAtlas's list of top cuisines, it lags behind neighbors like Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam.

Tourism Secretary Christina Garcia Frasco is spearheading gastronomy tourism, offering culinary tours that delve into the country's rich culinary traditions. The campaign aims to diversify perceptions of Philippine food beyond fast-food chains like Jollibee, showcasing its Spanish-influenced haute cuisine and regional specialties.
