Amazon eyes AI for Alexa, Starbucks slashes prices.

Amazon is planning a significant overhaul of Alexa, integrating generative AI and potentially introducing a subscription model. This initiative aims to boost Alexa's functionality, enabling it to handle complex tasks such as composing emails and ordering meals. If consumers embrace this, it could help mitigate losses.

Starbucks, grappling with a sales downturn, has introduced a $5 value menu to attract price-conscious customers. This pricing strategy is a modest step in a lengthy recovery process.

In the market, Nvidia's stock experienced a surge followed by a decline, exchanging the position of the top U.S. company with Microsoft and Apple. The Dow Jones led weekly gains, while the energy sector, buoyed by robust U.S. gasoline demand, topped the S&P 500 sectors.

Next week's economic indicators include housing data and the PCE price index, which is the Fed's preferred measure of inflation.
