Namibia's High Court struck down a colonial-era law criminalizing gay sex between men, deeming it unconstitutional. This ruling, a victory for LGBTQ rights, removes unfair discrimination rooted in the nation's apartheid past. The decision aids in dismantling stigma and enhancing access to healthcare for the LGBTQ community. In Africa, where 31 countries still criminalize same-sex activity, this marks a significant step towards equality.
