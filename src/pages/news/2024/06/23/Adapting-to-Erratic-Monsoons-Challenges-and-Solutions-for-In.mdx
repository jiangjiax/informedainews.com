Climate change has disrupted India's monsoon patterns, crucial for its 120 million farmers. Monsoons, once predictable, now bring either excessive rain or drought, threatening crops and livelihoods. Farmers struggle with planting and harvesting due to these erratic conditions.

The Indian Meteorological Department's predictions have been unreliable, further complicating farming strategies. Traditional crops that require consistent irrigation are at risk, leading to agricultural failures and economic strain. In response, some suggest growing drought-resistant crops and improving localized weather forecasts.

However, adapting to these changes is challenging. Farmers in regions like Maharashtra and Haryana face severe consequences, including increased suicides and flooding. Solutions proposed include better compensation for losses, climate-resilient seeds, and efficient supply chains.

Efforts to adapt are underway. In Kerala, a farming collective adjusts planting and harvesting times based on updated weather patterns, reducing losses and improving yields. This localized approach, if scaled nationally, could help Indian farmers navigate the unpredictable monsoons of a warming world.
