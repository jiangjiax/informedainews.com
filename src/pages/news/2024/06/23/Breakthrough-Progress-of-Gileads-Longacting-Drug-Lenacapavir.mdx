The World Health Organization considers AIDS a significant global public health issue. By the end of 2022, it is estimated that there were 39 million people living with HIV worldwide. Since its first reported case in 1981, over 35 million people have died from the disease. In 2022 alone, there were approximately 130 million new infections, with one person dying from AIDS every minute on average.

Gilead Sciences recently announced groundbreaking trial results for its drug Lenacapavir, which requires only two injections per year and demonstrated 100% prevention efficacy. The Phase III trial, conducted among over 5,300 young women in South Africa and Uganda, yielded encouraging results—none of the 2,134 women who received the injections contracted the virus.

Founded in 1987, Gilead, despite its youth, has established a significant presence in the field of antiviral drugs. In 2023, its revenue reached $271.16 billion, with a staggering $57.18 billion invested in research and development, accounting for 21% of its revenue, highlighting its commitment to innovation.

Personal Insight:
Gilead's success lies not only in the breakthrough of its drugs but also in its dedication and innovative spirit. In the integration of commerce and medicine, Gilead demonstrates the possibility of capital coexisting with virtue. This advancement brings new hope for AIDS prevention and underscores the importance of focused and sustained R&D investment in pharmaceutical innovation.
