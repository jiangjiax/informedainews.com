Gilead's twice-yearly HIV prevention shot, lenacapavir, demonstrated 100% effectiveness in a late-stage trial. None of the 2,000 women who received the shot contracted HIV. The trial's success prompted a recommendation to offer the treatment to all participants. This contrasts with the current standard of daily pills, which are used by less than half of those at risk in the U.S. Longer-acting treatments like this shot could significantly bolster HIV prevention efforts globally.
