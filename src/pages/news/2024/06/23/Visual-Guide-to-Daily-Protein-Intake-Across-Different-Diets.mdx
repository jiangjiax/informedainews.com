Protein is essential for bodily functions, including hormone regulation and molecule transport. For most individuals, a daily intake of 100 grams is ideal, although active individuals may need more.

The article visually demonstrates how to meet this intake across various diets:

**Omnivores** can easily achieve 100 grams by incorporating yogurt, nuts, eggs, ham, cheese, oats, and tuna into their meals.

**Vegetarians** might reach nearly 100 grams by consuming eggs, oats, peanut butter, hemp seeds, protein granola, cheese, and yogurt.

**Vegans** have a slightly more challenging task, typically reaching about 93 grams with granola, protein powder, nuts, peanut butter, chia and hemp seeds, bread, and oats. Incorporating high-protein vegan alternatives like tofu or tempeh can help close the gap.

This guide helps visualize daily protein requirements, highlighting the importance of dietary choices in achieving nutritional objectives.
