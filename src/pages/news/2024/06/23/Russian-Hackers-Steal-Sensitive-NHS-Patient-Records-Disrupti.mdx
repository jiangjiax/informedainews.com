Russian hackers, known as the Qilin gang, have stolen sensitive records from the NHS, encompassing 300 million patient interactions. This breach includes critical data such as HIV and cancer blood test results. The attack targeted Synnovis, a joint venture providing pathology services to seven hospitals under two NHS trusts.

The stolen data's scope is extensive, covering years of patient records from both NHS and private healthcare providers. Despite a reported $50 million ransom demand, Qilin has already leaked some files, totaling 380GB, on a messaging platform. This leak includes patient names, dates of birth, and test details.

The impact is severe, with hospitals and GP practices in south-east London significantly reducing blood tests and canceling over 1,134 operations and 2,194 appointments. The NHS is struggling to restore normal operations, currently managing only 30% of usual blood tests.

This incident highlights the vulnerability of healthcare data and the catastrophic effects of cyberattacks on patient care and privacy.
