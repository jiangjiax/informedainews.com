Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are surging globally, threatening health with chronic diseases like obesity and diabetes. Prof. Carlos Monteiro, who coined "UPF," urges tobacco-style warnings on these products. UPFs, often cheaper and more convenient, displace healthier options, driven by profit-focused marketing. Monteiro suggests banning UPF sales in schools and health facilities, taxing them, and using funds to subsidize fresh foods. He compares UPFs to tobacco, both causing severe health issues and backed by aggressive corporate strategies against regulation. Reformulation isn't enough; public health campaigns are crucial.
