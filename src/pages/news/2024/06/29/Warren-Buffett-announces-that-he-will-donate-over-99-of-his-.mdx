Warren Buffett, known as the "Oracle of Omaha," has announced that he will donate over 99% of his estate to charity upon his death. His will stipulates that the wealth will be transferred to five foundations, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust. However, donations to the foundation will cease after his passing. Buffett's children will take over the management of the charitable trust fund's contributions. This move underscores his commitment to social responsibility and his trust in his descendants' capabilities.
