Former Uvalde schools police chief Pete Arredondo and officer Adrian Gonzales have been indicted on multiple counts of felony child endangerment and abandonment for their slow response to the 2022 school massacre that killed 19 children and two teachers. The indictments, confirmed by the local district attorney, mark the first criminal charges against officers involved in one of the deadliest school shootings in US history. Both officers are expected to turn themselves in.

The incident, which saw an 18-year-old gunman hold a classroom hostage for over 70 minutes before being confronted by officers, has been heavily criticized. Reports by Texas lawmakers and the US Department of Justice highlighted failures by law enforcement to prioritize saving lives over their own safety, with hundreds of officers present but inactive during the shooting.

Uvalde remains divided, with some seeking closure and others demanding accountability. Robb Elementary School, the site of the tragedy, is now permanently closed, with a new school under construction.
