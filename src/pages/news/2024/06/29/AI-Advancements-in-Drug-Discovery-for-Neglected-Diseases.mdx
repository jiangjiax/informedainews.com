In 2019, computer scientist Guo Jinjin, inspired by his aunt's medical work in Africa, shifted his focus to drug discovery. He joined the Global Health Drug Discovery Institute (GHDDI), dedicated to tackling diseases like malaria and tuberculosis, which are often neglected due to their low profitability.

Traditional drug discovery involves sifting through millions of compounds to identify one that effectively targets a disease. This process, akin to finding a needle in a haystack, is time-consuming and inefficient.

Guo initially believed that AI could quickly identify effective compounds, similar to its high accuracy in image recognition. However, he soon realized the complexity of biological data, necessitating a multidisciplinary approach.

At GHDDI, a team integrates biology, chemistry, physics, and computer science to train AI models. These models, once refined, can screen millions of compounds in hours, significantly enhancing the discovery of potential drugs.

Furthermore, GHDDI employs generative AI, which designs new compounds tailored to specific disease targets, potentially addressing drug resistance. This advanced approach, supported by Microsoft's computational power, promises more precise and innovative drug designs.

Despite these advancements, the journey from compound discovery to a marketable drug remains challenging, involving extensive testing and regulatory hurdles.

Guo reflects on his initial naivety about drug development but remains steadfast, driven by the potential to save lives by accelerating the discovery process.

**Insight:**
The integration of AI in drug discovery represents a significant shift, not just in efficiency but in addressing diseases that have long been sidelined. This innovation not only speeds up the process but also democratizes access to medical advancements, potentially transforming global health outcomes.
