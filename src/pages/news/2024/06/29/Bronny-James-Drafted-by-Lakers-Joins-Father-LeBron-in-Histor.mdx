Bronny James, son of LeBron, was drafted by the Lakers at No. 55. This marks the first time a father-son duo will play together. Bronny's college career was overshadowed by a heart issue, which has now been resolved. LeBron, aged 39, remains a formidable force, particularly excelling in 3-point shooting. This is a historic moment in NBA family history.
