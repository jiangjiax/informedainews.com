TechCrunch Mobility reports on the dynamic world of transportation, highlighting key developments and deals. Notably, Volkswagen Group and Rivian have forged a significant partnership, with VW investing $1 billion initially and a total of $5 billion over time. This alliance aims to leverage Rivian's electric vehicle (EV) technology and VW's manufacturing prowess, potentially reshaping the EV market.

In other news, autonomous vehicle (AV) company Cruise has undergone internal restructuring and faced regulatory fines, yet remains a pivotal player in the AV sector. Meanwhile, Waymo has expanded its robotaxi service in San Francisco, signaling progress in autonomous mobility.

Electric vehicle startup Fisker's bankruptcy proceedings reveal financial challenges and a contentious asset dispute, underscoring the volatility in the EV industry.

Tech and innovation in automotive luxury are exemplified by the Bugatti Tourbillon, which eschews conventional digital interfaces for a handcrafted instrument cluster, blending traditional craftsmanship with modern technology. This approach suggests a future where luxury cars may prioritize bespoke, artisanal elements over ubiquitous digital screens.
