Frank Bensel, 56, from Jupiter, Florida, achieved a remarkable feat by acing two consecutive holes at the U.S. Senior Open. He scored a hole-in-one on the fourth and fifth holes, both par-3s, at Newport Country Club. This is a rare accomplishment, especially for consecutive par-3s. Despite these impressive moments, Bensel faced challenges throughout the game, starting four over par and then recording bogeys on the next two holes.
