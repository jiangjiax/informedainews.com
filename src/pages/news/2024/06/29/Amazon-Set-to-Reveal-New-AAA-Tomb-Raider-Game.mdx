Amazon is set to unveil a new 3A-rated "Tomb Raider" game, marking a shift from traditional publisher SE to Amazon as the distributor. Christoph Hartmann, Amazon Games VP, hints at an imminent reveal, though not specifying a release date. This venture underscores Amazon's ambition to penetrate the 3A gaming market, leveraging established IPs like "Tomb Raider" and "The Lord of the Rings." Fans anticipate a fully open-world experience set in India, a departure from previous trilogies.
