Some people never catch COVID-19, even when exposed. Scientists are studying these "super-dodgers" to understand why.

In a recent study, high activity of the gene HLA-DQA2 was found in those who avoided infection. This gene flags invaders for the immune system, enabling quick destruction of the virus.

The study also highlighted the importance of immune responses in the nose and blood. This could lead to the development of nasal spray vaccines, aiming to block infection entirely, not just severe illness.

Understanding these immune responses could revolutionize vaccine design, potentially stopping the virus before it takes hold.
