Apple unveiled a new feature at WWDC: satellite-based Messages. This tool allows iPhone users to send iMessages and SMS texts without relying on Wi-Fi or cellular service, making it especially useful in remote areas such as hiking trails where traditional connectivity is limited.

The process is simple: when your iPhone senses a lack of service, it prompts you to connect via satellite. Once connected, conversations proceed normally, with occasional prompts to realign if the satellite's position changes. It's important to note that while iMessages are unrestricted, SMS messages require manual initiation to avoid congestion from automated messages.

Currently, this feature is available only on the iPhone 14 and later models, initially in the U.S., with plans for international expansion. It is free for now, but Apple intends to implement a fee in the future. This feature highlights Apple's dedication to improving communication accessibility, even in the most remote locations.
