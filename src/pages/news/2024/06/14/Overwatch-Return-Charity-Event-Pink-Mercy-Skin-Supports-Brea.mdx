"Overwatch" Returns Charity Event

Blizzard Entertainment is reintroducing the "Pink Mercy" skin, available for a limited time from June 26 to July 9. All proceeds from sales, after deducting costs, will be donated to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. Additionally, the "Rose Gold Mercy Bundle" has been introduced, with proceeds also going to the charity.

Breast cancer is a common and deadly disease among women. The foundation is advancing research, including developing AI tools for mammography, predicting treatment responses, and exploring drugs to delay tumor growth.

This initiative not only serves a charitable purpose but also unites people in the collective fight against the disease.
