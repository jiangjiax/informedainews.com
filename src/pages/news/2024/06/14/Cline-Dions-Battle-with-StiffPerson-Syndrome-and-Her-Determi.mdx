Amidst the neon desert of Las Vegas, Céline Dion reveals her battle with stiff-person syndrome (SPS), a rare autoimmune disorder that stiffens muscles, hindering movement and vocal control. Initially dismissing symptoms as trivial, Dion's condition escalated over years, forcing adjustments in her performances and a retreat from the public eye.

Diagnosed in 2022, SPS explained the spasms and rigidity that compromised her singing. Known for her powerful voice, Dion adapted by altering song keys and her vocal approach, masking her struggle. Despite numerous consultations with ear, nose, and throat specialists yielding no visible issues, her voice faltered.

Dion's resilience is evident as she juggled her deteriorating health with family responsibilities, including caring for her husband, René Angélil, until his death from throat cancer. Her sons, now equipped to handle her medical emergencies, underscore the personal toll of her condition.

Determined, Dion plans a comeback, acknowledging the need to be honest with her fans. Her story is one of courage, not just in facing a debilitating condition but in the public admission of her struggle.
