Lynn Conway, a pioneering figure in computer science and transgender rights, passed away at the age of 85. Her contributions to VLSI design transformed the field of microelectronics, playing a pivotal role in the development of the Pentium chip. After transitioning in 1968, she faced dismissal from IBM, which led to years of struggle and separation from her daughters. However, Conway later flourished at Xerox PARC and DARPA, significantly influencing modern computing. Her life, characterized by resilience and innovation, reached a significant milestone when IBM issued a 2020 apology, recognizing her trailblazing spirit and the societal advancements it inspired.
