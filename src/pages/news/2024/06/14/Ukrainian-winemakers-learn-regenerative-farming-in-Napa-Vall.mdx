In Ukraine, war has left vineyards mined, posing a danger to winemaker Georgiy Molchanov. Roots of Peace, Rotary International, and Grgich Hills Estate have stepped in to assist. They provide training in regenerative organic farming for Molchanov and his peers in Napa Valley, with the goal of healing both the land and the spirits of those affected.

Svitlana Tsybak, another Ukrainian winemaker, amidst the conflict, is looking to expand into U.S. markets. Heidi Kuhn, the founder of Roots of Peace, advocates for the "mines to vines" initiative, aiming to transform war-torn areas into productive agricultural lands. Ivo Jeramaz, who shares a history of war experiences, offers support and hope to these winemakers.

This initiative is not just about agriculture; it symbolizes resilience and rebirth. Amidst the devastation, these winemakers exemplify the human spirit's determination to rebuild and cultivate peace where once there was war.
