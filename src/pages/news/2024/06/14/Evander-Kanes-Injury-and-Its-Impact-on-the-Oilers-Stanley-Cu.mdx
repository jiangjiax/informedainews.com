In Edmonton, Evander Kane is battling a sports hernia, his performance dwindling with only one point in eight games. The Oilers, trailing 2-0 in the Stanley Cup Final, face a tough decision: retain Kane, a physical asset, or rest him for Game 3.

Hockey history is filled with tales of players enduring pain for the Cup. However, Kane's situation parallels Matthew Tkachuk's, who was sidelined last year after a sternum fracture. Panthers coach Paul Maurice stepped in, acknowledging when continuing to play was pointless.

Kane, despite limited ice time and defensive errors, remains in the lineup, motivated by a commentator's saying: if dressed, perform. Coach Kris Knoblauch evaluates Kane's contributions against his limitations, considering a roster deep enough to adapt.

The decision hangs in the balance, weighing a warrior's spirit against pragmatic strategy. The Oilers' depth provides options, but the heart of a competitor, like Kane's, adds complexity to the decision-making process.
