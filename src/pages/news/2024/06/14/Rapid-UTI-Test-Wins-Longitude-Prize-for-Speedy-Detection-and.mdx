A rapid UTI test, capable of identifying treatment in 45 minutes, has won the £8m Longitude prize. Developed by Sysmex Astrego, this test utilizes a urine sample to detect bacterial infection within 15 minutes and recommends an antibiotic within 45 minutes. Traditional lab tests typically take two to three days.

The impact of this test is significant, addressing the critical issue of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), where antibiotics lose their effectiveness. AMR is responsible for nearly 1.3 million deaths annually and is projected to rise to 10 million by 2050.

Currently, doctors often prescribe antibiotics based on symptoms, leading to overuse and resistance. This new test enables precise antibiotic prescription, potentially reducing resistance and enhancing patient care.

Although currently priced at £25 per cartridge, the test has the potential to become more affordable with increased production and public sector adoption. This could revolutionize UTI treatment globally, especially in low-resource settings.

The Longitude prize winner not only represents a technological advancement but also a strategic shift in antibiotic management, moving from 'just-in-case' prescribing to targeted, effective treatment.
