Mozilla Firefox 127.0 has been released, introducing DNS pre-fetching to accelerate web page loading, enhanced screenshot features, and strengthened user privacy with User Agent (UA) protection. Users can now easily close duplicate tabs and designate Firefox as a startup application on Windows. A significant update involves reporting 32-bit Linux systems as "x86_64" to conceal user architecture details, thereby enhancing privacy.

DNS pre-fetching allows the browser to predict and resolve domain names ahead of user interaction, thereby expediting page loading times. UA protection now masks the user's system architecture, reducing tracking and improving compatibility with websites.
