Fox Sports secures IndyCar broadcasting rights from 2025, adding the Indianapolis 500 to its portfolio alongside the Daytona 500. This move consolidates two of the world's premier races under one network. NBC, the previous broadcaster since 2009, experienced declining viewership, partly due to moving races to cable and its streaming app, Peacock.

Fox promises comprehensive coverage, featuring all races on Fox and the Fox Sports app, along with exclusive Spanish-language coverage on Fox Deportes. This includes all practice and qualifying sessions, marking a significant departure from NBC's approach.

IndyCar CEO Mark Miles commends the deal for its potential to enhance the sport's visibility and growth. Eric Shanks, CEO of Fox Sports, emphasizes the strategic alignment of the Indy 500 within their portfolio of major sporting events.

The 2025 IndyCar schedule remains largely consistent, with minor adjustments to race classifications and locations.

This transition reflects a strategic shift in motorsport broadcasting, focusing on broader, more inclusive coverage to engage a wider audience.
