New Breakthrough in Research on Influenza H3N2 Virus

Over a decade of collaboration between Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chang Gung University, and Johns Hopkins University has unveiled the genetic recombination phenomenon in the H3N2 influenza virus strain. This recombination enhances the virus's replication capabilities and virulence, rendering the human body nearly defenseless against it, leading to a higher risk of severe illness.

Through whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic tree analysis, the study identified significant genetic recombination in the H3N2 virus samples from the 2017-2018 U.S. influenza outbreak. Experiments confirmed that the recombinant H3N2 virus exhibits extremely strong replication capabilities in human nasal epithelial cells, indicating a high risk of severe complications.

The research, integrating artificial intelligence technology, eliminated confounding factors and established a direct link between recombinant viruses and severe illness. The findings were published in "The Lancet Microbe," with significant implications for the development of influenza vaccines and the formulation of public health strategies.

Given the significant rise in severe cases and mortality rates during the 2023-2024 flu season, accurately identifying the virus strain and adjusting vaccine components accordingly are crucial for prevention and control.
