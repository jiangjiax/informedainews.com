Tesla's 2024 shareholder meeting approved Elon Musk's $560 billion compensation package amidst a series of strategic decisions. The board re-elected Kimbal Musk and James Murdoch, strengthening familial and media connections. Cybertruck production reached a record 1,300 units weekly, with customized versions planned for China and the EU. Tesla is increasing Semi production and teasing three new products: a budget Tesla, a robotaxi, and a commercial vehicle or small truck.

Musk emphasized affordability, aiming to make Tesla accessible to the masses. He envisioned a future where Tesla owners could monetize their vehicles through autonomous driving, similar to Airbnb or Uber. Optimus, Tesla's robot, is expected to significantly boost profits, with deployment starting next year.

Musk asserted Tesla's AI superiority over competitors like Meta, Google, and OpenAI, setting the stage for a transformative automotive and tech landscape. The meeting, watched by over a million, highlighted Tesla's ambitious trajectory and Musk's steadfast leadership.
