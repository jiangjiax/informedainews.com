Apple leaps into AI with Apple Intelligence, unveiling iOS 18, iPadOS 18, WatchOS 11, and MacOS 15 (Sequoia). This robust AI framework fuels new features across devices, emphasizing privacy with on-device processing. Siri evolves, integrating conversational context and cross-app actions, akin to Microsoft's Copilot.

Apple partners with OpenAI, integrating ChatGPT-4o for advanced tasks like photorealistic image generation. This collaboration extends to iPhones, iPads, and Macs, enhancing app functionality.

iPadOS 18 mirrors iOS 18's innovations, optimizing for larger screens with enhanced Apple Pencil controls and redesigned core apps. Notably, Apple Pencil now supports Math Notes, solving equations from handwriting.

Apple's strategic move into AI, blending powerful tools with user privacy, positions it competitively against tech giants like Google and Microsoft. This 'new era' for Siri and device interaction could redefine personal computing experiences.
