Dragon Ball Sparking Zero breathes new life into the Budokai Tenkaichi series after a 15-year hiatus, featuring over 160 playable characters, including various iterations of Goku and Vegeta. The game focuses on recreating memorable battles from the Dragon Ball universe, with an Episode Battle mode that lets players re-experience specific fights while making narrative choices.

The gameplay maintains familiar elements from previous Budokai Tenkaichi titles, such as 3D arena combat and unique special moves for each character, while adding new features like team battles involving up to five characters and local multiplayer. Players can also engage in transformations and unleash ultimate abilities, deepening the combat experience.

Although there are minor issues with character tracking and roster complexity, the game offers a nostalgic and immersive experience for Dragon Ball enthusiasts, enabling them to delve into the series' extensive history through dynamic and interactive battles.
