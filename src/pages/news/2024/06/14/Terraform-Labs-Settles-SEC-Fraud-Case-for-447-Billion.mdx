Terraform Labs, a bankrupt cryptocurrency company, and its founder, Do Kwon, have reached a $4.47 billion settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This agreement comes after a jury determined they were responsible for defrauding investors, resulting in a $40 billion loss due to the collapse of TerraUSD and Luna tokens in 2022. The settlement, subject to court approval, involves significant fines and disgorgement, although much of it may remain unpaid due to Terraform's bankruptcy status. Kwon, currently held in Montenegro, faces an $80 million fine and a prohibition from engaging in cryptocurrency transactions. The SEC's goal is to maximize compensation for affected investors and permanently close down Terraform Labs.
