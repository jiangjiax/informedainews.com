British Columbia takes the lead in Canada by establishing a $20.88 hourly wage for gig workers through platforms like Uber and DoorDash. This rate, which is 20% higher than the provincial minimum, applies from the moment a job is accepted until it is completed, excluding any wait times. Tips are kept separate, and the platforms are required to cover any earnings shortfalls.

This initiative tackles the common issue of underpayment, ensuring that workers, who often incur significant vehicle expenses, receive fair remuneration. The policy change comes after consultations with gig workers and platform operators, aiming to strike a balance between maintaining service continuity and protecting worker rights.

Further measures include coverage by WorkSafeBC, increased job transparency, and a vehicle allowance. These reforms are designed to stabilize the gig economy, strengthening worker rights and financial security.
