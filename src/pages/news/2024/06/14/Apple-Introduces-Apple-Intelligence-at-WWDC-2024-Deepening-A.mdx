At WWDC 2024, Apple introduced Apple Intelligence, a generative AI system designed to deeply integrate with users' personal contexts. CEO Tim Cook emphasized its focus on safety and privacy, calling it "personal intelligence."

Apple Intelligence will be central to iOS, macOS, and visionOS, enhancing Siri and integrating with apps like Calendar and Maps. It processes data locally on Apple silicon, with some tasks offloaded to Apple's Private Cloud Compute for privacy.

Siri evolves, now supporting typed queries and deeper app integration through App Intents, improving multitasking and cross-app functionality. Apple also updates emojis with Genmoji and introduces Image Playground for on-device image generation.

Search capabilities expand in Photos and Videos, leveraging natural language for more intuitive interactions. Apple Intelligence rolls out to iPhone 15 Pro, M1 Macs, and iPads, excluding standard iPhone 15 due to chip limitations.

Additionally, Apple partners with OpenAI, integrating ChatGPT into Siri, offering enhanced text and image generation without subscription fees. This integration marks a significant step in AI personalization and utility across Apple's ecosystem.
