Expiration dates often mislead. Trust your senses more. Pamela Vachon, a food and wine expert, recommends using sight, smell, and taste to evaluate edibility. Dates serve as guidelines, not absolutes.

With a background in culinary arts and sommelier certification, Vachon stresses the importance of practical experience over printed dates. Her advice is to engage your senses to prevent food waste.
