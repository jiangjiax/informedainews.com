Mexican soccer star Hirving "Chucky" Lozano, renowned for his championship pedigree, has been announced as the first designated player for Major League Soccer's (MLS) new expansion team, San Diego FC. Lozano, currently playing for PSV Eindhoven, is set to join the team in 2024, with the goal of bringing championships to a city historically lacking in sports victories.

San Diego FC, poised to become MLS's 30th team, is supported by a diverse ownership group that includes Egyptian billionaire Mohamed Mansour and the Sycuan Tribe. Lozano's signing underscores the club's intent to compete at the highest level from its inception, integrating immediate success with long-term player development through its Right To Dream academy.

Lozano's career boasts titles with Pachuca, Napoli, and PSV, showcasing his ability to enhance winning teams. His move to San Diego, near his native Mexico, is anticipated to energize the local fan base, which is already abuzz with "Chucky Mania."

The club's CEO, Tom Penn, recognizes the imperative to build a collection of trophies, noting that Lozano's elite status will spur additional investment in the team's lineup. This strategic decision positions San Diego FC as a formidable contender in MLS, with the aim of reshaping the city's sports scene with a culture of winning.
