Men consume more meat than women, a trend that is particularly evident in developed countries. This dietary gender gap is shaped by societal norms and evolutionary theories. Historically, as hunters, men may be culturally predisposed to eat more meat, whereas women frequently prioritize environmental and ethical considerations in their food choices.

A study encompassing over 28,000 participants from 23 countries validates these trends. It indicates that initiatives aimed at decreasing meat consumption, a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, should target men more specifically. However, the cultural pressures and masculine identity associated with meat consumption present a formidable challenge for change.

Grasping these dynamics is essential for environmental and health campaigns seeking to modify dietary behaviors. The reluctance among men to cut back on meat, despite ethical and environmental concerns, highlights the profound cultural and psychological influences at work.
