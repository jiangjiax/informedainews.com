Pope Francis addressed G7 leaders, urging a ban on autonomous weapons. He emphasized the necessity of human oversight in machine operations, particularly in critical life-and-death decisions. The Pope underscored the dual potential of AI: as a tool for creation or destruction, and for democratization or dominance. His message was unequivocal: the future of humanity depends on our control over technology, not technology controlling us.
