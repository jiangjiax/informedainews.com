BYD, a pioneer in new energy, has reduced carbon emissions by nearly 600 billion kilograms. The equivalent of planting nearly 100 million trees, covering the entire territory of South Korea.

**Decisive Transformation**

Since 2008, BYD has strategically positioned itself across the entire new energy sector. In 2021, it signed a climate agreement to accelerate global electrification. By 2040, the goal is to achieve 100% sales of zero-emission vehicles.

**Historic Decision**

In 2022, BYD ceased production of fuel vehicles, focusing solely on electric vehicles. The first traditional automaker globally to fully embrace new energy.

**Insight**

BYD's transformation is not just a business strategy but a commitment to the future of the planet. Its actions lead the industry and herald the future.
