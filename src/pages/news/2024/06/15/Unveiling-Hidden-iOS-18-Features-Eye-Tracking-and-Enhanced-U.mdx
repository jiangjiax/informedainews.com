WWDC 2024 introduced a plethora of iOS 18 features, though some fascinating enhancements went under the radar. Notably, iPhone and iPad users will now have access to eye tracking technology, facilitating hands-free navigation through gaze. The 'Math Notes' feature, previously exclusive to iPadOS, is now extended to iPhone, enabling users to solve equations using their fingers, albeit without the precision dial of the Apple Pencil Pro.

The flashlight now offers adjustable beam width, and pressing the side buttons initiates bezel animations, which could be a precursor to future iPhones equipped with solid-state buttons. Lastly, sharing Wi-Fi passwords is streamlined with a QR code generated via the new Passwords app.

These features, although not prominently featured at WWDC, significantly enhance the iOS experience, underscoring Apple's dedication to accessibility and user convenience.
