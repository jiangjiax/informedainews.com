Trump proposes a "full tariff" system to replace income tax, aiming to protect domestic industries and reduce corporate taxes. This initiative, if enacted, would overturn more than a century of economic policy that has promoted free trade and progressive taxation. Critics contend that it would place a heavier burden on middle and lower-income Americans while enriching the wealthy.

Under Trump's plan, a 10% tariff would be levied on all imported goods, potentially impacting over $3 trillion in annual imports. This could disrupt global supply chains and lead to higher consumer prices, intensifying inflation. At the same time, Trump advocates for reducing the corporate tax rate to 20%, which would further benefit large corporations.

Despite previous controversies, Trump's re-emergence on Capitol Hill indicates a political reconciliation, with many Republicans now endorsing his policies. His lead in polls against Biden reflects a significant shift in public opinion, which could reshape U.S. fiscal and trade policies.

This policy shift harkens back to 19th-century protectionism, representing a sharp divergence from recent economic standards. The ramifications are extensive, affecting income distribution, international trade dynamics, and domestic economic stability.
