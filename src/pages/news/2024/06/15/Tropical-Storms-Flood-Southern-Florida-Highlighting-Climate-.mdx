Tropical storms in Florida have drenched the southern regions with up to 20 inches of rain, resulting in severe flash flooding. This occurrence aligns with the early June commencement of hurricane season, forecasted to be exceptionally active due to climate change's influence on storm intensity.

The heavy rainfall has caused flight disruptions, vehicle strandings, and home inundations. Tow truck driver Ted Rico depicted the scene as chaotic, with abandoned cars strewn across flooded streets. Airports experienced significant delays and cancellations, affecting travelers such as Navy petty officer Bill Carlisle, who faced extended waits and rerouted flights.

Residents, including Daniela Urrieche and Charlea Johnson, encountered unprecedented flooding in their neighborhoods and homes, with Urrieche observing that this event exceeded the severity of previous hurricanes. The situation highlights the growing challenges presented by extreme weather events, a direct result of climate change.
