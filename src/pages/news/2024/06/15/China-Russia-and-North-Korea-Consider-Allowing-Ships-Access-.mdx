China, Russia, and North Korea may allow ships to navigate the Tumen River into the Sea of Japan, raising security concerns for Tokyo. Currently, Chinese vessels face restrictions due to a bridge and permissions needed from Russia and North Korea. Recent talks between Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin signal a potential shift in allowing access. Russia's reliance on China for trade, amid sanctions, has led to a warming relationship. China aims to widen the river and demolish the bridge for easier transport and economic exchanges. However, this move could impact security, with potential implications for Japan's coast guard activities near disputed territories. Joint military drills and patrols between China and Russia further complicate the situation in the Sea of Japan.
