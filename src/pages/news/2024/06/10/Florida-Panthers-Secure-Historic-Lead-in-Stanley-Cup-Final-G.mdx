In Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Final, the Florida Panthers led from start to finish, marking a historic first for their franchise. Sergei Bobrovsky's outstanding goaltending, along with goals from Carter Verhaeghe, Evan Rodrigues, and Eetu Luostarinen, secured a 3-0 victory over the Edmonton Oilers. This win represents a significant shift for the Panthers, who have traditionally struggled in the final series.

Despite being outshot, the Panthers' aggressive shooting style was overshadowed by Bobrovsky's remarkable saves. This strategic pivot towards a stronger defensive play rather than offensive proved effective. The team's post-game demeanor was notably calm, reflecting their disciplined and focused approach.

Although it's just one win, the Panthers' performance indicates a promising future. The team is now on equal footing in the series, no longer at a disadvantage. The upcoming games will determine if this strategy is sustainable and if the Panthers can keep up their momentum.
