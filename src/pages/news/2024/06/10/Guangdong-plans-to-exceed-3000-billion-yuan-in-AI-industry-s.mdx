Summary:
Guangdong plans to have an AI core industry scale exceeding 300 billion yuan by 2025, with a computing power of 40 EFLOPS. By 2027, the computing power will surpass 60 EFLOPS, establishing a nationwide leading algorithm and computing power network. The focus will be on developing the AI chip ecosystem and intelligent perception industries, promoting independent and controllable large-model products.

Explanation:
- AI Core Industry Scale: Refers to the economic aggregate of the main industries within the field of artificial intelligence.
- Computing Power (EFLOPS): A unit measuring the processing capability of computers, where 1 EFLOPS equals 10^18 floating-point operations per second.
- AI Chip Ecosystem: Refers to the complete industrial chain formed around AI chips, including design, manufacturing, and application.
- Intelligent Perception Industry: Involves industries that utilize sensors and other technologies to achieve environmental perception and data collection.
