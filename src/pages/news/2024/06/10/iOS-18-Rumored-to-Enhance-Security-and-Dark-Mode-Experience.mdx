iOS 18, rumored for unveiling in June 2024, promises enhanced security and usability. Key updates include:

- **App Locking**: Users can secure individual apps like Safari or Mail with Face ID or Touch ID, adding a layer of privacy beyond device unlock.
- **Dark Mode Expansion**: Apple plans to deepen the dark mode experience, offering a more uniform and visually soothing interface across both native and third-party apps.

These features complement broader AI enhancements, notably in Siri, which is set for significant upgrades. Apple's AI initiative, dubbed "Apple Intelligence," aims to integrate machine learning more deeply into apps like Notes and Safari, enhancing functionality and user interaction.

For instance, the Notes app will incorporate audio recording and transcription, alongside AI-powered summarization, making it a versatile tool for capturing and organizing information. Similarly, the Photos app will introduce AI-driven editing tools, allowing for more sophisticated image manipulation.

Overall, iOS 18 reflects Apple's commitment to blending security, aesthetics, and intelligence, aiming to enrich the user experience through thoughtful, integrated design.
