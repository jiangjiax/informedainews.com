In Ljubljana, Slovenia, the Miran Jarc primary school takes pride in its most renowned alumnus, Luka Doncic, who is now a star player for the Dallas Mavericks in the NBA. Doncic started playing basketball at the age of 6 under the guidance of coach Rok Dezman and quickly demonstrated exceptional skills, frequently competing against older opponents. Despite not always having a height advantage, Doncic honed a versatile playing style, specializing in long-range shots and crafty maneuvers in the key.

Doncic's physical education teacher, Uros Rozman, observed his unwavering work ethic, a characteristic that has been a cornerstone of his career. After departing Slovenia to join Real Madrid's youth academy at 13, Doncic's meteoric rise to the NBA has motivated current students at Miran Jarc, who view him as a paragon of diligence and commitment.

Doncic's competitive drive, apparent from his early years, continues to be a defining feature of his game. His triumphant journey acts as a guiding light for budding athletes in Slovenia, underscoring the fact that talent alone is not enough; hard work is essential.
