A fire pit offers more than just warmth and ambiance; it's a versatile tool for outdoor living.

**Repel Mosquitoes:** Burning thyme in your fire pit can ward off mosquitoes, providing up to 90 minutes of protection.

**Cook Over It:** Fire pits are perfect for cooking. Brands like Breeo and Solo Stove offer accessories for grilling, making pizzas, and even popping popcorn.

**Take it Camping:** Portable fire pits, such as the Solo Stove Ranger, are designed for camping, ensuring a controlled fire wherever you go.

**Make a Swedish Torch:** This technique involves stacking wood vertically in the pit, creating a long-lasting, intense heat source, ideal for winter.

**Reuse the Ashes:** Instead of discarding them, utilize fire pit ashes as a natural fertilizer for your garden.

Embrace these uses to transform your fire pit into a multi-functional asset for outdoor enjoyment.
