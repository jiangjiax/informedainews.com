Researchers utilized GPT-4 to uncover and exploit previously unknown "zero-day" vulnerabilities, successfully compromising over half of the tested websites. This approach, which employs autonomous bots, outperforms traditional single-agent methods by a staggering 550%. Despite concerns, GPT-4, when operating in chatbot mode, does not possess the comprehension necessary to independently exploit these vulnerabilities.
