Microsoft Edge introduces AI-powered workspaces, tailored to Bing searches. This experimental feature automatically populates a workspace with relevant tabs for tasks like recipes or DIY projects, ensuring privacy by not storing search data. To activate, enable the feature and restart Edge.

- **Edge Workspaces**: A shared browser session feature, now AI-enhanced to curate relevant websites based on search queries.
- **AI-generated workspaces**: AI in Bing suggests and opens multiple relevant sites in a dedicated workspace, triggered by specific search queries.
