In Montreal, a foundry transforms scrap copper into usable rods, essential for meeting the growing demand for electricity. As the world transitions to clean energy, the demand for copper is projected to nearly double by 2035. Recycling copper saves 200 tons of rock per ton of metal, significantly reducing the environmental impact of mining. Copper, which can be recycled indefinitely without degradation, is crucial; without it, our electricity-dependent society would struggle.

Aluminum, another conductive material, requires substantial energy to produce, making copper increasingly attractive as energy costs escalate. Two-thirds of the copper produced in the last century is still in use, indicating a substantial future recycling potential. Embracing this "urban mine" not only enhances the supply of copper but also minimizes the need for new mining, thereby reducing its environmental impact.
