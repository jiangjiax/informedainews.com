On the final day of European Parliament elections, hundreds of millions queue to vote, shaping the continent's political landscape. These pivotal elections, especially significant since Brexit, will determine the 720 lawmakers in the EU's transnational parliament. Predictions suggest a shift towards the radical and far-right, although mainstream pro-European groups are expected to maintain a majority.

The European Parliament, which once served primarily as a forum for discussion, now holds substantial legislative power over critical areas such as climate action and AI. The outcome of these elections will also influence Ursula von der Leyen's chances for a second term as European Commission President.

Germany's Greens, facing controversies over domestic climate laws, and France's Macron-led centrists, currently lagging behind Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally, are at risk of significant losses. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's growing influence could reshape the political blocs, possibly strengthening a more unified right-wing faction.

The turnout, especially among the youth, is closely monitored, with recent initiatives aimed at engaging younger voters yielding promising results. As the polls close, the EU's future trajectory remains uncertain, heavily dependent on the results of these elections.
