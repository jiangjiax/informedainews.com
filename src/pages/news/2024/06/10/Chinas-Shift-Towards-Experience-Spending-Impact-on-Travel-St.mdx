China's consumers are shifting spending towards experiences, notably travel. Meituan, a leading food delivery platform, reports increased travel budgets among consumers, despite economic sluggishness. This mirrors post-pandemic U.S. trends where experience spending remained robust.

Meituan's hotel and travel bookings surged, prompting HSBC to raise its stock price target. Similarly, Bank of America Securities and Goldman Sachs highlight H World, a hotel operator, as poised to benefit from this trend, with Goldman Sachs setting a $52 price target.

Inbound tourism to China is also growing, with Morgan Stanley predicting an 11% annual increase through 2033. Domestic hotel bookings on Meituan have surpassed pre-pandemic levels, indicating a strong recovery in the travel sector.
