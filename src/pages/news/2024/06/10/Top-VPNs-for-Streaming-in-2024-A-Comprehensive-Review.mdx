Best VPN for Streaming in 2024 - CNET Summary

CNET experts, Attila Tomaschek and Moe Long, rigorously tested VPNs for streaming in 2024. Their top pick, ExpressVPN, excels in privacy, security, and streaming capabilities. Despite being pricey, it offers robust features like a kill switch and split tunneling, making it user-friendly across various devices.

ExpressVPN stands out for its ability to access international streaming content with minimal speed loss. It unblocked foreign libraries of Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video, and Netflix during tests. However, it only supports eight simultaneous connections and has a higher cost compared to competitors.

Another notable choice is NordVPN, praised for its blazing-fast speeds and strong privacy features. It performed well in unblocking streaming services and showed minimal speed reduction during tests.

Both VPNs are effective tools for accessing geo-restricted content, enhancing privacy, and maintaining decent internet speeds while streaming.

Explanation:
- VPN (Virtual Private Network): A service that encrypts your internet connection and routes it through a server in another location, masking your IP address and enhancing privacy.
- Kill Switch: A feature that prevents network data from leaking outside of the secure VPN tunnel if the VPN connection fails.
- Split Tunneling: Allows some traffic to go through the VPN while other traffic bypasses it, enhancing speed and access to local network devices.
