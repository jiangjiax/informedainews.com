Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's far-right Brothers of Italy party secured a robust 28% in European elections, affirming its lead in Italian politics and enhancing Meloni's influence in Europe. The party's gains, up from 26% in 2022, contrast sharply with the decline of Matteo Salvini's League, which plummeted to 8.5%. Meloni's victory positions her as a pivotal figure amidst the rise of far-right parties across the EU, challenging mainstream leaders like Macron and Scholz. Her government, despite Italy's fiscal fragility, emerges strengthened, uniquely maintaining public support in a European context. Meloni's party is projected to nearly quadruple its representation in the European Parliament, from six to 23-25 seats, marking a significant shift in European political dynamics.
