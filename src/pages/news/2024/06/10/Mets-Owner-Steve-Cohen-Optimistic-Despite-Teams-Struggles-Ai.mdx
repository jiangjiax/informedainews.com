New York Mets owner Steve Cohen remains optimistic despite the team's subpar performance, currently nine games below .500. Speaking in London, Cohen emphasized the need for focus on the present rather than the upcoming trade deadline. He praised the front office, led by David Stearns, and manager Carlos Mendoza, noting improvements in institutional decision-making.

Cohen acknowledged the Mets' struggles but highlighted moments of promise, expressing confidence in the team's potential to improve. He dismissed concerns about jet lag affecting performance, comparing the Mets' situation to that of the Philadelphia Phillies, who played unaffected.

The Mets, despite a disappointing season, are aiming for a turnaround, with Cohen believing in the team's ability to gain momentum and confidence. His message to fans: resilience, reminding them that they've endured tougher times.
