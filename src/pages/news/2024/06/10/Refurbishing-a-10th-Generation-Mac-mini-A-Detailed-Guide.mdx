Restoring a 10th generation Mac mini, specifically the 2009 2.26 Core Duo 2-based model, requires careful disassembly and attention to detail. This model, known for its polycarbonate and aluminum shell, differs from earlier minis with internal improvements that simplify refurbishment.

Tools needed include a spackling tool, screwdrivers, a spudger, scissors, compressed air, and a flashlight. The process begins by opening the case with the spackling tool, then removing the DVD-R drive and its associated components. Later models feature a lighter, quieter DVD drive, though with slower access times.

Next, remove the drive carrier by unscrewing it from the base. This step reveals the motherboard and other internal components, which require careful handling to avoid damage.

Refurbishing these older Mac minis can breathe new life into them, making them functional and efficient despite their age. However, the process demands precision and patience, suitable only for those confident in their technical abilities.
