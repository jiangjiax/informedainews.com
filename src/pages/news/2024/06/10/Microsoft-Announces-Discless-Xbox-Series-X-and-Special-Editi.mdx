Microsoft unveils a discless Xbox Series X, referred to as the "all digital edition," priced at $450, marking a $50 decrease from its disc-equipped counterpart. This new model, featuring a robot white exterior, matches the original's 1TB SSD capacity, indicating a move towards digital-only gaming.

Concurrently, Microsoft introduces a Galaxy Black Special Edition of the Series X, characterized by a striking speckled black finish, a green base plate, and a doubled storage capacity of 2TB. Priced at $600, it aligns with the cost of standard models that include additional storage.

The Series S also undergoes an update, retaining its white exterior while matching the black edition's 1TB storage, with no change in price at $350. All three consoles are scheduled for release during the 2024 holiday season, reflecting Microsoft's strategy to diversify its offerings and accommodate different consumer preferences in gaming.
