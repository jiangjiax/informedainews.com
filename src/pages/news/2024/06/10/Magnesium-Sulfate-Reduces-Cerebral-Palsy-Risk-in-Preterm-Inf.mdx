Magnesium sulfate, a simple compound, now shields very preterm infants from cerebral palsy and death. A recent study confirms its protective powers.

Cerebral palsy, a neurological disorder, impairs movement and coordination. It often results from brain damage in early development. Preterm birth, before 37 weeks, heightens this risk.

The study reveals that magnesium sulfate, when administered to pregnant women at risk of early delivery, significantly reduces the incidence of cerebral palsy in their infants. It also lowers mortality rates among these vulnerable babies.

This treatment, straightforward and effective, offers hope. It's a clear victory in the complex battle against the challenges of premature birth.
