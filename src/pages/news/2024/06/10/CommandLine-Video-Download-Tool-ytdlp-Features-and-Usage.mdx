The tool handles extractors, which are mechanisms for pulling data from various sites, using `--use-extractors` and `--default-search`. For live streams, it includes features like `--live-from-start` and `--wait-for-video`. Output formatting is managed by `--color`, and compatibility is ensured with `--compat-options`.

Essentially, yt-dlp is a robust tool for video downloads, tailored for users proficient with the command line.
