Japanese musicians are increasingly performing in China, as live events rebound post-COVID-19. Chinese promoters, seeking cost-effective talent, favor Japanese artists like Yoasobi and King Gnu, who command lower fees than local stars. This trend benefits both sides: Chinese events gain fresh appeal, while Japanese artists expand their fan base and revenue in China.

Yoasobi, a Japanese music sensation, captivated audiences at the Bubbling & Boiling Music & Arts Festival in Tianjin. Their performance, featuring a call-and-response in Chinese and Japanese, highlighted the enthusiasm for Japanese acts. Fans eagerly purchased merchandise, underscoring the duo's popularity.

This influx of Japanese artists reflects a strategic move by Chinese promoters to invigorate their events with international flair, capitalizing on the lower costs associated with Japanese talent. The Japanese artists, in turn, benefit from exposure to a vast Chinese market, enhancing their global presence.

The rise in live performances and music festivals in China, as evidenced by the growth in entertainment event revenues, signals a robust recovery in the entertainment sector. This trend not only enriches the cultural exchange between Japan and China but also demonstrates the adaptability of the music industry in leveraging global talent to meet local demands.
