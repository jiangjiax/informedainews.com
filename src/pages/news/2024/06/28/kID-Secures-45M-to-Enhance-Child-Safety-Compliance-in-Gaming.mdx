k-ID secures $45M to streamline child safety compliance for game developers. The startup, backed by Andreessen Horowitz and Lightspeed Venture Partners, aims to simplify adherence to evolving global regulations.

Game developers face a daunting task: crafting engaging games while navigating complex child safety laws. k-ID's platform, accessible via APIs or SDKs, automates compliance, adjusting game features to meet local requirements. It offers single sign-on for children, parental controls via QR codes, and customizable access based on age and region.

This funding underscores a critical need in the gaming industry, as developers increasingly target a global, younger audience. k-ID's solution not only eases regulatory burdens but also enhances parental oversight, ensuring games are both fun and safe.

The partnership with ESRB for Privacy Certified Kids Seal further legitimizes k-ID's commitment to privacy and safety in gaming. As regulations continue to evolve, tools like k-ID are essential for developers striving to balance creativity with compliance.
