The inaugural 2024 general election debate presents a historic showdown between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, marking the first instance where a sitting president confronts a former one prior to accepting party nominations. This debate, taking place at CNN’s Atlanta studios on Thursday at 9 p.m. ET, will be moderated by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Dana Bash and will be broadcast live on CNN and other networks. Notably, Georgia, once a Republican stronghold, has transformed into a critical battleground state. Trump faces an indictment in Georgia stemming from his attempts to reverse Biden’s 2020 victory.

Initially, Biden’s campaign aimed to exclude third-party candidates. However, under debate commission rules, they may participate if they achieve ballot access for 270 Electoral Votes and poll at 15% or higher. CNN and ABC established a 15% threshold in four national polls for debate inclusion. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a potential third-party candidate, did not meet these criteria.

Both Biden and Trump bypassed primary debates, making this their first appearance in this election cycle. Biden initially declined to participate in traditional fall presidential debates but later accepted CNN’s invitation. Trump, keen on the debate, confirmed his participation via social media.

The subsequent debate, hosted by ABC on September 10, will be moderated by David Muir and Linsey Davis. Vice President Kamala Harris is scheduled to debate her Republican counterpart in July or August, hosted by CBS News.
