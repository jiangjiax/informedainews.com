NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, after sampling asteroid Bennu, discovered traces of magnesium-sodium phosphate—a compound typically associated with Earth's minerals and biological processes. This finding suggests that Bennu may have originated from a primitive ocean world, hinting at a watery past.

Bennu, a rare B-type asteroid, is carbonaceous and contains water-bearing minerals. The sample analysis revealed magnesium-bearing phyllosilicates, such as serpentine and smectite, which are common rocks found in Earth's mid-ocean ridges. These findings provide insights into Bennu's aqueous origins.

Despite surface alterations, Bennu still retains ancient characteristics from the early solar system, including a rich composition of carbon, nitrogen, and organic compounds—essential ingredients for life. This discovery not only expands our understanding of asteroid composition but also raises intriguing questions about the potential conditions for life beyond Earth.
