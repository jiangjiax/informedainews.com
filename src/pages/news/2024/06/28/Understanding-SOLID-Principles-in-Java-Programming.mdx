SOLID principles guide object-oriented programming, ensuring code efficiency and maintainability. Each letter represents a key principle:

**Single Responsibility**: A class should have one, and only one, reason to change. For example, an `Employee` class that handles emails violates this by deviating from its primary responsibilities.

**Open/Closed**: Software entities should be open to extension but closed to modification. A class like `AreaCalculator` that requires changes for new shapes contradicts this. Instead, an interface like `IAreaCalculator` should be used for extensibility.

**Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes must be interchangeable with their base types. A `Bird` class with subclasses `Eagle` and `Ostrich` fails if `Ostrich` cannot truly fly. Separating flying and non-flying birds resolves this issue.

**Interface Segregation**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. An interface like `IShapeAreaCalculator` that requires `Square` to implement volume methods is inefficient. Segregating interfaces according to specific needs improves this.

**Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. An `Employee` class directly using `EmailNotification` is inflexible. By depending on a `Notification` interface, flexibility is ensured.

Adhering to SOLID principles results in software that is robust, adaptable, and easy to maintain.
