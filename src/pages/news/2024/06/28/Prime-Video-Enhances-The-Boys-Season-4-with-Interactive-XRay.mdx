'The Boys' Season 4 on Prime Video introduces an interactive feature called X-Ray, enhancing viewer engagement. This tool, powered by IMDB, provides instant access to actor details, music credits, and trivia without interrupting the viewing experience.

X-Ray proves particularly useful for superfans, offering insights like improvised lines and background information on cast members. For instance, it revealed that Rob Benedict, known for his role in a memorable sauna scene, studied Shakespeare.

To access X-Ray's trivia, simply activate it during playback by tapping or clicking. After watching an episode, delve deeper into the "trivia" tab to explore each nugget and even jump back to relevant scenes for context.

This feature not only enriches the viewing experience but also saves time on external searches, keeping the focus on the show's dark, satirical narrative.
