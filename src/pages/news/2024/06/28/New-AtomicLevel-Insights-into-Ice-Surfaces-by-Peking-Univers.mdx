For over 170 years, the structure of ice surfaces has puzzled scientists. A team from Peking University, led by Professors Jiang Ying and Wang Enge, has now unveiled these mysteries at the atomic level. Inspired by the frozen surface of Peking University's Weiming Lake, the team utilized advanced scanning probe techniques to visualize the atomic structure of hexagonal ice.

Key Discoveries:
- Ice Surface Complexity: Contrary to the long-held belief of a uniform structure, the ice surface is a mosaic of two stacking patterns, Ih and Ic, creating a "perfect imperfection."
- Premelting at Lower Temperatures: The team discovered that ice begins to pre-melt at 120K, significantly lower than the previously accepted 200K, indicating that natural ice surfaces are frequently in a disordered, near-liquid state.
- Technological Breakthroughs: The development of a new CO-tip technology and a domestically produced qPlus scanning microscope enabled unprecedented clarity in imaging insulating ice surfaces.

Impact:
These findings revolutionize our understanding of ice behavior, influencing fields ranging from materials science to atmospheric chemistry. The ability to visualize and comprehend the atomic structure of ice surfaces opens new avenues for research into ice's role in planetary science and the origins of life.

Future Directions:
The team intends to integrate advanced technologies such as femtosecond lasers and AI with scanning probe microscopy to explore the elusive dynamics of water molecules, pushing the frontiers of current scientific knowledge.

This research not only enhances our scientific toolkit but also highlights the power of interdisciplinary approaches in addressing complex scientific challenges.
