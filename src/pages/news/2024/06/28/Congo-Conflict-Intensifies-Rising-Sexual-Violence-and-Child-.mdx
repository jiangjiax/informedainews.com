Conflict in Congo's east has intensified, marked by surges in sexual violence, child recruitment, and civilian casualties. The Red Cross reports a 90% increase in sexual assaults in Goma, with women resorting to carrying condoms to mitigate the consequences of rape. Child recruitment has risen by an estimated 80%, driven by the need to replace combatants in escalating battles. The ICRC supports hospitals that are overwhelmed, treating a third of last year's caseload in just one month. The use of sophisticated weapons in urban areas has led to more civilian injuries, with shrapnel wounds becoming common. Despite the grim statistics, the ICRC's budget for Congo remains significantly underfunded, at just 22% of the required 85 million Swiss francs.
