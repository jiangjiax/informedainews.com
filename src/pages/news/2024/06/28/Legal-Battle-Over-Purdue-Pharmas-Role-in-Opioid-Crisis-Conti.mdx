The Sackler family, owners of Purdue Pharma, the company behind OxyContin, are under legal scrutiny for their part in the opioid crisis. Purdue Pharma, established in 1952, heavily promoted OxyContin, a potent prescription pain reliever, which resulted in widespread addiction and overdose fatalities. Although initially claiming low addiction risk, OxyContin's high potency and potential for abuse significantly contributed to the crisis.

Recently, the Supreme Court rejected a bankruptcy settlement that aimed to protect the Sacklers from additional civil lawsuits while funding initiatives to tackle the opioid epidemic. The proposed agreement involved a $6 billion contribution from the family and the transformation of Purdue Pharma into a public benefits corporation, with profits being channeled towards addressing the crisis.

Once celebrated philanthropists, the Sacklers have had their name stripped from various institutions due to public outcry. Despite legal strategies and settlements, the family denies any responsibility for the crisis. This ongoing situation highlights the intricate relationship between corporate profits, public health, and legal responsibility.
