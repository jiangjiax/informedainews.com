Accessibility in web development involves designing websites that are usable by everyone, including individuals with disabilities. This is essential for promoting inclusivity, enhancing user experience, and meeting legal requirements.

Key practices include:
- Semantic HTML: Utilizing tags such as `<header>` and `<main>` to enhance clarity.
- Keyboard Navigation: Ensuring all site functionalities are accessible without a mouse.
- Accessible Forms: Clearly labeling form inputs.
- Color Contrast: Ensuring readability through appropriate contrast ratios.
- Responsive Design: Adapting the site layout to various devices.
- Alt Text for Images: Providing descriptions for images to assist visually impaired users.
- Regular Testing: Employing tools like Lighthouse to assess accessibility.

By following these practices, developers ensure that websites are not only legally compliant but also ethically responsible, creating a digital environment that is accessible to all.
