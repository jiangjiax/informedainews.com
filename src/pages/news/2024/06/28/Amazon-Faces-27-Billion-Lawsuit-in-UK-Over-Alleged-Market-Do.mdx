Amazon is embroiled in a new legal dispute in the UK, facing accusations of exploiting its market dominance. More than 200,000 third-party sellers are demanding £27 billion in damages, claiming that Amazon has unfairly promoted its own products and services, thereby distorting competition. The lawsuit, spearheaded by Professor Andreas Stephan, contends that Amazon's practices, such as the requirement to use its Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) service for Prime eligibility, have put sellers at a disadvantage, increasing costs and diminishing sales.

This legal challenge comes after years of scrutiny by UK and EU regulators regarding Amazon's handling of seller data and market conduct. Similar allegations have surfaced in the US, where Amazon has confronted several antitrust lawsuits. Despite recent settlements with regulatory bodies, these agreements have not involved financial penalties, leading sellers to pursue direct compensation through legal means.

The case highlights broader concerns about the influence wielded by tech giants and the necessity for strong antitrust enforcement to uphold fair market practices.
