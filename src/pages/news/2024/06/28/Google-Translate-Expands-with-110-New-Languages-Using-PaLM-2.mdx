Google Translate has expanded to include 110 additional languages, powered by the PaLM 2 AI. This update notably includes Cantonese and numerous African languages, extending coverage to an additional 614 million speakers. A significant highlight is the revival of the Manx language. The challenges lie in navigating the diverse dialects and non-standard forms of these languages. This aligns with Google's objective to support up to 1,000 languages.
