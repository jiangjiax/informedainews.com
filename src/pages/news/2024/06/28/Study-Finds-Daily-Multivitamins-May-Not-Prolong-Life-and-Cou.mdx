Daily multivitamins, often seen as a health boost, may not prolong life and could even hasten death, a significant study reveals. Analyzing health records of nearly 400,000 disease-free adults over two decades, researchers found no longevity benefit and a slight increase in mortality among multivitamin users.

The study, led by Dr. Erikka Loftfield at the National Cancer Institute, suggests a 4% higher mortality risk initially among users. This could be due to the harmful effects of certain supplements or the tendency of ill individuals to start multivitamins.

Despite the multivitamin market's billions, experts warn of potential harm. For instance, while natural beta-carotene protects against cancer, its supplements can increase risks of lung cancer and heart disease. Iron supplements, common in multivitamins, can lead to overload and increase risks of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and dementia.

Dr. Neal Barnard, commenting on the study, highlights that vitamins are beneficial in specific cases but notes, "multivitamins overpromise and underdeliver." He emphasizes the importance of a healthy diet over supplements.

Duane Mellor, a dietitian, adds that supplements can fill gaps in nutrient-poor diets but cannot substitute for a balanced diet. He suggests specific supplements like vitamin D for UK adults in winter or vitamin B12 for vegans and vegetarians.

In essence, multivitamins do not support longevity and may pose risks. A balanced diet remains the cornerstone of health.
