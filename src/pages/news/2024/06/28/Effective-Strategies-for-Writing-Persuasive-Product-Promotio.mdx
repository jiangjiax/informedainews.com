The core of writing copy for product promotion lies in matching supply with demand. First, identify why users choose your product: what needs it addresses, such as emotional, educational, or social needs. Next, highlight the product's selling points, explaining how it meets these needs. Finally, emphasize the product's uniqueness, such as brand endorsement or professional formulation, to enhance user trust.

**Scenario-Driven Copywriting**

Start with specific scenarios to consider how the product meets particular needs. For example, when writing copy for a Dragon Boat Festival zongzi gift box, consider the corporate welfare scenario, emphasizing the box's appearance, variety of flavors, and customization services to meet both the need for prestige and diverse choices.

**Versatility of the Product Promotion Mindset**

The product promotion mindset is not limited to products or formats. Whether it's a short video, article, or live stream, the key is to adjust the content structure and language style according to the platform's characteristics, but the core—the match between demand and supply—remains constant.

**Personal Insights**

The success of product promotion copy lies in deeply understanding and meeting user needs, while skillfully showcasing the product's uniqueness. By thinking in terms of scenarios, the copy can more effectively resonate with people and facilitate purchasing decisions.
