South Africa's ruling party, the African National Congress (ANC), which has been in power since 1994, has lost its parliamentary majority. The party secured 159 of the 400 seats in the National Assembly, marking the first time this has occurred since Nelson Mandela led them to victory in the country's inaugural multiracial elections.

Public dissatisfaction with corruption, economic stagnation, and worsening security has eroded support for the ANC. President Cyril Ramaphosa has acknowledged the voice of the electorate and signaled his readiness to engage in coalition talks.

The ANC is now faced with negotiations with the Democratic Alliance, a party led by white politicians, as well as other parties, including a faction associated with former President Jacob Zuma. The results of these discussions will be pivotal in determining the political stability of South Africa.
