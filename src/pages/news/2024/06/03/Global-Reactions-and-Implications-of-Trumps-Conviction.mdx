Donald Trump's conviction on 34 felony counts in a New York court has global implications. Although the world does not vote in U.S. elections, it closely watches as Trump's legal battles could affect his potential return to the presidency. His conviction sparks questions about his eligibility to run and its impact on his support base.

Internationally, right-wing leaders such as Viktor Orban of Hungary and Matteo Salvini of Italy defend Trump, viewing the trial as politically motivated. Russian President Putin uses the situation to criticize American democracy, implying the U.S. is not qualified to lecture others on the rule of law.

The verdict comes at a time of critical global issues, including the Ukraine war, European defense concerns, and Asian security amid rising tensions with China. Trump's unpredictable foreign policy approach, including questioning defense commitments to NATO and South Korea, worries allies.

In Germany, there is significant anxiety about a possible Trump presidency due to his previous criticism of the country. In contrast, Poland's Prime Minister Tusk views the conviction as a lesson in judicial independence.

Most foreign governments respond cautiously, acknowledging the sensitivity of commenting on U.S. domestic affairs. The outcome of the U.S. election will greatly influence international relations, with allies hoping for stability and adherence to established defense treaties.
