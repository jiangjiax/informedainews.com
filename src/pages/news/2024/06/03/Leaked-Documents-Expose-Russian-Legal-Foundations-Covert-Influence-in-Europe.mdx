**Summary:**
Leaked documents expose the Fund for Support and Protection of the Rights of Compatriots Living Abroad (Pravfond), a Russian state-backed legal foundation, as a covert Kremlin influence operation active in 48 countries. Established in 2012, Pravfond utilizes millions in state subsidies to fund propaganda and legal campaigns, including the defense of convicted criminals such as Viktor Bout and Vadim Krasikov. The foundation is staffed by former intelligence officers and maintains ties with Russian military intelligence units, demonstrating a strategic use of "soft power" to sway European affairs.

**Insights:**
Pravfond showcases Russia's adept use of soft power, a term denoting non-military methods of influence, through legal and propaganda avenues. By financing legal defenses and propaganda websites, Russia capitalizes on its diaspora and strategic narratives to mold perceptions and policies across Europe. This approach raises serious concerns about the integrity of European legal systems and the potential manipulation of public opinion, especially in light of the upcoming European Parliament elections. The disclosure highlights the necessity for increased vigilance against such clandestine influence operations.
