"World of Warcraft" (WoW) is set to integrate with Battle.net, Blizzard's online gaming service, starting June 3-5, with maintenance potentially disrupting player access. The "Wrath of the Lich King" classic version will begin technical testing, paving the way for its official relaunch.

On June 6, at 10 AM, more details about WoW's re-entry into the Chinese market will be revealed. Last year, when the Chinese server shut down, a game progress archive service, known as the "digital coffin," was introduced to safeguard player data. This archive, created for the game's eventual comeback, will now be employed.

In April, Blizzard Entertainment and NetEase renewed their long-standing partnership, spanning over 15 years, to relaunch Blizzard games in China, starting this summer.

This integration and relaunch represent a strategic move by Blizzard to reconnect with its Chinese audience, using nostalgia and preserved player data to reignite interest in WoW.
