Jocelyn Erickson's four RBIs propelled Florida past Alabama, 6-4, securing a spot in the Women's College World Series semifinals. Erickson, a former national champion with Oklahoma, now faces her old team in a high-stakes match. Florida, seeded fourth, must defeat Oklahoma twice to reach the championship series; Oklahoma needs just one win to advance.

Erickson's performance was pivotal, breaking the school's single-season RBI record with 84, surpassing Megan Bush's 80 in 2011. Florida's Korbe Otis and Ariel Kowalewski contributed with two hits each, while pitcher Keagan Rothrock, despite a challenging previous game, led with 32 wins nationally.

Alabama, despite a ninth-place regular-season finish in the SEC, showed resilience, winning their regional and defeating higher-seeded teams. Coach Patrick Murphy praised their tenacity, emphasizing the team's enduring spirit.

The game was delayed three hours due to weather, yet Florida's resolve remained unshaken. Erickson's decisive home run in the sixth sealed the victory, setting the stage for a compelling semifinal against Oklahoma.

This matchup not only tests Florida's mettle but also challenges Oklahoma's bid for a historic fourth consecutive national title. The stage is set for a dramatic showdown, where past loyalties and future legacies collide.
