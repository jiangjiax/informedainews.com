Corridor care, where patients are treated in hospital hallways due to bed shortages, has become routine despite its risks. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) deems it a "national emergency." Their survey reveals that one in three nurses have cared for patients in unsuitable areas like corridors and waiting rooms. This practice compromises patient privacy, dignity, and access to basic needs and medical equipment.

The Conservatives argue that increased NHS funding and new diagnostic centers alleviate pressure, while Labour and the Liberal Democrats criticize years of neglect and propose reforms. The RCN demands reporting of corridor care to address this issue nationwide.

This crisis underscores a critical need for systemic healthcare reform, prioritizing patient safety and dignity.
