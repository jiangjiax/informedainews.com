Donald Trump, convicted in a hush-money trial, claims the ordeal is "very hard" on his wife, Melania. The trial, which found Trump guilty of falsifying business records related to payments made to Stormy Daniels, a former adult film actress, marks a historic first for a U.S. president. Trump, maintaining the trial was rigged, spoke on Fox News, vowing electoral "revenge" in November.

The trial's details, including allegations of a sexual encounter with Daniels, have reportedly strained the Trump family. Trump acknowledges potential imprisonment, though it's unlikely, and suggests public backlash would be severe. Meanwhile, Daniels, in her first post-trial comments, expressed shock at the verdict's swiftness and advocated for Trump's sentencing, adding a sardonic suggestion for his community service.

Despite this conviction, Trump faces multiple ongoing legal challenges, including allegations of election interference in Georgia and mishandling of classified documents in Florida. The trials for these cases are either delayed or in appeals, complicating Trump's legal landscape further.

**Insight:**
Trump's conviction, a first in presidential history, underscores the legal and personal complexities of his post-presidency. His assertion that the trial impacts his family more than himself reflects a common tactic of deflecting personal responsibility. Meanwhile, Daniels' response highlights the enduring impact of such scandals on all parties involved, suggesting a prolonged public and legal battle ahead.
