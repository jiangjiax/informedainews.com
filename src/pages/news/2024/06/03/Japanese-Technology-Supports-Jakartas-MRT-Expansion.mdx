In Jakarta, beneath the city's congested streets, workers are expanding the Japan-backed MRT system, with the goal of easing transportation issues by 2030. The extension of 5.8 kilometers to the North-South Line, stretching from Bundaran HI to Kota, utilizes Japanese engineering, tailored for Jakarta's soft soil conditions.

Sumitomo Mitsui Construction, supported by JICA, leads the effort, advancing tunneling technologies to prevent water leakage and manage wastewater. The project, currently 51% complete, also involves Japanese companies Shimizu and Sojitz, ensuring high-quality execution.

Jakarta, home to over 10 million residents, faces inadequate public transport, resulting in economic losses due to traffic congestion. The government, acknowledging this issue, is quickly developing infrastructure, including a high-speed railway with Chinese assistance.

Japan, on the other hand, is providing financial and technological support, recently announcing a $900 million loan for a second MRT line, the East-West Line, slated to start construction in 2025. This initiative highlights Japan's dedication to maintaining a competitive edge in infrastructure technology, despite China's increasing influence.

The MRT expansion not only seeks to enhance Jakarta's transportation but also aims to transfer Japanese construction expertise to Indonesian workers, promoting local skills and technological autonomy.
