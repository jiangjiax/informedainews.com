A new drug, pembrolizumab (Keytruda), shows promise in treating bowel cancer with a specific genetic flaw. In a study, 32 patients with stage two or three bowel cancer, characterized by a high number of genetic mutations, received nine weeks of this immunotherapy instead of chemotherapy before surgery. Remarkably, 59% of these patients were cancer-free after treatment, and the rest had significantly reduced tumors. Typically, less than 5% of such patients show no cancer signs post-surgery.

Pembrolizumab works by blocking a protein on cells, prompting them to attack cancer cells. This approach not only reduces the need for surgery and chemotherapy but also enhances survival rates. Dr. Kai-Keen Shiu, the trial's chief investigator, noted that complete response to this treatment triples survival chances.

The drug is already used for various cancers, including lung, head, neck, and certain breast cancers. About 15% of bowel cancer patients could benefit from pembrolizumab, potentially impacting a significant number of the 900,000 annual deaths from bowel cancer, the second most deadly type.

The trial continues, focusing on long-term survival and relapse rates, offering hope for a more effective, less invasive treatment for a subset of bowel cancer patients.
