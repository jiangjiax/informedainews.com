Nvidia, a leading maker of AI chips, has soared to a staggering $3 trillion market value, surpassing Apple to become the world's second most valuable company. This milestone reflects a significant shift in the tech landscape, where Apple, once dominant with the iPhone, now faces stiff competition.

Nvidia's stock surged 147% in 2024, driven by overwhelming demand for its high-end processors. Major tech players like Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet are aggressively expanding their AI capabilities, fueling this demand. In contrast, Apple struggles with declining iPhone sales and fierce competition in China's smartphone market.

The tech world is rapidly pivoting towards AI, and Nvidia, with its cutting-edge technology, is at the forefront. This surge in value underscores a broader trend where AI is not just a feature but a core driver of growth in the tech industry.
