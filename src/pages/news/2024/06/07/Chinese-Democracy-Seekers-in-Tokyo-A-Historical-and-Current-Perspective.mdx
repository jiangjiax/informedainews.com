In Tokyo, a new generation of Chinese democracy seekers gathers, echoing the historical ties between the two nations. The city, once the cradle of China's 1911 Revolution, now hosts Chinese residents advocating for democracy in mainland China and Hong Kong. The influx of Chinese migrants to Japan, seeking refuge from China's surveillance society and economic stagnation, is on the rise. Many bring wealth, investing in Japanese real estate for stability. Tokyo's significance in Chinese revolutionary history is highlighted by the formation of the Tongmenghui in 1905, a pivotal moment in China's path to revolution. Despite the Chinese Communist Party's reluctance to acknowledge Tokyo's role in history, the legacy of Chinese revolutionaries like Sun Yat-sen lives on in the city. A recent memorial in Tokyo commemorated the 35th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown, honoring the victims of the 1989 tragedy.
