On the 29th National Eye Care Day, a significant advancement in medical AI was announced. The collaboration between Sun Yat-sen University's Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center and Huawei has yielded ChatZOC, an AI-powered ophthalmic model.

Launched by Zhongshan Ophthalmic in March 2023 and co-developed with Huawei by December, ChatZOC leverages a vast knowledge base of eye diseases, extensive data from Zhongshan Ophthalmic, and the latest medical literature. Powered by Huawei's AI framework, it employs sophisticated techniques such as parameter fine-tuning and enhanced generation, enabling it to process complex data and tasks with precision.

This model not only elevates the scientific accuracy of ophthalmic knowledge queries to an international standard but also enhances patient care in digital hospitals. ChatZOC offers round-the-clock eye health consultations, boosting service efficiency by 75% compared to traditional methods.

In essence, ChatZOC represents a leap in AI's integration with healthcare, particularly in ophthalmology, by significantly improving both the quality and efficiency of patient services.
