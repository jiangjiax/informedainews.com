Nvidia, a U.S. semiconductor company, has ascended to the position of the world's second-most valuable company, surpassing Apple. This leap is fueled by a surge in demand for chips that drive artificial intelligence.

On Wednesday, Nvidia's stock price surged over 5% on the Nasdaq, closing at $1,224. This surge propelled the company's valuation beyond $3 trillion for the first time, making it the third entity to reach this milestone, following Apple and Microsoft.

Nvidia's financial performance is equally impressive, with net profits multiplying more than seven times compared to the same period last year.
