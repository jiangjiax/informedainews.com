President Biden, confronted with a historic surge in migrants, has invoked a provision of the asylum law previously favored by Trump to temporarily halt asylum at the southern border. This action suspends the longstanding right of migrants to seek protection upon setting foot on U.S. soil. Biden cited a global migrant crisis as justification, arguing that securing the border is imperative to manage the influx.

This policy represents a significant reversal for Biden and the Democratic Party, traditionally advocates for immigrant rights. Critics contend that Biden is adopting Trump's restrictive tactics, even utilizing the same legal clause Trump used for his contentious Muslim travel ban. Heidi Altman of the National Immigrant Justice Center cautions that this shift threatens U.S. values and commitments.

Despite past Democratic criticisms of Trump's border policies, the political landscape has shifted with rising migrant numbers straining resources in border communities and beyond. Biden, perceiving public support for stricter immigration controls, has aligned with this sentiment, aiming to alleviate pressure on cities grappling with the migrant influx.

The new measures, however, are controversial. They include a five-year ban on entry for migrants caught illegally entering during the asylum suspension, a policy long opposed by liberals. Biden defends his approach, differentiating it from Trump's more extreme measures such as family separations, and reaffirming his commitment to humane immigration policies.

This policy shift reflects a pragmatic adjustment in response to a complex, evolving immigration crisis, balancing humanitarian concerns with practical governance challenges.
