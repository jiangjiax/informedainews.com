The UN weather agency warns: within five years, we'll likely breach 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels—a critical threshold. This temporary spike, once deemed improbable, now looms with an 80% chance. The Paris Agreement aimed to cap warming at this level, fearing escalating extreme weather beyond it.

Current warming, even below 1.5°C, spawns devastating heatwaves, floods, and droughts. UN Secretary-General António Guterres likens our course to Russian roulette, urging decisive action in the next 18 months.

The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) predicts annual temperatures 1.1°C to 1.9°C above the 1850-1900 baseline. A 50-50 chance exists that the average over the next five years will exceed 1.5°C. A new annual temperature record is likely, surpassing 2023's peak.

The WMO's alarm underscores our urgent need to curb greenhouse gas emissions, lest we face escalating economic, environmental, and human costs.
