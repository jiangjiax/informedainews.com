Prolific Machines, established in 2020 by Deniz Kent, Max Huisman, and Declan Jones, has engineered a groundbreaking bioreactor that utilizes light to cultivate cells for the production of food and pharmaceuticals. Conventional techniques often depend on costly recombinant proteins and are challenging to regulate, frequently resulting in variable outcomes. Prolific Machines' innovative method leverages light, a cost-effective and easily controlled resource, to meticulously manage cell growth.

This bioreactor incorporates genetic tools, cell lines, hardware for light application, and software equipped with an algorithm to optimize light patterns. This technology is set to enhance the efficiency of producing valuable bioproducts such as nutritional proteins, antibodies, and lab-grown meat.

With $55 million secured in Series B funding, led by The Ki Tua Fund and backed by additional investors, Prolific Machines is positioned to commercialize its technology. The company is focused on transitioning from a proof-of-concept stage to market implementation, actively engaging with commercial partners.
