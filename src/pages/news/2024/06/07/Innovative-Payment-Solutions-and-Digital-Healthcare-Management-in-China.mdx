In the evolving landscape of China's healthcare, there is a growing push towards a more integrated and digital approach to managing health services. The article discusses challenges in the commercial health insurance sector, particularly its limited product diversity and insufficient support for chronically ill patients. To tackle these issues, companies like Ruiyi Yaoda are leading a movement towards a more cohesive "medicine-insurance" model. This approach leverages digital tools to enhance the accessibility and management of healthcare services, aiming to improve patient outcomes and streamline the process from screening to treatment to management. The ultimate goal is to create a collaborative ecosystem where all stakeholders—patients, insurers, and healthcare providers—benefit from this innovative approach to payment and service delivery.
