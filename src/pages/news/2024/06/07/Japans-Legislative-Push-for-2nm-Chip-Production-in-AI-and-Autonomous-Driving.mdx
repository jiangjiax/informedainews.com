Japan aims to strengthen its tech industry by legislating financial support for the production of 2nm chips, which are essential for AI and autonomous driving technologies. The government's "Robust Policy" draft focuses on legalizing and funding the mass production of next-generation semiconductors, a critical step towards achieving self-sufficiency in these advanced technologies.

The plan involves legal measures to ensure consistent financial backing and includes initiatives such as autonomous vehicle operation schedules and partnerships between universities and businesses. Recent actions include significant funding for Sumco, a major wafer manufacturer, and increased support for Rapidus to achieve 2nm chip production. Japan has also allocated funds to support semiconductor research by Taiwan's TSMC.

This strategy highlights Japan's commitment to leading in advanced technology sectors, ensuring its relevance in the global tech race. By focusing on 2nm chips—the forefront of semiconductor technology—Japan positions itself as a leader in innovation, crucial for future advancements in AI and autonomous vehicle capabilities.
