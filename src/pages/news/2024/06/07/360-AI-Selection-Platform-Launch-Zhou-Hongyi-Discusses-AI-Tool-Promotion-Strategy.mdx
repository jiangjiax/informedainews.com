At the 360 AI launch, CEO Zhou Hongyi introduced 360 AI甄选, a platform dedicated to promoting AI tools. He openly discussed his live streaming venture as a strategic marketing approach for AI products.

360 AI甄选 operates by collecting recommendations from both developers and users, which are then evaluated by experts. Tools that receive approval gain increased visibility through influencer networks. Additionally, 360 offers a membership service, granting access to over 100 office tools for an annual fee of 216元.

Zhou acknowledged the challenge of integrating AI into daily life, emphasizing the versatility of AI models but their current lack of compelling applications. He praised the AI tool Kimi for its focused marketing strategy, suggesting it as a model for others to follow.

360's goal is not only to develop AI tools but also to cultivate a marketplace and community, bridging the gap between AI technology and user needs.
