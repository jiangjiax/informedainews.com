Maotai Launches New Ice Cream Flavor for 2024: "Glutinous Rice Cake Ice Cream"

Maotai introduces its new product for 2024, the "Glutinous Rice Cake Ice Cream," priced at 49.9 RMB per box, featuring five flavors. The collaboration is with Zhongjie 1946, with each box containing 35-gram sticks, totaling five pieces.

**Market Reaction and Product Features**

The new product contains 1% Maotai liquor, sparking discussions about the market prospects of Maotai ice cream. As a renowned Chinese liquor brand, Maotai's cross-over attempt combines traditional wine culture with modern desserts, aiming to appeal to a broader consumer base.

**Financial Performance and Strategic Moves**

Maotai has recently shown strong financial performance, with record-breaking quarterly revenues and sustained growth in net profits. The company continues to explore new products, such as a collaboration with Luckin Coffee for a new spring festival offering, demonstrating its diversification strategy.

**Personal Insights**

This move by Maotai is not just an expansion of its product line but also an attempt at brand rejuvenation. By introducing ice cream, a more approachable product, Maotai seeks to break away from the traditional image of baijiu and establish an emotional connection with younger consumers. However, whether this cross-over can consistently attract consumers remains to be further validated by the market.
