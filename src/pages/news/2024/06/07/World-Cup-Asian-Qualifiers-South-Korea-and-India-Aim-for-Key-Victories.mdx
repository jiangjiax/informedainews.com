South Korea, under the leadership of Son Heung-min, is aiming for a crucial victory against Singapore to secure their place in the final round of the World Cup Asian qualifying. Despite recent coaching changes and the failure to qualify for the Olympics, the team is on course for their 11th consecutive appearance at the World Cup. With a packed stadium in Singapore, South Korea intends to showcase their strategic direction on the field.

India, currently behind Qatar in Group A, has a chance to advance to the final continental qualifying stage for the first time when they face Kuwait. This match also marks the retirement of Sunil Chhetri, India's prolific goal scorer, who ranks only behind Ronaldo and Messi in active international goals.

Saudi Arabia, needing only a draw in Pakistan, faces a tough environment despite Pakistan's elimination. Indonesia, close to making history with qualification, leads Group F and is looking for a decisive win against Iraq.

The intensity of the World Cup Asian qualifying is escalating as teams compete for spots in the expanded 2026 World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, offering eight automatic berths to Asian teams.
