DJI Automotive, a spin-off from the drone giant DJI, is revolutionizing the affordability of driver assistance technology in cars. Leveraging drone technology, they offer Level 2 autonomy at a cost of just 5,000 yuan per vehicle, making it viable even in cars priced around 100,000 yuan. This starkly contrasts with competitors like Huawei, whose systems are typically found in more expensive models.

At least 20 new models this year will feature DJI's technology, which utilizes cameras and inexpensive semiconductors instead of costly lidar and radar systems. Drawing from DJI's Phantom 4 drone technology, this approach enables vehicles to self-navigate and park autonomously, primarily on highways and familiar roads.

The appeal of DJI Automotive's technology lies in its affordability, potentially accelerating the adoption of driver assistance systems in China, a market expected to quadruple by 2025. As China aims for widespread adoption of such technologies by 2030, DJI's strategy could significantly influence the automotive landscape, making advanced driving features accessible to a broader consumer base.

Level 2 autonomy refers to vehicles that can control both steering and acceleration/deceleration under certain conditions, requiring the driver to remain engaged and ready to take control. Lidar, or Light Detection and Ranging, is a sensing method used to examine the surrounding environment by measuring the distance to a target using laser light.
