Apple's WWDC 2024 commences on June 10, focusing on software updates and developer tools. The keynote, scheduled for 10 a.m. ET, will unveil iOS 18, iPadOS, macOS 15, and more, with live streaming available on Apple's website and YouTube, though potential lag may occur on the latter platform.

Critics have consistently noted Apple's delay in adopting generative AI, a technology capable of creating content from existing data. CEO Tim Cook, hinting at transformation, may announce a speculated collaboration with OpenAI, famous for its GPT models that produce text akin to human writing.

Anticipation for AI improvements in iOS 18 is substantial, with potential integration into macOS 15. Hardware updates, typically unpredictable at this software-focused event, are unlikely this year, despite precedents such as Apple Silicon and the Vision Pro.

The event will also showcase significant design alterations to the iPhone's Calculator app, a small yet significant update. TechCrunch plans to provide live coverage from Apple Park, ensuring timely updates.
