Summary:
"Joy of Life Season 2" has become a commercial powerhouse, surpassing "Blossoms" in advertising revenue and ranking second on Tencent Video's New Year list. Tencent Video, New Classics Media, and China Literature Group's film and television division shared in the success, with 32 advertisers and 286 ads. Overseas distribution revenue is conservatively estimated to exceed $2.5 million, with the IP universe continually expanding. Membership recruitment has been significant, leading to the introduction of a new premium subscription plan, SVIP. New Classics Media and China Literature Group have reaped substantial profits, with actor Zhang Ruoyun earning a salary of 28 million yuan, boosting his commercial value. The original author, Maoni, also received substantial royalties and copyright fees.

The success of "Joy of Life Season 2" lies not only in its compelling content but also in its innovative and well-executed business model. By incorporating a high density of advertisements and implementing membership subscription strategies, the series achieved a dual increase in economic benefits and audience base. Additionally, the expansion into overseas markets and the development of IP-related merchandise further broadened its commercial scope. This comprehensive business operation not only brought substantial profits to the production parties but also provided a new profit model reference for the entire entertainment industry.
