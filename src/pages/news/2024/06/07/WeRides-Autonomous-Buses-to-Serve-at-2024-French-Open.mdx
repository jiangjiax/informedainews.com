In 2024, the French Open will witness a technological leap. Renault and the French Tennis Federation have partnered with WeRide, a leading autonomous driving company, to deploy L4-level self-driving minibuses for passenger transport during the event. These buses, pioneers in large-scale commercial operation, have already been tested and operated in 30 cities worldwide.

WeRide's advancements extend beyond the tennis courts. They have secured regulatory approvals for testing in various cities, including Guangzhou and Beijing, and have launched services in multiple forms, from street cleaning robots to passenger-carrying vehicles. The company's trajectory is marked by significant milestones: obtaining international licenses, achieving over 10 million kilometers in autonomous driving, and gearing up for an IPO in the U.S., with a valuation exceeding $5 billion.

This integration of autonomous technology into major sporting events not only showcases its readiness for public use but also underscores the rapid evolution of AI in everyday life. As these vehicles navigate the bustling streets of Paris, they symbolize a future where machines seamlessly blend with human environments, enhancing convenience and safety.
