No Normal introduces a novel coffee solution tailored for adventurers: a tube of soluble coffee paste. This Swiss innovation is designed to streamline coffee consumption in outdoor settings where traditional brewing methods prove impractical. The paste, similar to a culinary spread, can be mixed with water, applied to food, or enjoyed straight from the tube.

Each 100-gram aluminum tube holds enough paste for 15 to 25 cups, depending on the preferred strength. Notably, No Normal includes a hint of sugar to enrich the direct consumption experience, setting it apart from standard instant coffee.

Initially introduced at outdoor sports events, the product has attracted attention for its versatility and convenience. Priced at $18 per tube, it provides a cost-effective alternative to traditional coffee packs, particularly due to its portability and ease of use.

This innovation not only addresses the practical needs of outdoor enthusiasts but also redefines conventional coffee consumption practices, merging functionality with a hint of luxury.
