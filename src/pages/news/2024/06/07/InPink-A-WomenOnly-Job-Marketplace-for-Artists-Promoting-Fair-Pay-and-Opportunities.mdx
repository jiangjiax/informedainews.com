Shira Yevin, punk singer and founder of InPink, has established a women-only job marketplace catering to artists and other professionals within the music and live entertainment sector. InPink was conceived to tackle the unique challenges faced by women and non-binary creatives in traditionally male-dominated industries, addressing issues such as opportunity discovery, administrative management, and equitable compensation.

Following Yevin's initial venture, Gritty in Pink, InPink was launched to connect its users with prominent brands and has successfully arranged numerous high-profile engagements. The platform has managed transactions totaling $300,000 and currently serves over 3,000 users.

InPink is in the process of developing AI-powered tools, including a fair pay scale and a matching tool, designed to streamline and equalize the hiring process. These innovations are slated for release by early 2025.

Additionally, InPink is expanding its reach into related entertainment fields, such as sports, evidenced by its current partnership with Angel City Football Club. The platform has secured over $500,000 in funding and is on the verge of closing a $1 million pre-seed round, positioning itself as a pioneering influence in the evolving landscape of work within the entertainment industry.

DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) encompasses practices and policies aimed at fostering the representation and involvement of diverse groups, including women and non-binary individuals, within a workplace or industry.
