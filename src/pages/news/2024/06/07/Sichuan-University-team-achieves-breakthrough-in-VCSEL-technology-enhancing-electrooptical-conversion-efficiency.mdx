**Summary:**
Professor Wang Jun and his team at Sichuan University have achieved a significant breakthrough in the field of Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs), successfully developing a 15-junction VCSEL with an electro-optical conversion efficiency of 74%, breaking a two-decade stagnation in efficiency within the field. This achievement not only enhances the efficiency of semiconductor lasers but also heralds innovations in areas such as autonomous driving, optical communications, and AI computing data centers. VCSELs, known for their low cost, high reliability, and narrow spectral linewidth, are widely used in consumer electronics and intelligent sensing systems.

**Insights:**
The innovation of Wang Jun's team lies in the adoption of a multi-junction cascade structure, which significantly boosts the power and efficiency of VCSELs. This structure not only enhances the performance of the laser but also reduces costs, posing a challenge to existing lidar technologies. Moreover, the successful development of this technology foresees extensive applications in high-data-demand areas such as AI and autonomous driving, particularly in addressing energy consumption issues.

**Explanation of Terms:**
- **Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (VCSEL)**: A type of laser where the emission direction is perpendicular to the surface of the chip, offering better beam quality and lower production costs compared to traditional edge-emitting lasers.
- **Electro-Optical Conversion Efficiency**: A measure of how efficiently a laser converts electrical energy into light energy, with higher efficiency indicating less energy waste and superior performance.
- **Multi-Junction Cascade Structure**: A design that involves stacking multiple laser emission layers on a single chip to increase the output power and efficiency of the laser.
