Tokyo DisneySea has unveiled its new Fantasy Springs area, attracting a surge of foreign visitors. Anticipating a record 14% of guests from abroad, the park offers attractions themed around "Frozen," "Tangled," and "Peter Pan." The adjacent Fantasy Springs Hotel, featuring luxury rooms from $1,920 per night, is fully booked for months.

Chiba Governor Toshihito Kumagai expects tourism growth, while Tokyo Disney operator Oriental Land celebrates its highest revenue, with foreign visitors making up 12.7% of all park-goers. The Japan National Tourism Organization reports a 72.1% increase in visitors to Japan, benefiting from the weak yen.

The $2.05 billion expansion is part of a broader trend where entertainment companies capitalize on their intellectual property through theme parks. Competitors like Sony and Toei Animation are also expanding their theme park offerings, reflecting a global shift towards immersive entertainment experiences.

Urayasu City, home to Tokyo Disney Resort, is considering an accommodation tax to manage the influx of visitors and enhance local infrastructure. This tax would apply to hotels and other lodging facilities, which frequently host more guests than the city's resident population.
