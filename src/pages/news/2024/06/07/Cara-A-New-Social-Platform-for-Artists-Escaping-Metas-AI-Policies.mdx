Artists, frustrated by Meta's AI training on their work, have turned to Cara, a platform that respects copyright. In a week, Cara grew from 40,000 to 650,000 users.

Meta, owner of Instagram, uses public posts to train its AI, with only European users able to opt out due to GDPRâ€”a regulation that protects personal data. This practice led artists to seek alternatives.

Jingna Zhang, a photographer and Cara's founder, experienced this firsthand, winning a copyright case against an artist who used her work without consent. Cara, blending Instagram and microblogging, allows artists to share without fear of AI exploitation.

Zhang is also fighting tech giants like Google and Stability AI for unauthorized use of artists' work in their AI systems. Cara partners with the University of Chicago's Glaze project to prevent AI scraping of artists' work.

Despite financial hurdles, including a recent $96,280 hosting bill, Zhang's commitment to a rights-respecting community remains strong. In an AI-dominated world, Cara offers artists a safe space to share their creations without exploitation.
