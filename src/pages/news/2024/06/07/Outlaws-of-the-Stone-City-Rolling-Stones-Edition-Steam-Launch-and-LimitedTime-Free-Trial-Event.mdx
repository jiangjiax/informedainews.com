"Outlaw Tycoon: Rolling Stone City" Debuts on Steam

505 Games and INGAME STUDIOS have teamed up to launch "Outlaw Tycoon: Rolling Stone City" on Steam at an introductory price of 76 RMB. On June 18, players worldwide can enjoy this game, including all DLCs available for free for a limited time.

**DLC Explanation:**
DLC, short for "Downloadable Content," refers to additional content provided post-release for games, typically including new missions, characters, weapons, etc., to enhance the gaming experience.

**Limited-Time Free Trial**
Starting from June 6, players can participate in the VIP Steam game test and experience the game for free. Registration information can be obtained from the game's Steam page or 505 Games' social media accounts.

**Developer's Commitment**
Jarek Kolář of INGAME STUDIOS stated that the improvements made over the past year will allow players to feel the positive changes in the game. In the future, from the Halloween-themed content in 2024 to the "Winter Operations" planned for early 2025, more new content is in the pipeline.

**Personal Insight**
This move not only attracts new players but also rewards loyal fans. The limited-time free trial and free provision of DLCs are clever market strategies aimed at expanding the player base, while also demonstrating the developers' sincerity and confidence in the game's quality.
