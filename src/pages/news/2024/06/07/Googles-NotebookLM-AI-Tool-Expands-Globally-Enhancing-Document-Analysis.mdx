Google's NotebookLM, an AI note-taking assistant, now serves over 200 countries, including India and the UK. Initially based in the U.S. and previously known as Project Tailwind, it utilizes Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro AI to summarize documents and answer queries based on user-uploaded content. Unlike typical AI chatbots, NotebookLM strictly adheres to source materials, ensuring accuracy and relevance.

With support for 108 languages, it extracts information from various formats such as Google Slides, web URLs, PDFs, and text files. Features like inline citations enable users to verify AI responses against original sources. NotebookLM assists in creating documents like FAQs and study guides, and has been employed for tasks such as summarizing interview transcripts and drafting grant proposals.

Google ensures privacy, stating that user data is not used to train its algorithms, thereby protecting the confidentiality of documents. This free service positions NotebookLM as a formidable competitor in the AI-driven document summarization market, traditionally dominated by paid startup tools.
