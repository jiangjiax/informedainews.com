Nvidia, a leading manufacturer of AI chips, has eclipsed Apple in market value, soaring to $3.012 trillion. This milestone positions Nvidia as the second most valuable company worldwide, trailing only Microsoft, valued at $3.15 trillion.

The surge in Nvidia's market value is largely attributed to a dramatic increase in demand for its AI processors. This demand is being driven by tech behemoths such as Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet, which are rapidly enhancing their AI capabilities. Nvidia's stock has experienced an astonishing 147% growth in 2024 alone, a clear indication of robust investor confidence in the future of AI.

Conversely, Apple is grappling with issues including declining iPhone sales and fierce competition in the Chinese market. Some investors view Apple as lagging in its integration of AI into its products compared to its industry counterparts.

Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, has emerged as a significant figure in the tech sector, renowned for steering the company's AI-centric expansion. Despite its rapid ascent, Nvidia maintains a relatively modest price-to-earnings ratio, currently trading at 39 times expected earnings, a decrease from over 70 a year prior.

This change in market leadership highlights the escalating significance of AI in both technology and business strategies, foreshadowing a future where AI capabilities may be pivotal in determining corporate success.
