Disney and DeSantis' appointees, following a legal dispute, have reached an agreement. Disney intends to invest $17 billion in Florida parks, potentially adding a fifth theme park and expanding accommodations and retail spaces. In exchange, Disney must support local infrastructure and housing, and prioritize Florida-based contractors.

The conflict arose when DeSantis, unhappy with Disney's opposition to Florida's "Don't Say Gay" law, assumed control of the district overseeing Disney World. Disney filed a lawsuit, claiming a violation of its free speech rights. The settlement halts this legal confrontation, enabling both parties to concentrate on development.

This agreement marks a strategic shift, balancing Disney's expansion goals with local community needs, potentially setting a precedent for corporate-government relations in development projects.
