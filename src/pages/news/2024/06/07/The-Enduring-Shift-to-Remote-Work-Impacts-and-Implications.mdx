Remote work, once a rarity, surged during the pandemic and has since stabilized at a significant levelâ€”about 25% of workdays. This shift is not temporary; it's a lasting change in the labor market.

Why? Remote work is profitable for companies, reducing turnover and office costs. Employees value it highly, equating it to an 8% pay raise. Hybrid work, a blend of remote and in-office, is particularly popular.

Despite some return-to-office mandates, these are exceptions. The traditional five-day office week is fading, especially for roles that can be done remotely. Companies now recruit nationwide, potentially lowering wages in high cost-of-living areas.

Critics argue remote work hampers oversight and mentoring, but studies show it doesn't harm productivity. In fact, it benefits society by reducing commuting pollution and allowing more family time.

Remote work is a triple win: good for employees, companies, and society. It's hard to find a more beneficial change in modern work practices.
