NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang has hinted at a potential expansion in Taiwan, suggesting the establishment of an AI supercomputer center in Kaohsiung and a research facility near Taipei. This announcement was made during a dinner hosted by Quanta Chairman Barry Lam at a private kitchen in Taipei. Huang, known for his charismatic presence, playfully interacted with a balloon likeness of himself, positioning it at the entrance as if to "interview" with the press.
