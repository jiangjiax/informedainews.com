Wix, renowned for web design, now creates mobile apps using AI. Simply verbalize your app concept in plain language; their AI chatbot transforms it into an app, compatible with iOS or Android. This extends their AI website builder, introduced the previous year.

Critics question the reliability, pointing to varied reviews of their AI site builder. Avishai Abrahami, CEO, responds with accolades and statistics: hundreds of thousands of AI-generated sites. He acknowledges AI mistakes but assures ongoing improvements and robust security.

Priced at $99 per month, this tool could disrupt app development, competing with companies and freelancers utilizing AI. Abrahami emphasizes: Wix aims to enhance, not replace, developers, especially in intricate projects.

Generative AI refers to AI that produces content—text, images, code—based on user input.
A chatbot-like interface is an interactive UI that simulates human conversation, assisting users in navigating AI tools.
