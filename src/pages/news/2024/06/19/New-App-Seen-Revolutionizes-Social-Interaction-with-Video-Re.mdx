Seen, a new app co-founded by Faheem Kajee and actress Karen Gillan, aims to enhance social interactions by allowing users to record video reactions to shared content. Available on iOS, the app facilitates private and group video exchanges, fostering more authentic engagement than traditional text responses.

Key features include TikTok integration and plans for future integrations with YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels. Seen has attracted significant investment and celebrity involvement, leveraging Gillan's influence for user acquisition.

The app's potential extends beyond personal use, envisioning applications for content creators, comedians, and even investors. Future developments include a public feed and monetization strategies, such as premium content and targeted advertising based on user reactions.

Seen taps into a growing desire for genuine online connections, particularly relevant amidst a perceived loneliness epidemic. Its success will hinge on its ability to deliver on the promise of deeper, more meaningful interactions in a digital age.
