Memes, once mere internet fodder, now shape presidential politics. Biden and Trump, through their campaigns, harness these digital snippets to sway public opinion. Biden's team seeks a "meme manager," recognizing the medium's power to connect with millions reliant on social media for information. Trump, a meme aficionado, and his allies also leverage this tool, often with brash, self-aggrandizing content.

Both candidates use memes to craft narratives, Biden with a strategic partnership approach, and Trump through direct, often mocking, engagement. Memes, though risky with potential for backlash, offer a swift, impactful way to convey political messages in an era where traditional media struggles to reach audiences.
