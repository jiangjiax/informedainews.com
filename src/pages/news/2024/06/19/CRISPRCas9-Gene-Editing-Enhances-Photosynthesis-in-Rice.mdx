Researchers at UC Berkeley's Innovative Genome Institute have advanced gene expression in rice using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, diverging from conventional gene reduction techniques. This represents the first unbiased method to elevate gene expression and subsequent photosynthetic activity.

The study, affiliated with the RIPE project, sought to enhance global food production by boosting photosynthetic efficiency in crops. Unlike synthetic biology, which introduces foreign genes, this research concentrated on amplifying native plant genes.

Employing CRISPR/Cas9, the team modified upstream DNA that regulates gene expression in rice, a staple crop with single copies of crucial photosynthetic genes. The outcomes were significant, demonstrating substantial increases in gene expression, indicating the resilience of plant DNA to significant alterations.

This approach, despite its challenges, provides a swift, targeted means to improve specific crop traits, possibly circumventing regulatory obstacles linked to traditional genetic modification. The implications are far-reaching, suggesting a future where gene editing could rapidly tackle agricultural challenges, especially in adapting to climate change.
