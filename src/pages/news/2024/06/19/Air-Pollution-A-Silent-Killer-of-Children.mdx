Air pollution claims nearly 2,000 young lives daily, surpassing poor sanitation and unclean water as a global health threat. It ranks second only to malnutrition in child mortality, disproportionately affecting poorer nations. PM2.5 particles, which are tiny enough to infiltrate bloodstreams, are the primary culprits, linked to a range of diseases from lung ailments to dementia.

The climate crisis exacerbates this issue, with droughts and wildfires increasing airborne particles. Indoor pollution, often stemming from cooking fuels, is equally lethal. Transitioning to cleaner energy sources could mitigate both the health and climate crises.

The urgency is clear: immediate, targeted action is imperative to safeguard future generations.
