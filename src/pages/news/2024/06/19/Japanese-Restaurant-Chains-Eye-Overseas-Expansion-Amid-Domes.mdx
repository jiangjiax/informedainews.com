Nearly half of Japan's restaurant chains with an international presence are planning to expand, driven by the worldwide demand for Japanese cuisine. A Nikkei survey indicates that 44.3% of these operators are looking to open additional stores overseas, marking a notable increase compared to previous years. Prominent companies such as Zensho, Kura Sushi, and Toridoll Holdings are actively growing their presence in markets including the U.S., Southeast Asia, and the U.K.

In contrast, domestic challenges continue to loom, with rising construction costs and a critical labor shortage impacting 30.7% of the surveyed companies. This situation has resulted in fewer new domestic store openings and a rise in restaurant bankruptcies, hitting an all-time high in fiscal 2023.

Despite these obstacles, the global interest in Japanese food remains strong, encouraging strategic overseas expansion and adaptations such as local partnerships and improved compensation packages to attract labor.
