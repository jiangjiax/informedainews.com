Wang Changtian of Enlight Media has pledged that the film adaptation of "The Three体" will have an unlimited budget, aimed at respecting the original work and the creative vision of director Zhang Yimou. The project is still in the script stage, with a global casting call, and faces significant adaptation challenges. The team is prepared for potential controversies. Zhang Yimou, who initially declined to direct, has now confirmed his involvement. Wang Changtian emphasizes that the investment will be unlimited, striving for the best possible outcome.

Insight:
The commitment to unlimited investment underscores the value placed on the cultural significance of "The Three体" and the trust in Zhang Yimou's directorial prowess. This move could propel Chinese science fiction films to new heights, but it also necessitates caution against the risks of overinvestment.
