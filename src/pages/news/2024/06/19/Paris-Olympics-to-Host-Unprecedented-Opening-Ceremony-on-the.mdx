The Paris Olympics is gearing up for a groundbreaking opening ceremony on the River Seine, featuring a fusion of diverse dance styles directed by Thomas Jolly. Set against Paris's iconic backdrop, the event promises a spectacular display of urban, contemporary, classic, and break dancing.

Security is a top priority, with 45,000 personnel deployed and airspace restrictions in place. The ceremony, free for many, will feature Olympians parading on boats along the Seine, aiming to showcase French heritage and creativity to a global audience.

This bold departure from a traditional stadium setting marks a historic first, promising a memorable blend of dream and reality.
