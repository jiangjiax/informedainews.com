Taylor Swift's Eras tour, set to be the most lucrative in music history, arrives in Cardiff for a single show. Over 70,000 fans are expected, with warnings of potential M4 motorway chaos similar to Ed Sheeran's previous Cardiff concerts. Traffic Wales predicts a 15% increase in congestion.

Swift fans are advised to travel early and use public transport. Rail services are enhanced with extra trains after the concert, providing over 15,000 additional seats. City center roads will be closed, and police presence will be increased for safety.

For fans like 14-year-old Cassie Evans, a cancer survivor, the concert is more than just music; it's a symbol of hope, aiming for the iconic '22 hat' that Swift traditionally gives.

Cardiff is preparing for an overwhelming wave of Swift enthusiasm, urging preparation and patience amidst the anticipated excitement.
