Starlink Mini, a compact satellite dish, nears release. SpaceX's update reveals images, showcasing a portable design, roughly the size of a MacBook Pro. This smaller version, certified by the FCC, includes a built-in router supporting 2.4 and 5GHz bands, and an Ethernet port. Elon Musk confirms its ease of setup and portability, suggesting it fits in a backpack.

Musk tweets performance stats: 100Mbps download, 11.5Mbps upload, and 23ms latency. Slower than its larger counterpart, yet sufficient for multiple 4K streams and possibly gaming. Priced at about half of the standard dish, it targets those seeking affordability without compromising on essential internet needs.

Ideal for travel and remote areas, the Starlink Mini extends internet access where traditional services falter. A practical solution for connectivity on the move, it democratizes access in underserved regions.
