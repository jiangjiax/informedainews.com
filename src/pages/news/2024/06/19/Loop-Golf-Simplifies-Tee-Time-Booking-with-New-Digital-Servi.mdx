The surge in golf's popularity during the pandemic has led to a scarcity of tee times. Loop Golf, a digital matchmaker, streamlines this process by booking tee times based on user preferences, with a 10% service fee. Founder Matt Holder, exasperated by the traditional booking methods, utilized his experience in marketplace startups to develop a concierge-style service. Loop Golf's software efficiently locates and secures tee times, saving golfers countless hours of searching.

The startup, which has partnered with over 3,000 courses, recently raised $1 million in seed funding. Holder strategically limited the fundraising to retain control and high profit margins, supported by AI tools that minimize staffing requirements. Loop Golf intends to collaborate with courses by filling last-minute cancellations and aims to become an invaluable data resource for them.

Although competitors like Noteefy exist, Loop Golf's distinctive approach and rapid growth—with monthly gross merchandise value doubling—place it in a strong position. With projections of millions in tee time bookings within a year, Loop Golf is well-positioned for substantial expansion.
