Sprint legend Michael Johnson has unveiled Grand Slam Track, a league designed to assemble 100 of the world's top athletes four times a year, offering a total of $12.6 million in prizes. Set to launch in April, the events will take place in Los Angeles, another U.S. city, and two international locations. World-record hurdler Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone has joined, significantly enhancing the league's profile.

Johnson, discontent with the current scarcity of high-stakes track competitions, aims to address this issue by providing substantial financial incentives. The league, which includes "GST Racers" and "GST Challengers," will award $100,000 to the winners, with prize money extending to eighth place.

Television coverage is essential, and negotiations with major broadcasters are in progress. Johnson sees Grand Slam Track not as a disruptive force but as a necessary enhancement to a sport that is undervalued.

Recent initiatives by World Athletics, such as Olympic gold medalist bonuses and the Ultimate Championship, indicate a move towards greater recognition and reward in track and field. Johnson intends to leverage this momentum, consistently bringing track and field to the forefront.
