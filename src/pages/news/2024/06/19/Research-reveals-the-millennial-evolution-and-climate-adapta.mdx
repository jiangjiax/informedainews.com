Researchers have traced the lineage of the world's most popular coffee, Arabica, through a millennium of climatic shifts, revealing insights crucial for breeding climate-resilient varieties. The study, led by the University at Buffalo, produced the highest quality reference genome for Arabica coffee, detailing its evolution over 600,000 years.

This new genome highlights Arabica's low genetic diversity, making it vulnerable to pests and climate change. The research underscores the need for developing new strains that can withstand environmental pressures. Arabica originated from a natural cross between two other coffee species in Ethiopia over 600,000 years ago, long before human cultivation.

The study also notes significant population fluctuations in Arabica populations, correlating with historical climate changes in East Africa. Understanding these dynamics is vital for future breeding efforts. The reference genome, now publicly available, offers a roadmap for enhancing Arabica's resilience, potentially safeguarding this beloved bean from future threats.
