Russia and China sent bombers near Alaska for a joint patrol, marking the first time in that region. Two Russian Tu-95s and two Chinese Xian H-6s flew over the Chukchi and Bering seas, escorted by Russian fighter jets. The flight lasted over five hours.

Russia stated that the drill was not against any third country, but it prompted the U.S. and Canada to dispatch their own jets for interception. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin noted that the bombers remained about 200 miles off the coast.

This move underscores the deepening military ties between Russia and China, partly serving as a message to the West, particularly following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Both countries have ramped up joint military exercises since 2019.

Alexander Gabuev from the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center views this as a signal to the U.S. that Russia is not alone, having a powerful partner with a significant nuclear arsenal.

The bombers did not enter U.S. or Canadian airspace. They operated within the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), a perimeter just outside U.S. airspace where aircraft must be identified for security purposes. NORAD, the joint U.S.-Canada defense operation, did not perceive the bombers as a threat.
