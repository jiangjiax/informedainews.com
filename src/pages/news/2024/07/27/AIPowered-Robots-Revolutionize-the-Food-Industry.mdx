In 2035, robots like the NS-5 from "I, Robot" will slice vegetables faster than seasoned chefs. However, in 2024, most people haven't tasted meals cooked by robots. Some robots, though, operate invisibly in industrial kitchens, preparing mass-produced foods for supermarkets and airlines.

Chef Robotics, a startup, employs AI-driven arms to handle a variety of foods, from Indian curry to Italian pasta. These robots never tire, reduce waste, and handle portions precisely, unlike human cooks. They adapt to various containers and speeds, using different tools for different sizes.

Chef Robotics doesn't sell robots but offers services under a Robot as a Service (RaaS) model. They have produced 20 million meals in two years, deployed in six cities. Humans still input orders and assist, but the vision is clear: robots handle the bulk, humans oversee.

Sweetgreen uses salad-making robots, speeding up service but still requiring human oversight and cleanup. Chipotle tests robots for tasks like making chips and slicing avocados, though challenges like maintenance persist.

Stanford's ALOHA robot can cook complex dishes but needs human guidance. Meanwhile, AI-powered "美膳狮" from 橡鹿科技 aims to standardize Chinese cuisine, promising chef-like results with less human intervention.

The takeaway? Robots enhance efficiency but don't fully replace humans. They standardize processes, ensuring consistency and freeing humans for more complex tasks. The future of dining might be automated, but human touch remains crucial.
