Celine Dion made a triumphant return to the stage at the Paris Olympics opening ceremony, marking her first live performance in four years. She delivered a powerful solo rendition of Edith Piaf's L'Hymne Ã  l'Amour atop the Eiffel Tower. Dion has been battling Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS), a rare neurological disorder that affects muscle control and voice. Despite the challenges, her performance showed significant progress in her vocal therapy.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau commended her resilience, labeling her a "Canadian icon." Italian singer Laura Pausini expressed heartfelt support, revealing that her hands trembled and eyes welled up during Dion's performance. Dion's appearance was highly anticipated, drawing large crowds in Paris.

This was not Dion's first Olympic appearance; she also performed at the Atlanta 1996 opening ceremony. Her comeback follows a surprise appearance at the Grammy Awards earlier this year and hints at a new Las Vegas residency. Dion holds the record for the most successful residency in Las Vegas history. Her recent documentary, I Am: Celine Dion, has become Amazon Prime Video's most successful documentary.
