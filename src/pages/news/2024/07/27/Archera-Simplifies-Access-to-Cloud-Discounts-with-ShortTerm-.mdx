Cloud costs are a concern for many companies. A survey indicates that most believe they are too high. Major cloud providers such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure offer discounts, but require long-term commitments.

Aran Khanna, a former AWS employee, identified a gap in the market and co-founded Archera in 2019. Archera enables companies to access these discounts with shorter, 30-day commitments, for which they charge a fee.

In addition to this service, Archera provides consulting and tools to assist companies in managing and optimizing their cloud expenditures. They assert that their methods comply with all cloud provider regulations.

The startup boasts 400 customers and generates $7 million annually, having been profitable since mid-2023. Recently, they secured $17 million in Series B funding, which they intend to use to expand their services to Azure and Google Cloud, as well as to grow their team.

Aran believes that Archera's distinctive approach gives them a competitive advantage in the cloud cost management sector. Despite slowdowns in the tech industry, they have observed a growing interest in their services.
