BiVACOR, in partnership with Texas Heart Institute, successfully implanted their Total Artificial Heart (TAH) on July 9, 2024. This TAH, a titanium dual-chamber pump, uses magnetic levitation to mimic heart function. Aimed at severe heart failure patients unsuitable for other devices, this technology bridges the gap to transplant.

Heart failure affects millions worldwide. Transplants are rare, limited to under 6000 annually. BiVACOR's TAH offers a new lifeline, potentially aiding tens of thousands awaiting heart transplants. This innovation marks a significant stride in cardiac care.
