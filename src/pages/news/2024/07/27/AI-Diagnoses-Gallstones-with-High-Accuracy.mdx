This technology is not solely about speed; it also reduces errors and allows doctors to concentrate on treatment. It is a clear advantage for both patients and doctors.

In essence, AI is revolutionizing medicine, making it more efficient and reliable. This development is just the beginning. Expect more breakthroughs as AI continues to evolve within the healthcare sector.
