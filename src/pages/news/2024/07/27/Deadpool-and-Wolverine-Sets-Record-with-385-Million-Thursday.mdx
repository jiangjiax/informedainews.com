"Deadpool and Wolverine," starring Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, raked in $38.5 million during Thursday previews. This positions the film for a record-breaking $150 million-plus domestic opening, marking the largest debut for an R-rated film.

Thursday previews, now a staple for major releases, offer early box office insights and satisfy eager fans. "Deadpool and Wolverine" secured the 8th largest preview haul ever and tops among R-rated films.

The film is expected to gross between $160 million and $180 million domestically, setting a new 2024 record and cementing its status as the biggest R-rated opener.

Despite its R-rating, theater operators anticipate strong turnout, viewing it as a draw rather than a deterrent. The film's success could revitalize Disney and Marvel's theatrical releases, which have been sparse recently.

"Deadpool and Wolverine" is the first MCU film since November and the only one slated for 2024. Future plans, including potential changes due to recent industry disruptions, will be unveiled at upcoming conventions.
