ChatGPT, OpenAI's AI chatbot, made a significant impact in 2022. By 2024, it has become a major force, utilized by 92% of Fortune 500 companies. OpenAI has risen to prominence, particularly after forming a partnership with Apple for Apple Intelligence.

In 2024, OpenAI introduced GPT-4o, a new model with voice and vision capabilities. However, they temporarily halted one voice, named Sky, which was accused of impersonating Scarlett Johansson. OpenAI is also managing internal conflicts and facing a lawsuit related to copyright infringement.

They are developing SearchGPT, an AI-powered search tool to compete with Google. OpenAI is projected to incur a loss of $5 billion this year, with $7 billion spent on ChatGPT operations. They have released GPT-4o mini, a more affordable and faster model.

Partnerships include collaborations with Los Alamos National Laboratory for bioscience, TIME magazine, and Reddit. OpenAI created CriticGPT to identify errors in ChatGPT's code. They postponed the launch of ChatGPT's Voice Mode due to technical issues.

Apple has integrated ChatGPT into Siri and other applications. The House Oversight subcommittee invited Scarlett Johansson to discuss the controversy surrounding the Sky voice. ChatGPT experienced outages and secured a major deal with PwC.

OpenAI is preparing the successor to GPT-4 and addressing board disclosures about ChatGPT's launch. Mobile app revenue surged following the launch of GPT-4o. OpenAI suspended the Sky voice and introduced file integration from Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive.
