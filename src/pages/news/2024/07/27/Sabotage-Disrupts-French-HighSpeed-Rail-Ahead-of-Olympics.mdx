PARISâ€”On July 26, 2024, sabotage struck French high-speed rail lines just hours before the Olympics opening ceremony. Incendiary devices ignited fires, crippling TGV lines. Transport Minister Patrice Vergriete described it as a "massive attack."

The disruptions were concentrated at Montparnasse station. Videos revealed crowded hallways. Paris police increased security measures. Travel to London, Belgium, and throughout France was severely impacted. SNCF characterized the incidents as coordinated.

Government officials denounced the acts, although no direct link to the Olympics was established. Sports Minister Amelie Oudea-Castera highlighted the impact on both travelers and athletes. Eurostar cautioned about potential delays.

SNCF was uncertain when traffic would resume, anticipating disruptions to persist throughout the weekend. They urged passengers to postpone their journeys. Valerie Pecresse, from the regional council, estimated that 250,000 travelers were affected. While substitution plans were in effect, she advised against visiting the stations.

The attack occurred amidst global tensions and heightened security measures for the Olympics. Many were planning to attend the opening ceremony, exacerbating the chaos.
