Manhattan prosecutors remain resolute. They assert that Trump's conviction stands, despite his claims of immunity. The case involves hush money paid to a porn star, Stormy Daniels. Trump's team contends that the Supreme Court's immunity ruling should nullify the verdict. Prosecutors counter, highlighting Trump's actions and personal transactions prior to his presidency.

Trump was charged with 34 felonies. He falsified business records to conceal the $130,000 payment made by Cohen. Trump denies the affair and intends to appeal. He is the first former president to be convicted of a crime.

The Supreme Court has ruled that presidents are immune from criminal charges related to official acts. However, this case primarily concerns Trump's personal life before he assumed office. Judge Juan Merchan may not dismiss the verdict. He is expected to make a decision by September 6th. If the conviction is upheld, Trump faces sentencing and the possibility of further appeals.

Key points:
- Trump convicted of falsifying business records.
- Prosecutors argue the case is unaffected by the recent immunity ruling.
- Judge to decide on the conviction by early September.
- If upheld, Trump faces sentencing and potential appeal.
