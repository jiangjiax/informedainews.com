Scientists have solved a longstanding issue in material design: the absence of a mathematical foundation for three-dimensional conformal methods. A team led by Professors Qiu Chengwei from the National University of Singapore and Huang Jiping from Fudan University has developed a new technique called Conformality-Assisted Tracing (CAT).

CAT enables the precise and efficient design of complex 3D structures, surpassing previous geometric limitations. It operates by constructing a 3D grid using heat flow lines and isotherms, circumventing the problem of lacking a mathematical representation for 3D coordinates.

This method is not limited to heat; it can also handle optical and other wave systems. It is faster and more accurate than traditional methods, marking a significant advancement in the design of metamaterials used in stealth technology and other cutting-edge applications.

The team is now exploring the expansion of CAT's applications to fluid dynamics and elasticity, with the goal of addressing challenges such as chip cooling and aircraft insulation. They are also investigating the use of quaternions to extend material parameter design into spacetime dimensions.
