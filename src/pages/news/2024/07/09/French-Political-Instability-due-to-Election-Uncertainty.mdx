Macron retained Prime Minister Gabriel Attal after a chaotic election. No clear winner emerged; left, center, and right all fell short. The New Popular Front led but did not secure a majority. The far-right National Rally came in third. Despite a high voter turnout, France now faces a hung parliament, possibly leading to political gridlock.

This outcome has broader implications beyond French politics. It could affect the war in Ukraine, global diplomacy, and Europe's economy. Germany, a key partner, expressed relief that the far right did not dominate.

Attal planned to resign but will remain for now. His disagreement with Macron's decision to hold early elections highlights internal tensions. France's political uncertainty looms large, especially with the Paris Olympics approaching.

In summary, France's political landscape is fractured, with far-reaching implications. The stability of Europe and beyond hangs in the balance.
