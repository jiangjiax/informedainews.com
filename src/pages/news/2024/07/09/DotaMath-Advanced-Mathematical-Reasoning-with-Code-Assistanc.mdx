DotaMath, a new approach to complex math problems, breaks them down into simpler parts. It uses code to solve these parts, checks its work, and corrects mistakes. Trained on a large dataset of math questions and answers, DotaMath models perform well on tests, even outperforming other models. The method shows promise for tackling tough math challenges. Code is available online for anyone to use.
