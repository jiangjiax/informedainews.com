Volt Singapore, part of Keppel, plans to build Southeast Asia's largest EV charging hub. Set in western Singapore, it will host 80 fast-charging points for buses, taxis, and cars. The hub aims to be operational by mid-2026, supporting Singapore's goal to phase out combustion engine vehicles by 2040.

The project, awarded by ComfortDelGro, involves a 15-year contract. Details on the contract's value were not disclosed. Charging times will be as quick as 10 minutes, thanks to 360 kW and 120 kW charging points.

EV adoption in Singapore is growing. From January to May, EVs made up nearly one-third of new car registrations, almost doubling from 2023. Volt, a joint venture between Keppel Infrastructure and Wanbang Digital Energy, is keen on promoting sustainable transportation.

Singapore is pushing for greener commercial transport. ComfortDelGro aims to switch 90% of its cars and 50% of its buses to cleaner energy by 2030. Grab, another Singapore-based company, plans to replace its ride-hailing fleet with low-emission vehicles by the same year.

By 2030, Singapore expects to have 60,000 EV chargers, up from over 7,100 currently.
