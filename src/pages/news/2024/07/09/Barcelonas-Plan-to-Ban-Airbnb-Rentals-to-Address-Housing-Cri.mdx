Barcelona plans to ban short-term rentals by November 2028. Mayor Jaume Collboni aims to reclaim 10,000 Airbnb apartments for long-term housing, addressing the city's severe housing crisis. This move reflects a global trend scrutinizing platforms like Airbnb and VRBO, questioning the balance between tourism and local welfare.

Critics blame Airbnb for inflating housing prices, forcing locals to endure unregulated hotel-like environments. However, a Harvard Business Review study suggests that outright bans might not lower rents significantly. In New York City, the ban led to record hotel rates, averaging $300 per night.

City councils may prioritize local sentiments over tourism, using bans to signal political responsiveness. Alternatives like Berlin's 90-day rental limit for owner-occupiers exist, balancing supplementary income for part-time hosts with housing stability.

The challenge lies in effective regulation. How to implement and fund such measures remains crucial. The debate continues, not just about numbers, but about community well-being and tourism's role.
