New Chancellor Rachel Reeves aims to kickstart Britain's economy and tackle housing shortages. In her first speech, she highlighted reforms in the planning system and lifted the ban on new onshore wind farms. Reeves plans to restore mandatory housing targets and cut red tape to boost housebuilding.

Labour's goal is to build 1.5 million homes, aiming for 300,000 annually. This push follows a period of economic stagnation post-Brexit, pandemic, and global inflation. Reeves emphasized Britain as a safe investment haven and set a target for the highest sustained growth in the G7.

The party also plans to raise £7.35 billion by closing tax loopholes and create a £7.3 billion National Wealth Fund for key industries. Reeves confirmed no changes to the Bank of England's reserve treatment.

Reeves' approach signals a decisive shift towards economic recovery and growth, focusing on housing and business investment.
