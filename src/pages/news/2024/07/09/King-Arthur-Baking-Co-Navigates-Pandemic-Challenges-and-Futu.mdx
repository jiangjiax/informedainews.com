King Arthur Baking Co., America's oldest flour company, founded in 1790, faced a surge in demand during the pandemic. CEO Karen Colberg navigated the crisis by leveraging the company's strengths: a robust mail-order business and extensive online baking resources.

The pandemic boosted home baking, a trend that persists. King Arthur responds by expanding its product line, including gluten-free options and bread mix kits, aiming to diversify beyond flour.

Employee ownership since 2004 fosters a collaborative culture. Colberg highlights the benefits of shared leadership, emphasizing humility and open communication.

Looking ahead, King Arthur plans to open baking schools nationwide, starting in 2026, to capitalize on the growing interest in artisan baking.
