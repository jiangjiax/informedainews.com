CRISPR, a gene-editing tool, has found a new use: treating cobra bites. Snake bites kill nearly 140,000 people yearly and disable 400,000 more. Cobras, in particular, cause severe tissue damage and pain.

Standard treatment involves antivenom, but it's costly, needs refrigeration, and is specific to snake types. Nicholas Casewell and his team at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine used CRISPR to identify human genes that react to cobra venom, leading to heparin, a drug already in use since the 1930s.

Heparin prevents blood clotting and could be a simpler, more effective treatment. The team plans clinical trials to test its efficacy in the field. If successful, heparin could be stored in rural areas, ready for immediate use.

Greg Neely, a coauthor, sees potential in using CRISPR to understand and counteract venom effects across different snakes. This approach could lead to broader treatments, saving more lives.
