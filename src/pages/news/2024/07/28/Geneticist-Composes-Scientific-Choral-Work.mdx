Jenny Graves, an evolutionary geneticist and choral singer, has created a 110-minute choral work titled "Origins of the Universe, of Life, of Species, of Humanity." This piece retells the story of creation through scientific discoveries, blending cosmology, molecular biology, and more. Graves, known for her bold and humorous approach, faced resistance but ultimately received a standing ovation in Melbourne.

Born in Adelaide, Graves initially disliked biology until a high school genetics lesson on budgerigars sparked her interest. She pursued genetics, studying sex-determining chromosomes in kangaroos and earning a Ph.D. at Berkeley. Graves later focused on comparative genomics, comparing genomes of various species to understand evolutionary patterns.

Her career highlights include challenging a key genetic theory and predicting the eventual disappearance of the human Y chromosome. Despite health challenges and gender bias in her field, Graves remained resilient, using music to engage students and colleagues.

Graves' work exemplifies the intersection of science and art, challenging traditional narratives with empirical evidence. Her journey from a disengaged student to a pioneering scientist underscores the transformative power of curiosity and persistence.
