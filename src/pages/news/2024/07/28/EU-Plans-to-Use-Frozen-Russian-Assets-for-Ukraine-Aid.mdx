EU plans to use 1.5 billion euros from frozen Russian central bank assets to aid Ukraine's military and reconstruction. These assets, totaling about 210 billion euros, were frozen due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen views this as a fitting use of the funds. Russia threatens retaliation. Additionally, the Group of Seven aims to finalize a 50-billion-dollar loan to Ukraine using Russian assets by year's end.
