Researchers from Ritsumeikan University have developed a new method that utilizes visible light to completely decompose perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFAS) at room temperature, a harmful chemical substance commonly referred to as the "forever chemical." This method decomposes PFAS into fluoride ions within 8 hours, enabling sustainable recovery of fluorine.

PFAS, due to its stability, is widely used in products such as cookware, clothing, and firefighting foams. However, this stability makes it difficult to decompose in the environment, posing threats to health and the environment. Traditionally, PFAS requires temperatures above 400Â°C to decompose, making its treatment challenging.

The new method employs visible LED light to irradiate semiconductor nanocrystals, efficiently decomposing PFAS into fluoride ions through mechanisms involving photoinduced ligand displacement and Auger-induced electron injection. This method operates at room temperature, is easy to manage, and the defluorination efficiency increases with extended illumination time, achieving 100% defluorination within 8 hours.

This technology not only revolutionizes the treatment of PFAS but also promotes the recovery of fluorine, reducing reliance on new fluorine production, and making a significant contribution to establishing a sustainable fluorine recovery society.
