NASA's exploring fungi for lunar and Mars habitats. Funded with $2M, the Mycotecture Off Planet project aims to grow sustainable living spaces using myceliumâ€”the underground network of fungi.

This tech could transform space construction. Lightweight, compact habitats, made with dormant fungi and other materials, could be transported to other planets. Once there, adding water activates the fungi, expanding the habitat into a usable structure.

Lynn Rothschild leads this research at NASA Ames. The project's not just for space; it could also benefit Earth, aiding in water filtration and waste management.

NASA's commitment to innovative tech like this underscores their mission to push boundaries in space exploration. The potential to build on the moon, then Mars, marks a significant step in human space habitation.
