Paris Olympic Opening, 2024. Rain drenched the Seine. Athletes in boats, spectators soaked. Lady Gaga kicked off with kitsch cabaret. Aya Nakamura followed, her performance a triumph over racism.

The show, a 6km spectacle, defied stereotypes. Dancers, drag queens, acrobatics. The Eiffel Tower glowed with Olympic rings. Despite sabotage and storms, the event went on.

Thomas Jolly, the director, aimed for depth, not just glitz. The Seine, a symbol of healing from past traumas, featured prominently. Athletes from 206 nations paraded. Ukraine received loud cheers.

Traditional French dances and music mixed with modern acts. Gojira, a death metal band, performed with Marina Viotti. Acrobatics and synchronized water dances added flair.

Anne Hidalgo, Paris mayor, praised the show's creativity and boldness. Despite the rain and challenges, the ceremony celebrated shared humanity and resilience.
