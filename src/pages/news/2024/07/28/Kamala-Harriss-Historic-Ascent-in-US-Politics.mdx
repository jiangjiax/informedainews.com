Kamala Harris stepped into the spotlight as the Democratic nominee for president, following Joe Biden's withdrawal. Her ascent marked a pivotal shift in US politics, symbolizing a generational handoff.

Biden's endorsement, coupled with support from key Democratic figures like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, solidified her position. Harris's campaign quickly mobilized, leveraging Biden's campaign resources and a substantial war chest.

Her message focused on moving forward, contrasting with Trump's past policies. Harris addressed diverse audiences, from historically Black sororities to teachers, emphasizing opportunity and progress.

Internationally, she met with Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and addressed ongoing conflicts, promising a vocal stance on human rights.

Fundraising surged, setting records with over $81 million in a single day, highlighting grassroots support. The campaign's energy drew younger voters, a demographic notably absent in previous campaigns.

Harris's trajectory from vice-president to presidential nominee unfolded rapidly, capturing the nation's attention and setting the stage for a historic election.
