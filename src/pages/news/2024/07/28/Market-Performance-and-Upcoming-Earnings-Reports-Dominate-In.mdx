The market had a rough week, but Friday's rally eased some pain. The Dow and Russell 2000 outperformed, shifting focus from market favorites to underdogs. Health care, materials, and utilities sectors led gains; communication services and tech lagged.

Economic data showed stronger U.S. growth and steady inflation, supporting potential Federal Reserve rate cuts. Housing market weakness also hinted at rate reductions.

Earnings-wise, Danaher and Dover impressed, while Ford disappointed, seeing a 20% stock drop. Alphabet and Honeywell faced post-earnings sell-offs despite positive results.

Upcoming earnings from major companies like Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon will be crucial. Key points include Microsoft's Azure cloud growth and AI investments, Apple's guidance ahead of the iPhone 16 launch, and Amazon's logistics costs.

Overall, the market's performance and upcoming earnings reports will heavily influence investor sentiment and stock movements.
