Zhengzhou University Hospital has successfully conducted the world's first experimental removal of ECMO from an artificial womb. A fetal lamb survived for 90 minutes outside the mother's body. The technology simulates the uterine environment and theoretically allows men to become pregnant. The core principle: the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation system replaces the placental function, providing oxygen and nutrients, and eliminating waste. In the experiment, early embryos developed well within the artificial womb. This technology brings new possibilities for future reproductive methods, but more research is needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness.
