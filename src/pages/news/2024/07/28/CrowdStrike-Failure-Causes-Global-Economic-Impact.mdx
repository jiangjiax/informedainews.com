CrowdStrike's recent failure impacted 850,000 Windows devices, resulting in a global loss of $150 billion. Insurance, provided by Parametrix, covered only $15-$30 billion. The hardest-hit sectors were airlines and healthcare, with respective losses of $1.48 billion and $19.4 billion. Microsoft anticipates full recovery will take several weeks. CrowdStrike's CEO, George Kurtz, issued an apology for the disruption.
