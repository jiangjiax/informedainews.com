UK plans a major push for offshore wind. A new state-owned company, Great British Energy, is leading the initiative. It has received Â£8.3 billion from taxpayers. The goal is to achieve a zero-carbon grid by 2030. The company is partnering with the Crown Estate, which owns the UK seabed. They hope to attract private funds. Additionally, three new solar farms have been approved, and the ban on onshore wind has been lifted. Prime Minister Keir Starmer aims to win the clean energy race.
