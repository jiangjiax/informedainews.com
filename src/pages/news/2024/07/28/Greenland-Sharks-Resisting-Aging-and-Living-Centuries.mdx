Greenland sharks live over 270 years, some possibly reaching 500. They swim deep in Arctic waters, moving slowly. Unlike other animals, their metabolisms do not slow with age. Ewan Camplisson, a biologist, found no metabolic decline in sharks aged 60 to 200.

These sharks mature late, at about 150 years, and live long in cold, deep waters with few predators. Camplisson suspects their slow growth and low mortality help them survive harsh Arctic conditions.

He plans to study their tissues to understand their anti-aging metabolisms. This research could help improve human health in old age.
