Japanese researchers have discovered a new form of ice, dubbed "Ice 0," which forms crystals in supercooled water. This discovery, detailed in Nature Communications, resolves a long-standing debate about where ice nucleatesâ€”at surfaces or within water.

Traditionally, ice nucleation occurs at the interface of liquid and solid. However, this study demonstrates that it can also take place below the water surface, near air. Ice 0 precursors, which have ring-like structures similar to Ice 0, facilitate this process.

These precursors form due to water's surface tension, creating a negative pressure. They quickly rearrange into common Ice I once crystallization begins.

The findings are significant. Understanding how ice forms can impact climate research and food science. It could also benefit meteorology, where Ice 0-like precursors might affect cloud droplets.

Overall, this research deepens our understanding of ice's complexity and its varied impacts across disciplines.
