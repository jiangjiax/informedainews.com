Google's latest update simplifies call and Wi-Fi sharing across Android devices. Users can group phones, tablets, and Chromebooks to share calls and hotspots effortlessly. Call Casting, using Google Meet, allows moving calls between devices. Automatic hotspot connections eliminate password entry. Samsung devices are excluded from Google's sharing features, continuing with their own system. This update aligns Android more closely with Apple's Handoff, enhancing device integration.
