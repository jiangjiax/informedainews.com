Executives from Blizzard Entertainment's "World of Warcraft" team recently visited China, expressing a cautious and humble approach towards returning to the Chinese market. Executive Producer Holly Longdale and Game Senior Director Ion Hazzikostas were interviewed at the ChinaJoy Expo, emphasizing a more open and proactive stance to involve Chinese players in global dialogues.

Hazzikostas mentioned that the enthusiasm of Chinese players made them feel humble, and they plan to develop unique gameplay for the Chinese region, closely collaborating with NetEase. "World of Warcraft" will globally launch "The War Within" simultaneously, ensuring that Chinese players do not fall behind.

"Hearthstone" is also scheduled to return to China on September 25th. Executive Producer Nathan Lyons-Smith stated that special rewards will be provided to attract players back. The team has conducted multiple playtest sessions to ensure a smooth return.

Blizzard's collaboration with NetEase will continue, with Lyons-Smith emphasizing the reliance on NetEase to understand the local market and player community. Blizzard Entertainment's games will gradually return to the Chinese mainland market this summer.
