Scientists at Columbia University have developed a compact optical system that generates ultra-low noise microwave signals. This system fits on a tiny chip, just 1 mm square and 400 microns thick. It sets a new record for low noise at -128dBc/Hz at 10kHz offset frequency.

The system uses a single laser to produce high-quality, low-noise microwave signals. This is a breakthrough for applications like autonomous driving, wireless communication, and precision measurement. In cars, it improves radar accuracy, helping to predict object movement. In communication, it boosts data capacity and efficiency.

The technology leverages optical frequencies, which are much higher than microwave frequencies. This allows for lower noise compared to traditional electronic methods. The system automatically synchronizes optical and microwave signals without additional measurements or corrections, inspired by fireflies' synchronized flashing.

This research opens new possibilities for signal generation and synchronization. Future work aims to further reduce noise and improve performance, potentially surpassing current noise limits.
