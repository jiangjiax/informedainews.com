Rapido, an eight-year-old bike-taxi startup, has achieved unicorn status with a $120 million Series E funding round led by WestBridge Capital. Valued at $1 billion, it competes with Uber and Ola in India's mobility sector. Swiggy, a major food delivery company, supported Rapido in its previous funding round and intends to increase its investment following an IPO. Rapido's emphasis on two-wheelers, as opposed to cabs, addresses India's urban congestion and widespread motorcycle usage. This approach positions it favorably against conventional cab services.
