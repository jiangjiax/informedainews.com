MacArthur Flournoy, 64, diagnosed with HIV in 1988, was told he had two years to live. Today, he's a grandfather living fully in Sacramento. HIV, once a death sentence, is now manageable with antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART prevents HIV-related deaths if taken consistently.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) drugs prevent HIV infection if taken as directed. PrEP is a daily pill or injection, while PEP is a 28-day course started within 72 hours of exposure. Both are free or covered by insurance.

Despite these advances, African Americans face higher HIV rates and lower PrEP usage. In 2022, they accounted for 39% of new HIV cases but only 14% of PrEP users. White Americans, by contrast, made up 24% of new cases and 64% of PrEP users.

Health experts call for increased awareness and access to testing and treatments. They stress the importance of knowing one's HIV status to take control of health. The goal is to reduce new HIV infections by 75% by 2025 and 90% by 2030, but progress has been slow.

Racism and implicit bias in healthcare contribute to these disparities. Efforts to address these issues must be accelerated. Education on racial biases in healthcare is crucial to improve outcomes for communities of color.
