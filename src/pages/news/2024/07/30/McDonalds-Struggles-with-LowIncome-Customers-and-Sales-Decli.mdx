McDonald's is facing challenges. Sales have declined, particularly among low-income customers. They are promoting a $5 meal deal in an effort to regain their patronage. Joe Erlinger, the head of McDonald's USA, acknowledges that this is a strategic, long-term approach. They need to demonstrate that they are mindful of prices.

The $5 meal has been well-received, especially by low-income patrons. McDonald's is extending the offer beyond its initial four-week period. The majority of their restaurants are participating.

Erlinger concedes that business is not thriving. Customer numbers have fallen for the fourth consecutive quarter. They are losing market share to rivals. However, he remains optimistic. They have strategies in place for the remainder of the year, and upcoming decisions could potentially reverse the trend.

McDonald's has traditionally focused on providing value. Now, they must reinforce this commitment. They are engaging with customers and striving to narrow the affordability gap. The market is competitive, but McDonald's is committed to the long-term success of the business.
