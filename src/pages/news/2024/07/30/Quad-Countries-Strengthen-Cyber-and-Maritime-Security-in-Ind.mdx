Foreign ministers from Australia, India, Japan, and the U.S. met in Tokyo. They agreed to boost cyber and maritime security in the Indo-Pacific. Antony Blinken called it "a moment of unprecedented strategic alignment."

They're worried about the East and South China seas. No names, but tensions with China are clear. Beijing's military drills around Taiwan and joint exercises with Russia in the South China Sea are concerns.

The Quad countries also see North Korea and Russia as threats. They aim for a "free and open" Indo-Pacific, where no country dominates.

Key moves:
- Strengthening undersea cable networks.
- Expanding maritime domain awareness.
- Streamlining disaster response.

Australia launched a Cable Connectivity and Resilience Center. The U.S. plans to train over 1,000 telecom officials in the region.

The Quad finalized humanitarian aid and disaster relief procedures. They supported ASEAN and Pacific island countries.

Japan and the U.S. also agreed to closer defense collaboration, focusing on Japan's southwestern islands near Taiwan.
