EU plans trade strategy for Trump's potential second term. Aims to avoid past conflicts. Two-step plan: first, negotiate increased US product purchases; second, prepare for 50%+ retaliatory tariffs if talks fail. EU emphasizes partnership, not confrontation. Dombrovskis stresses cooperation but readiness to defend interests. Trump's 2018 tariffs sparked initial EU retaliation.
