Christa Deguchi, born in Japan, claimed Canada's first Olympic judo gold. She topped the world rankings and defeated Mimi Huh in a tense final, winning on penalties in overtime. Deguchi's victory avenged a previous loss to Huh at the 2024 world championships. Despite her global standing, securing her spot at the Paris Games wasn't straightforward; she had to surpass fellow Canadian and world No. 2, Jessica Klimkait. Deguchi trains in Japan and competes for Canada through her Canadian father.
