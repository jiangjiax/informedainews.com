Brain-controlled bionic leg boosts amputees' speed and ease of movement. Trial results show 41% faster walking and better stair navigation.

The device uses the wearer's thoughts to flex, point, and rotate the foot, resulting in a more natural gait and improved stability on uneven terrain.

Prof Hugh Herr, co-director of MIT's K Lisa Yang Center for Bionics, leads the study. Herr, a double amputee, plans to use the technology himself.

Trial participants reported less pain and muscle atrophy, feeling that their prosthetic was part of their body, not just a tool.

A new surgery, the agonist-antagonist myoneural interface (AMI), preserves muscle connections, allowing the monitoring and translation of muscle contractions into ankle movements.

Dr. Sigrid Dupan, from University College Dublin, highlights the significance of terrain adaptability.

The MIT team aims to commercialize the leg within five years, with Herr envisioning a major step-change in clinical care for amputees worldwide.
