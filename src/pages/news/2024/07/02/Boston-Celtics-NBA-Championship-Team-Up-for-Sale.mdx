Boston Celtics, NBA champions, are up for sale. The ownership group plans to sell all shares by 2024-2025, with the final sale expected in 2028. With 18 NBA titles, the Celtics could be valued at over $4 billion, similar to the Phoenix Suns' sale in 2023. Wyc Grousbeck, who purchased the team for $360 million in 2002, will remain as governor until 2028.

Sports team valuations are skyrocketing due to high media rights. The NBA's media rights negotiations are ongoing, with NBCUniversal, ESPN, and Amazon among the bidders. Live sports continue to draw large TV audiences.

Insight: The Celtics' sale mirrors a trend in high-value sports team transactions, fueled by lucrative media rights and fan engagement. Selling post-championship maximizes potential buyer interest and valuation.
