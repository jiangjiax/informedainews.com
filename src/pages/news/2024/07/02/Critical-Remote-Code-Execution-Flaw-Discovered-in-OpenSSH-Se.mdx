Qualys has identified a critical flaw in OpenSSH servers, known as "RegreSSHion." This vulnerability enables remote code execution without the need for authentication. It affects various versions on Linux systems and arises from a race condition in the signal handler. Exploiting this issue can lead to system takeover, installation of malware, and tampering with data. Attackers may also use compromised systems to propagate within networks.
