Biniam Girmay, an Eritrean cyclist, made history by winning the third stage of the Tour de France, becoming the first Black African to do so. His victory, he said, was for all Africans, signaling a significant moment for the continent in the world of cycling.

Girmay had previously made headlines by winning a stage at the Giro dâ€™Italia, another prestigious race, but his celebration was cut short when a prosecco cork struck his eye, necessitating hospitalization and forcing him to withdraw from the race.

In this Tour de France stage, Girmay edged out Fernando Gaviria and Arnaud De Lie in a close finish. Meanwhile, Mark Cavendish, aiming for a record-breaking 35th stage win, was delayed by a crash but maintained his position due to race rules.

Richard Carapaz, an Olympic champion, took the yellow jersey, becoming the first Ecuadorean to lead the race.
