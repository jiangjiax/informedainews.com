Li Auto leads when including hybrids, with 188,981 vehicles delivered in the first half. Most Li cars feature a fuel tank for extended range. Huawei's Aito brand, also offering hybrids, delivered 184,286 vehicles.

Xiaomi, known for smartphones and home appliances, entered the EV market in late March with its electric SUV, the SU7, delivering over 25,000 units. BYD delivered 1.6 million new energy vehicles, with hybrids slightly outpacing battery-only cars.

China's new energy vehicle sales rose to 47% of all passenger car sales in May, up from 32% at the start of the year. Range anxiety remains a concern, prompting calls for improved battery charging processes.

China has introduced a trade-in policy to boost new energy vehicle sales, while many companies have cut prices and unveiled new models to stay competitive.
