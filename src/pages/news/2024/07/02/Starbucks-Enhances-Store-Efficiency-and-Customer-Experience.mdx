Starbucks is rolling out the Siren Craft System, aiming to speed up service and ease barista workloads. Over 10% of their 10,000 stores have adopted it so far. The system changes drink production order, prioritizing hot drinks earlier to prevent bottlenecks.

The company also plans to introduce a "play caller" role, akin to a restaurant expediter, to manage logjams and unexpected rushes. This role will focus on tasks like restocking and crowd management.

Starbucks is also tweaking its app to open mobile ordering to non-rewards members, hoping to boost traffic and sales. This move comes as they face declining same-store sales and customer traffic.

The Siren Craft System and app changes are part of a broader effort to improve efficiency and customer experience, crucial as Starbucks navigates a challenging economic environment and consumer cost consciousness.
