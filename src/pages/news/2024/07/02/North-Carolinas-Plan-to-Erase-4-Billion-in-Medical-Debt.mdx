North Carolina plans to eliminate $4 billion in medical debt for 2 million residents. Governor Roy Cooper's proposal offers hospitals additional federal Medicaid funds if they cancel old debts and assist future patients with discounts. Hospitals must also cease selling debt to collectors and cap interest rates.

The plan does not require the state to spend extra funds and needs federal approval. If approved, hospitals could receive up to $6.5 billion next year. Benefits for patients would commence in 2025-2026.

This initiative focuses on long-term debt relief, contrasting with one-time federal fund usage by other states. It supports low- and middle-income families, potentially stimulating the state's economy.

**Explanation of Terms:**
- **Medicaid Reimbursement Funds:** Money provided by the federal government to states to assist in covering healthcare services for low-income individuals.
- **Charity Care Programs:** Services provided by hospitals at reduced costs or free of charge to patients who cannot afford care.
