Hurricane Beryl, a Category 3 storm, targets the southeast Caribbean. It's the earliest Category 4 Atlantic hurricane on record, fueled by unusually warm waters. Hurricane warnings cover Barbados, Grenada, St. Lucia, Tobago, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves of St. Vincent and the Grenadines urges residents to stay indoors.

Beryl's winds peak at 120 mph, moving west at 20 mph. It's compact, with hurricane-force winds extending 35 miles from its center. Tropical storm warnings are in effect for Martinique and Trinidad, with watches issued for Dominica and Haiti’s southern coast.

Forecasters predict a life-threatening storm surge up to 9 feet, with heavy rainfall potentially reaching 10 inches in some areas, especially in Grenada and the Grenadines. The National Hurricane Center warns of a very dangerous situation.

Beryl is expected to weaken slightly but remain a significant hurricane as it moves across the Caribbean, potentially impacting Jamaica and Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula. Officials in affected areas have shut down electricity, warned of water outages, and closed schools, airports, and government offices.

Beryl strengthened rapidly, becoming a major hurricane in just 42 hours, a rare feat in Atlantic hurricane history. Its formation is linked to record-warm waters, hotter than typical peak hurricane season temperatures.

As Beryl approaches, residents and visitors brace for impact, with many fearing the worst despite preparations. The storm underscores the heightened threat of hurricane activity this season, with NOAA predicting well above-average activity.
