Google has launched an AI-powered video editing app called Google Vids, which is now in the testing phase. The app integrates the Gemini large model, allowing users to create slideshows, write scripts, and access materials from Shutterstock. Editing features include adding or removing slides, text, images, and audio, with the final output being an MP4 file. Currently, Google Vids lacks AI dubbing functionality.
