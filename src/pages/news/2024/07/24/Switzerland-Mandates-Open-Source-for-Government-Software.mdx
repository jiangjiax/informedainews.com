Switzerland enacted the EMBAG law in 2023, which mandates that government software be open source. This means the code is publicly accessible, with the goal of enhancing transparency and security. The initiative began in 2011 with the release of court case software. The law also makes non-sensitive government data publicly available. This development could establish a benchmark for other nations, fostering digital openness and innovation.

Open Source Software (OSS): Software whose code is accessible for anyone to inspect, modify, and improve.

Open Government Data (OGD): Non-sensitive, non-personal government data that is publicly available.
