Mattel, the US toymaker, has launched its first blind Barbie. This initiative aims to make its product line more inclusive for blind and low-vision children. The doll comes with a white and red cane, a distinctive eye gaze, and tactile clothing. The packaging also includes braille.

Krista Berger, senior vice-president of Barbie, highlighted the doll's significance in promoting self-expression and a sense of belonging. Mattel worked with the American Foundation for the Blind to ensure accurate representation.

Lucy Edwards, a blind disability activist, commended the doll, reflecting on her own teenage experiences of isolation and the potential positive influence of such a role model. The Royal National Institute of Blind People also supports the launch, emphasizing the importance of representation.

In addition to the blind Barbie, Mattel introduced a black doll with Downâ€™s syndrome, following the release of a white version the previous year. This doll showcases physical characteristics of the condition and features braided hair texture.

Both dolls are part of the Barbie Fashionistas range, which has expanded to include various body types, skin tones, and hairstyles. The range also features a doll with a prosthetic leg, a wheelchair user, and a deaf Barbie.
