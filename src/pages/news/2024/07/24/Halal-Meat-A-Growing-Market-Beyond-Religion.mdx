Halal meat is a significant issue. It's not just about religion; it's a $3.3 trillion market growing rapidly. Muslims require halal food, but so do many non-Muslims. Halal, meaning "permitted" in Arabic, involves specific slaughter rules for meat.

Cluck N Cleaver, a fried chicken chain, transitioned to halal for improved quality and to attract more customers. They found a trustworthy halal supplier. Prices remained consistent, and they maintained their diverse menu.

KFC experimented with halal in Ontario and encountered backlash. Some believed it was exclusively for Muslims. Other chains like Popeye's and Mary Brown's also provide halal options.

Boston Pizza has offered halal options for a decade. Salima Jivraj, a halal consumer, notes that halal meat is identical to regular meat. A decade ago, halal options were scarce. Now, they are ubiquitous.

Maple Lodge Farms, a major halal meat supplier, observes increasing demand. Omar Subedar from the Halal Monitoring Authority states that halal certification can be costly but is worthwhile for the market share.

More companies are adopting halal, expanding choices for businesses like Cluck N Cleaver. Halal is here to stay, and it benefits everyone.
