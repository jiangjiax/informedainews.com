Inbrain Neuroelectronics is preparing a graphene brain implant for human trials this summer. Targeted at treating Parkinson's disease, the device utilizes graphene, a pure carbon material, instead of traditional metal electrodes. Graphene is resistant to degradation in brain fluids, enhances charge capacity by 200 times, and allows for precise communication with individual neurons. The chip, only 10 micrometers thick, features a wirelessly charged neural processor. Preliminary tests on animals have been successful, setting the stage for potential advancements in neurological treatments.
