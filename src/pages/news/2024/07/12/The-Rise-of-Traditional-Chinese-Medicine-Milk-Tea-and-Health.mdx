Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) milk tea and health-preserving meals are rapidly gaining popularity. The "Wu Mei Tang 2.0" from Zhejiang Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine sold 1.15 million servings within 24 hours, sparking heated market discussions. TCM milk tea combines medicinal and edible ingredients such as wu mei (smoked plum), lotus leaf, and hawthorn, imbuing the奶茶 with health-preserving properties. Brands like "Kai Le Ge Fang Zi," Chun Feng, and Qing Nan Wu Wei Cha have secured their place in the market with unique positioning and high-quality products.

TCM-infused meals extend beyond milk tea to include baking, bread, and desserts. Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine's "Health-Preserving European Buns" and Zhang Zhongjing Pharmacy's "Health-Preserving Bakery" integrate TCM elements into traditional baking, offering products like Ejiao Soft European Buns and Astragalus Health-Preserving Buns. Tongrentang's Nanjing TCM Bakery offers health-preserving stews like Roselle and Smoked Plum Drink, which are popular among young people.

The surge in TCM-inspired dining is driven by the growing health-conscious needs of young people. The "Z Generation Nutrition Consumption Trends Report" indicates that 18-35-year-olds are the main consumers of health-preserving products, accounting for 83.7% of the market. The rise of health-preserving meals is also evident in areas like health-preserving hot pot and health-preserving coffee. Lao Wang's Pig Intestine Chicken Hot Pot and Coconut Chicken Hot Pot, along with medicinal hot pots that incorporate TCM ingredients, represent new trends in health-preserving dining.

In summary, the rise of TCM-infused dining is a product of the fusion between health-preserving culture and modern consumer demands. With increasing health awareness, TCM-inspired dining is expected to continue expanding its market influence.
