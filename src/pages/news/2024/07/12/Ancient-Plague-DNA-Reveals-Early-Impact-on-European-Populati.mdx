New research from Copenhagen and Gothenburg universities suggests that the plague, which later devastated Europe in the 14th century, may have significantly impacted populations much earlier, around 5000 years ago.

Analyzing DNA from 108 ancient individuals in Swedish passage graves, researchers found that 18 (17%) had died from the plague. This challenges previous beliefs that the plague only caused major epidemics in the Middle Ages.

The study, employing a method known as "deep shotgun sequencing," enabled detailed analysis of degraded ancient DNA. It revealed a detailed lineage of the plague and other microbes, providing insights into societal structures and diseases of the time.

This discovery suggests that the plague could have been a key factor in the decline of Neolithic populations in Scandinavia and northwest Europe.
