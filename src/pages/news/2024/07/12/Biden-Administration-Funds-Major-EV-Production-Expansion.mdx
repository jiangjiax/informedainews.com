The Biden administration is allocating nearly $1.1 billion to General Motors and Stellantis. This funding is intended to transform outdated plants into electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing facilities. The Department of Energy is spearheading this initiative, with a total of $1.7 billion designated for 11 plants in eight states.

The objective is to produce a million EVs annually, preserve 15,000 jobs, and create 3,000 new positions. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm views this as a pivotal component of Biden's industrial strategy, aimed at modernizing conventional auto plants.

General Motors receives $500 million to convert its Lansing Grand River Assembly Plant in Michigan. Stellantis is awarded $334.8 million for its Belvidere Assembly plant and $250 million for its Indiana Transmission Plant, both slated for EV production.

Other companies are also benefiting from this initiative. Hyundai Mobis, Harley-Davidson, Blue Bird, and Cummins are all receiving funds to enhance their EV capabilities.

The Department of Energy must still conclude negotiations and conduct environmental reviews before the funds are disbursed. However, the plan is evident: to steer America towards greater electrification and reduced emissions.
