Autonomous vehicles in Wuhan have become a sensation. Baidu's Robo-Taxi, an autonomous driving mobility platform, has sparked a热潮 in Wuhan. The service has not only received high praise from domestic users but has also earned rave reviews from overseas bloggers.

Operational data from Robo-Taxi in Wuhan shows that user satisfaction is as high as 4.9 out of 5, with a perfect score rate of 94.19%. Wuhan residents have shown a high acceptance of autonomous vehicles, with peak orders per vehicle exceeding 20 per day.

The introduction of the sixth-generation autonomous vehicle has significantly reduced costs, with an invoice price of only 204,600 yuan, less than half that of the previous generation. The vehicle's design has shifted focus to enhance rear-seat comfort.

Baidu Apollo plans to achieve break-even in Wuhan by the end of this year and aims for full profitability by 2025. Autonomous driving technology is gradually becoming commercialized, improving the travel experience for ordinary people.

Wuhan's practices have demonstrated China's leading position in the field of autonomous driving. This leadership has been achieved through data, operations, and implementation. Autonomous driving, as a significant application of AI technology, showcases China's innovation and technological prowess.

The success of Robo-Taxi not only provides local residents with low-carbon, economical, and safe travel options but also sets a benchmark for the global autonomous driving industry.
