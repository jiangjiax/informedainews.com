The Ambani wedding, son of Asia's richest man, Mukesh Ambani, has drawn global attention. Over four months, lavish events led up to the marriage of Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant. The festivities included high-profile performances and guests like Rihanna, Mark Zuckerberg, and Bill Gates.

Critics argue the opulence contrasts sharply with India's widespread poverty. Writer Santosh Desai notes the wedding reflects a broader trend where wealth is flaunted openly, though the scale remains exceptional.

The Ambanis, with businesses spanning oil, telecom, and more, are central figures in India. Mukesh's fortune stands at $115 billion. The wedding's extravagance has sparked debates on wealth display versus societal needs.
