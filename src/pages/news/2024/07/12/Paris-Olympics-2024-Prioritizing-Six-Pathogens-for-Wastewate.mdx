In a study for the 2024 Paris Olympics, researchers identified six key pathogens to monitor through wastewater. These include poliovirus and SARS-CoV-2. The selection was based on practicality and relevance, establishing a precedent for future large events.

The French National Institute of Public Health spearheaded this research, aiming to identify critical pathogens during the Olympics and Paralympics. They employed the Delphi method, combining reviewed evidence and expert opinions, to choose these pathogens based on their analytical feasibility, relevance to the Olympics, and public health significance.

Wastewater surveillance (WWS) gained prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is non-invasive, cost-effective, and provides data regardless of symptoms or testing behavior. This makes it a valuable early warning system.

The selected pathogens are poliovirus, influenza A and B, measles, SARS-CoV-2, and another strain of measles. These were chosen based on three criteria: analytical feasibility, relevance to the 2024 Paris Olympics, and their impact on public health policy.

Initially, a list of 60 pathogens was compiled. This was narrowed down to 25 based on evidence from reviewed publications. A panel of 32 experts further refined this list, reaching a 70% consensus. Measles, initially excluded, was added due to its resurgence and potential risk during the Olympics.

WWS is not new but has gained momentum post-COVID-19. This study sets a framework for targeting WWS in large gatherings. If successful, it could encourage similar strategies in future events.

Further work is needed before implementing this strategy at the 2024 Paris Olympics. This includes optimizing lab methods and refining sampling strategies. The plan is to use a network of 54 sites across France to monitor SARS-CoV-2 and pilot the monitoring of measles and influenza viruses in Paris's wastewater.
