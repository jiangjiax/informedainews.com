Helsing, a defense AI firm, has just raised $487 million. They are expanding into Estonia with the aim of strengthening defenses against Russia. This move aligns with NATO's concerns over the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Helsing's technology enhances drone and jet fighter capabilities and assists in battlefield decision-making. They have partnered with Airbus and several defense ministries.

Gundbert Scherf, co-CEO of the company, views their technology as essential for defending European democracies. Estonia's Prime Minister, Kaja Kallas, welcomes Helsing's presence.

Torsten Reil, Helsing's co-CEO, emphasizes the urgency to create a "capability gap" to deter and defend against potential broader threats.

The firm utilizes its own compute resources and some from unnamed third parties for security reasons. They are also working on Project Centaur, an AI for air combat that employs reinforcement learning.

This latest funding values Helsing at approximately $5.4 billion. Investors include Spotify's Daniel Ek and Saab AB.

Defense technology is gaining momentum with Western investors, reflecting increasing defense budgets. Helsing stands out as a significant European player in this field.
