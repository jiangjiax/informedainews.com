China's latest food safety scandal erupted days before a crucial party meeting. State-run Beijing News exposed fuel tankers used to transport cooking oil without proper cleaning. These tankers, previously carrying coal-derived fuel, traveled over 800 miles from Ningxia to Qinhuangdao, loading soybean oil without disinfection.

The scandal implicates major firms like Sinograin and Hopefull Grain and Oil Group. Both claim to be investigating. The food safety commission promises severe punishment for law violations. Regulations mandate separate tankers for fuel and cooking oil, highlighting a gap in enforcement.

The Beijing News report suggests contaminated oil might reach consumers, packaged under household brands, even exported. Public outrage is high, fueled by past scandals like the 2008 baby formula tragedy and the 2013 Huangpu River dead pigs incident.

Journalistic exposure of this scandal contrasts with a decade of shrinking independent reporting space in China. Hashtags and mentions of specific companies on Weibo, China's Twitter, face censorship. Jinlongyu, a implicated brand, saw its parent company's shares drop 8%, despite claims of compliance.
