China is constructing 339GW of wind and solar power, nearly double the total of the rest of the world. By 2024, they plan to reach 1,200GW, six years ahead of schedule. This rapid expansion positions China significantly ahead in the renewable energy sector. Gigawatts (GW) are units that measure power capacity; one gigawatt can supply approximately 725,000 homes. China's ambitious efforts could significantly alter global energy trends.
