U.S. Justice Department disrupted a Russian-backed disinformation campaign. Nearly 1,000 fake social media accounts seized. Campaign used AI to spread falsehoods about Russia's war in Ukraine.

Operation led by a senior editor at RT, a Russian state-funded media outlet. Supported financially by the Kremlin, with oversight from Russiaâ€™s Federal Security Service (FSB).

Campaign aimed to sow discord in the U.S. and influence public opinion. Similar to past efforts in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

FBI Director Christopher Wray called it a first in disrupting a Russian-sponsored AI-enhanced social media bot farm.

Justice Department also seized two domain names and accounts on X, formerly Twitter.

FBI collaborated with Canadian and Dutch cyber security forces on this operation.
