Cypress Hill, a hip-hop group, is set to perform with the London Symphony Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall. This collaboration stems from a 1996 Simpsons episode where the band mistakenly believed they booked the LSO while under the influence.

The performance celebrates the 30th anniversary of Cypress Hill's Black Sunday album, which sold over three million copies in the US and spent a year on the UK charts. The LSO will play orchestral arrangements of songs like "Insane in the Brain" and "I Wanna Get High."

Cypress Hill, with over 20 million albums sold worldwide, considers this event a milestone in their career. B-Real, a band member, expressed the significance of this collaboration, acknowledging the influence of The Simpsons episode in making it happen.

The Simpsons has a history of predicting future events, adding a layer of serendipity to this musical union. Whether by coincidence or not, Cypress Hill sees this performance as their destiny.
