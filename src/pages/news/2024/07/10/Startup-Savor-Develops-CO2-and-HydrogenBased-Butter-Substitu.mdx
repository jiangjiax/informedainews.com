Savor, a startup, utilizes CO2 and hydrogen to produce a butter-like fat. Bill Gates has provided funding for the company. Their technology bypasses animal and plant sources, thereby reducing environmental impact. The process involves heating CO2 and hydrogen to create fat. Gates views this technology as having potential for achieving climate goals. The main challenges are making it affordable and persuading consumers. Savor's method is efficient, using minimal water and no farmland. The final product tastes authentic because it is chemically identical to traditional fats. This has been published in Nature Sustainability.
