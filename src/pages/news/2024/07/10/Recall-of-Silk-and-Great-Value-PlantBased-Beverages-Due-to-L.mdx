Fifteen Silk and Great Value plant-based beverages, all in large packages, have been recalled across Canada. The products, made by Danone Canada, include almond and coconut drinks in various flavors. The recall extends to specific best before dates up to October 4, 2024.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) linked these products to a food-borne illness outbreak. Symptoms of listeria infection include vomiting, nausea, fever, aching, headache, and a stiff neck. Listeria, though less common than salmonella or E. coli, has a high mortality rate, especially among the elderly and pregnant women.

Siyun Wang, a food safety expert, noted that pathogens like listeria may thrive better in plant-based milks compared to cow's milk. Danone Canada stated the contamination originated from a production line at a third-party Ontario manufacturer. The company is conducting a thorough investigation and has initiated a swift recall to protect consumers.
