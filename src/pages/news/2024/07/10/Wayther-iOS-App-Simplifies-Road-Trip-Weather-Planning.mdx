Wayther, an iOS app developed by Axel Le Pennec, streamlines road trip planning by integrating real-time weather and road conditions. Inspired by a feature in Le Pennec's boating app, Skipper, Wayther delivers route-specific weather forecasts for up to 10 days in advance.

Users can choose their routes, modify travel schedules, and steer clear of unfavorable weather conditions. The app flags severe weather alerts, visibility concerns, and ideal travel times for enjoying scenic routes. Wayther presents three route alternatives, comprehensive weather updates, and an interactive map.

Accessible worldwide where Apple Weather is available, Wayther accommodates various travel modes and unit systems. Upcoming updates are set to introduce additional features such as route history, live updates, and language options.

Wayther offers a free trial with three trips, followed by subscription plans that range from $1.99 per week to $14.99 annually.
