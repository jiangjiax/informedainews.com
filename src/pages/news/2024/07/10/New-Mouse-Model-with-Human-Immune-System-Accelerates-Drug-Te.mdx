Scientists have created a mouse with a human immune system, named THX. This mouse responds to drugs as a human would, potentially accelerating drug testing and enhancing safety.

Previously, mice used in research had immune systems distinct from humans. THX addresses this by incorporating human lymph nodes, T and B cells, and other components, effectively creating a miniature human within a mouse's form.

The team developed THX by injecting human stem cells into a specific type of mouse and using hormones to facilitate cell growth. Currently, they are investigating how THX reacts to viruses such as SARS-CoV-2.

This mouse could potentially replace tests on other animals and aid in the development of new vaccines and cancer treatments. The research represents a significant advancement in medical science.
