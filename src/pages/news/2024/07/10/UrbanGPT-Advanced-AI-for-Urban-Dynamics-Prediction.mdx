The HKU team has developed UrbanGPT, a large-scale model for predicting urban dynamics. It can forecast traffic patterns, population movements, and crime rates by analyzing spatiotemporal data, offering new approaches for urban planning and management.

The core advantage of UrbanGPT lies in its ability to handle scarce data and diverse scenarios. Through pre-training and a flexible neural network architecture, it overcomes the limitations of traditional methods, enhancing prediction accuracy and generalization capabilities.

Its applications are extensive, including smart city planning, traffic management, safety emergencies, energy conservation and environmental protection, social welfare, and crime prevention. In the future, the team plans to expand the data scope, add multi-modal support, enhance interpretability and user interactivity, and continuously optimize model performance.

In summary, UrbanGPT is a key tool for urban intelligence, facilitating more efficient, safe, and sustainable urban development through precise prediction and analysis.
