Spotify introduces podcast comments, allowing listeners to comment on episodes to foster community. Creators can like, respond, and manage which comments are displayed.

In competition with YouTube, Spotify expands to include video podcasts, with over 250,000 now available. Interactive features such as polls and Q&As have seen a 9 million increase in user engagement.

Engaged listeners are more likely to return frequently and listen to more podcasts. Over 70% of listeners desire more engagement options.

Commenting is optional for hosts. Spotify adopts a cautious approach, balancing creative freedom with safety. Creators can enable or disable comments on a per-episode basis and approve them.

Spotify is testing automated moderation to simplify manual approval processes. Measures such as blocking commenters and policy checks are implemented.

The beta testing of comments received positive feedback. Spotify has transitioned from an exclusive content provider to a profitable platform for all podcasters.

There are no immediate plans for monetizing comments, but there is potential for features like fan badges similar to YouTube's Super Chat. Comments could enhance app engagement through notifications.

Spotify aims to increase listener engagement further.
