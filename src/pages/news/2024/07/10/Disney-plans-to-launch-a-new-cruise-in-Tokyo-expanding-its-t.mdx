Disney plans to launch a new cruise ship, the ninth, in 2028, capable of accommodating 4000 passengers.
In collaboration with Tokyo Disney, the investment is approximately $20 billion.
The cruise is based on the design of the "Wish" and is expected to generate annual sales of 100 billion yen.
This move is part of Disney's $600 billion expansion plan over ten years.
Currently operating five ships, three more are planned for construction, with one scheduled to set sail in 2025.
