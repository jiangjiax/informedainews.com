Johns Hopkins University will offer free medical school tuition starting fall 2024. This comes after a $1 billion donation from Michael Bloomberg, alumnus and philanthropist. Bloomberg Philanthropies will cover full tuition for students with family incomes under $300,000. Those earning less than $175,000 also get covered living expenses and fees.

Bloomberg, former New York City mayor, aims to address the U.S. shortage of healthcare professionals. High education costs often deter potential students. His donation also extends financial aid to the nursing and public health schools.

This isn't Bloomberg's first major gift to Hopkins. In 2018, he donated $1.8 billion for undergraduate financial aid. Other institutions, like Albert Einstein College of Medicine and New York Universityâ€™s Long Island School of Medicine, have also received significant donations for tuition support.

Bloomberg's latest move could widen access to medical careers, especially for those from lower-income backgrounds. It mirrors the impact of his earlier donation, which enriched the university's student diversity and achievements.
