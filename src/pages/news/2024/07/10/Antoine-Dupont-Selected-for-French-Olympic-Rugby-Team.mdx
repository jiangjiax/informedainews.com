Antoine Dupont, a top rugby player, will compete in the Olympics as part of the French sevens squad. The 27-year-old, known for his prowess in the 15-a-side game, joined the sevens team this year aiming for Olympic gold in Paris. Dupont's performance in three sevens world series tournaments earned him two gold medals and a bronze.

The French men's squad, buoyed by Dupont's presence, won their first world series title in Madrid, defeating Argentina 19-5. This victory followed their earlier win in Los Angeles, marking their first tournament victory in 19 years. The team, ranked fifth before the Madrid finale, beat Fiji and Argentina in the semifinals and final, respectively.

France coach Jerome Daret sees a potential Olympic win on the horizon. Dupont's teammate Paulin Riva credits the player's presence on the pitch for boosting team confidence. The French women's team, runner-up in the world series finals to Australia, also holds strong medal prospects.

The Olympics in Paris will feature new elements, including the debut of breakdance as an official sport. The games, a significant financial and political event, promise a unique spectacle.
