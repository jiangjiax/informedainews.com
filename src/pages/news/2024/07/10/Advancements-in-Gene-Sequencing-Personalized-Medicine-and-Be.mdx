Gene sequencing technology has demonstrated its importance, evolving from the omics technologies of the millennium to applications during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Omics technologies such as glycomics and metabolomics were used during the pandemic to analyze differences between viruses and patients, but their everyday applications are limited due to long detection cycles and complex operations.

Nucleic acid testing, which collects samples via throat or nasal swabs, utilizes DNA amplification and sequencing technologies to rapidly determine results. The field of genomics began with phage sequencing in 1977 and entered the genomic era with the completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003. Technologies such as personal genomics, the $100 genome sequencing, and cancer genomics have driven the development of precision medicine.

Microfluidic technology has reduced sequencing costs, making personal genome sequencing feasible. Single-cell sequencing technology, by sequencing at the individual cell level, has enhanced our understanding of cellular diversity. Companies in China and abroad, such as Singleron and WanCheng Gene, have promoted the clinical application and market expansion of single-cell sequencing technology.

The development of sequencing technology extends beyond medicine, encompassing areas such as data storage and cancer treatment. DNA, as a data storage material, is of great interest due to its high density and low energy consumption. Cancer genomics, by comprehensively analyzing gene mutations, has driven the development of personalized treatments.

The global gene sequencing market continues to expand, with China's market growing at an annual rate of 40%, indicating significant market potential. The advancements in sequencing technology are gradually changing our understanding and approach to health and disease.
