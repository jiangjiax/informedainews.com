NovoNutrients, a startup, aims to convert carbon dioxide into protein using microbes. Founder David Tze plans to establish a pilot plant in the San Francisco Bay Area, funded by an $18 million Series A round led by Woodside Energy and CM Ventures.

The company employs fermentation in thin, looped cylinders, which reduces energy requirements compared to traditional tanks. NovoNutrients customizes microbes to digest various gas mixtures, enhancing stability and efficiency through natural, non-GMO methods.

Rather than operating commercial plants, NovoNutrients will sell microbes and licenses, taking care of marketing and business development. Tze anticipates that the pilot plant will validate the commercial potential of the technology.

Interestingly, Tze has recently focused more on pet food companies, noting a growing interest and spending in pet nutrition. NovoNutrients' protein, new to many pet diets, could appeal to hypoallergenic markets.
