The NWSL championship game hits CPKC Stadium on Nov. 23. This $120 million venue, home to the Kansas City Current, stands as one of the world's first stadiums built specifically for a women's professional team. The Current's perfect attendance record continues, with every match sold out. Last year's championship saw a crowd of 25,011 at Snapdragon Stadium, where NJ/NY Gotham FC clinched their first title. This year, the Current face the Orlando Pride, both teams unbeaten and evenly matched.
