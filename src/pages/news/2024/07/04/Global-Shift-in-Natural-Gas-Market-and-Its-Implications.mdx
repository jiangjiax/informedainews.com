Natural gas is going global. Historically regional, it's now easier to ship worldwide due to liquefaction tech. This shift mirrors oil's global market.

Shehriyar Antia, from PGIM, notes smaller price differences between regions as shipping becomes simpler. Over a decade, liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade nearly doubled.

The U.S. leads in LNG exports, with Cheniere Energy a key player. Cheniere's capacity is massive, making it a top global exporter. Analysts see potential in its stock.

Demand for natural gas surges, especially in China and India, as they shift from coal. LNG is seen as a cleaner alternative, though its environmental impact is debated.

LNG's role in energy security is crucial, notably post-Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The U.S. has stepped in as a major LNG supplier to Europe.

In short, natural gas is evolving into a pivotal global energy source, bridging the gap between traditional fuels and renewables.
