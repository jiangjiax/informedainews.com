X/Twitter plans to add a "dislike" button. This feature, confirmed by X engineers, aims to improve the platform's recommendation algorithm. Users can express disapproval, helping the algorithm gauge content quality. The button's introduction was supported by Elon Musk even before his acquisition of X. The exact design remains unknown, but the functionality is set to roll out soon.
