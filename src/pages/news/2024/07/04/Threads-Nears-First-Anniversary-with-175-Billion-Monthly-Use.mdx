Threads hits 1.75 billion monthly active users as it nears its first anniversary. Launched in 2023, Threads gained traction as an alternative to Elon Musk's restructured X (formerly Twitter). Despite X claiming 6 billion monthly users, Threads' focus on text-based content and integration with Instagram boosts its appeal.

Threads avoids political discourse, positioning itself as a less contentious social platform. Its features, like web apps and edit buttons, aim to enhance user experience without mimicking X's political news focus.
