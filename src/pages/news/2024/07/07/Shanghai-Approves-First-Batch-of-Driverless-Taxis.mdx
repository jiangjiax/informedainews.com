Shanghai has issued the first batch of permits for autonomous taxis to companies including SAIC AI Technology and Baidu Intelligent Driving. These permits are valid until January 4, 2025, and currently offer free trial rides. The companies are preparing their vehicles for an official launch.

Cities like Beijing, Shenzhen, and California have gradually relaxed regulations on autonomous driving. Beijing has approved fully autonomous taxis on the roads, with companies such as Baidu and Pony.ai receiving the go-ahead.

The rapid development of autonomous driving technology, backed by policies in multiple regions, heralds a transformative future for transportation.
