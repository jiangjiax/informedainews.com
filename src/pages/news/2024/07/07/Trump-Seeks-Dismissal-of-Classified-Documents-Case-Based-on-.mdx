Trump's team seeks to leverage a recent Supreme Court ruling granting former presidents immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts. They petitioned Judge Aileen Cannon to dismiss charges related to Trump's handling of classified documents, arguing these acts are protected by immunity.

The Supreme Court's ruling categorizes presidential actions into three groups: those with absolute immunity, presumptive immunity, and no immunity. Trump's lawyers aim to apply this framework to his case, potentially delaying proceedings significantly.

Additionally, they challenge the appointment of Special Counsel Jack Smith, claiming improper authorization by Attorney General Merrick Garland. This dispute adds another layer to the legal complexities, with Justice Clarence Thomas suggesting lower courts should clarify the special counsel's appointment authority.

This maneuver by Trump's legal team underscores the strategic use of legal precedents to challenge and potentially dismantle ongoing prosecutions. The case highlights the intricate interplay between immunity, presidential actions, and the legal mechanisms governing high-level criminal investigations.
