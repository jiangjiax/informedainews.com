Microsoft's stock soared in 2024, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence. Shares reached new highs, up 24% year-to-date. The company's early leadership in AI and the strength of its cloud computing capabilities have attracted investors.

Azure, Microsoft's cloud platform, experienced a 31% surge in revenue, surpassing expectations. AI tools available on Azure are increasingly appealing to developers.

New AI-powered PCs, named Copilot+, were launched in May. These devices, starting at $999, aim to boost Microsoft's personal computing sales.

Copilot, an AI add-on for Microsoft 365, offers subscriptions at $30 per user per month. Analysts predict it could generate over $10 billion by 2026.

Microsoft's significant investment in AI, particularly in OpenAI, positions it strongly. Investors are closely watching for AI revenue growth in upcoming reports. Despite challenges, Microsoft's sustained focus on AI promises future gains.
