New research links GLP-1 receptor agonists to pre-meal fullness via specific brain neurons. These drugs, mimicking a hormone, boost satiety and curb overeating. In trials, GLP-1RA treatment consistently raised fullness scores, contrasting with drops in the control group. The key brain region involved is the dorsomedial hypothalamus, crucial for appetite control.

GLP-1: A hormone signaling fullness post-meal.
GLP-1RA: Synthetic drugs enhancing satiety.
Dorsomedial hypothalamus: A brain area regulating hunger.
