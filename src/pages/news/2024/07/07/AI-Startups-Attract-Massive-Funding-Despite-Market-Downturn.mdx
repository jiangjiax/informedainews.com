Investors have funneled $27.1 billion into AI startups in the U.S. from April to June, representing nearly half of all startup funding during that period. Total U.S. startup funding reached $56 billion, a 57% increase from the previous year. AI startups are flourishing despite a broader startup slump that started in early 2022.

The downturn led to many unprofitable tech startups either cutting costs, selling off, or shutting down. Increasing interest rates steered investors towards safer investments. Startups trimmed their workforce and scaled down their ambitions. However, in late 2022, OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot ignited a new AI surge. Generative AI technology, capable of producing text, images, and videos, spurred the creation and funding of startups.

AI startups invest more in computing costs than non-AI software companies. Kruze Consulting revealed that AI startups allocated 22% of their expenses to computing in the first quarter of the year, more than double the 10% spent by non-AI companies.

Notable startups that received substantial funding include CoreWeave ($1.1 billion), ScaleAI ($1 billion), and Elon Musk's xAI ($6 billion). Investors are optimistic about AI's potential, forecasting that its market could exceed those of the smartphone, personal computer, social media, and the internet.
