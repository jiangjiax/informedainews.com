Bawang Tea姬, a new tea beverage brand, has established its global headquarters in Shanghai. The founder, Zhang Junjie, hails from Yunnan and is self-taught, having started as a milk tea apprentice. He founded the brand in 2017 and now it boasts over 4,500 stores worldwide with a GMV exceeding 10 billion yuan. Bawang Tea姬 chose Shanghai due to its strategic location as a crucial hub connecting China with the rest of the world. The Shanghai government supports businesses going global by providing various services and policy support.

Bawang Tea姬's global expansion strategy reflects a new trend of Chinese enterprises going global. Other new tea brands like Heytea and Nayuki's Tea are also actively expanding into overseas markets. Going global is not only a necessity for brand expansion but also a reflection of Chinese enterprises seeking new opportunities in the global industrial chain restructuring.

The path to going global is fraught with challenges, involving cultural, policy, and institutional tests. However, the internationalization steps of Chinese enterprises are resolute, and there is anticipation for the emergence of more world-class companies in the future.
