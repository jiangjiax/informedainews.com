Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have discovered that spiral galaxies were more common in the early universe than previously anticipated. This finding challenges the traditional notions about the speed of galaxy formation.

A research team from the University of Missouri found that spiral galaxies were already prevalent 20 billion years after the universe's formation. Previously, scientists believed that such galaxies mainly appeared 6 to 7 billion years after the universe's formation.

Images captured by JWST show that nearly 30% of galaxies in the early universe had spiral structures. This data updates the observations made by the Hubble Space Telescope.

Vicki Koon, the lead researcher, noted that understanding the timing of spiral galaxy formation is crucial for comprehending the evolution of the universe. The new findings help better align the physical properties of galaxies with theoretical models.

Associate Professor Guo Yicheng emphasized that advanced instruments like JWST allow us to study distant galaxies in greater detail. Although the universe still holds many mysteries, these data provide more clues and deepen our understanding of cosmological physics.
