Incheon, South Korea, is now a hotspot for entertainment, thanks to the Mohegan Inspire Entertainment Resort. This new complex, a $1.44 billion venture, is a short drive from Incheon International Airport and an hour from Seoul. It's run by U.S.-based Mohegan, known for its Mohegan Sun casino in Connecticut.

The resort spans 460,000 square meters and includes a 150-meter arcade, a giant LED screen with immersive shows, and a variety of attractions. These range from a five-star hotel and a massive banquet hall to a sports arena and a dome-enclosed pool. There's also a children's play area and a shopping mall.

Inspire caters to all kinds of visitors, from foreign VIPs looking to gamble to younger crowds interested in K-pop and dining. Options are diverse, from high-end restaurants to a budget-friendly food court.

Nearby, Paradise City, another integrated resort, focuses on art and entertainment. It's a joint venture between Japanese group Sega Sammy Holdings and South Korean company Paradise. Despite challenges during the pandemic, both resorts are thriving, with plans for further expansion.

Casinos in South Korea, mainly targeting foreign visitors, have seen a resurgence, especially with more locals opting for staycations.
