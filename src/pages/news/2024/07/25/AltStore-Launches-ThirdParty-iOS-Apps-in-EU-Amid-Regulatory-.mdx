AltStore, an alternative app store, has launched third-party iOS apps in the EU, following the implementation of the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which forces Apple to open its platform to competitors. The initial offerings include iTorrent for P2P file downloads, qBitControl for torrent management, PeopleDrop for local social networking, and UTM SE, an emulator also available on the official App Store. AltStore independently verifies the safety of these apps. Users can add them through the “Sources” screen, located under “Browse.” The DMA's influence is evident: a more competitive app ecosystem is emerging, challenging Apple's dominance.
