Morpheus.Network, founded in 2017 in Toronto, leverages blockchain technology to streamline global supply chains. Co-founder Dan Weinberger, with 25 years of experience in logistics, witnessed firsthand the inefficiencies—compliance issues, documentation errors—and envisioned a solution.

The concept originated on a napkin and evolved into a blockchain platform that ensures data transparency and trust. Smart contracts automate workflows, from customs to delivery, preventing delays and fines.

A notable project includes digitizing Mongolia's certificate of origin process. Such initiatives with governments and the UN highlight their impact.

Morpheus.Network integrates with existing IT systems, avoiding costly overhauls. Their middleware supports various ERPs and TMS, enhancing backend automation without disruption.

Currently, they are targeting SMEs with Speed.supply, a self-managed platform for documentation and IoT integration. Weinberger predicts that blockchain, AI, and machine learning will further revolutionize supply chains, making efficiency a $2 trillion opportunity.
