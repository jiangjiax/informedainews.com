NextEra Energy CEO John Ketchum forecasts that demand for renewable energy will triple within seven years, fueled by the expansion of data centers for AI. The company has added 3,000 megawatts of renewable energy and storage capacity in the second quarter, with 28% attributable to agreements with Google. NextEra's portfolio of renewable energy assets currently stands at seven gigawatts in operation and in the backlog.

Electricity demand is on the rise, anticipated to grow at a rate four times faster than it has over the past 20 years. Data centers and electric vehicles are projected to increase energy consumption by 290 terawatt hours by 2030, a figure comparable to Turkey's total power demand. Utility companies must adapt to this growth to prevent economic disruptions.

Renewable energy sources are proving to be more cost-effective and quicker to deploy compared to natural gas, despite the latter's current role as a transitional fuel. NextEra is considering the reactivation of the Duane Arnold nuclear plant in Iowa, subject to a comprehensive risk assessment.

NextEra's stock performance is positive, with 70% of Wall Street analysts recommending it as a buy. The average price target indicates potential for nearly a 10% increase.
