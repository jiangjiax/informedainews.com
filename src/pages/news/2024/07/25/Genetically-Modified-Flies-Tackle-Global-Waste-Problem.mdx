Australian scientists are modifying the genes of black soldier flies to consume more waste. These flies already feed on organic garbage, converting it into materials we useâ€”such as lubricants and animal feed. The objective? To reduce methane emissions from landfills, a significant climate issue.

Dr. Kate Tepper and Dr. Maciej Maselko, from Sydney's Macquarie University, are leading the project. They view insects as the next major solution for our waste, which amounts to a staggering billion tons of food refuse annually. These flies, found worldwide except in Antarctica, can eat twice their body weight daily.

The team's spin-off, EntoZyme, aims to commercialize this technology, with plans to release genetically engineered flies by the end of the year. These flies could also produce enzymes for various industries and manage contaminated waste, transforming it into usable fertilizer.

In essence, these flies could serve as our new cleanup team, converting waste into valuable resources while aiding the planet.
