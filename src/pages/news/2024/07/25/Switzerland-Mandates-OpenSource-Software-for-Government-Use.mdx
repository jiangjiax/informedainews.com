Switzerland has recently enacted a law mandating that all government offices must utilize open-source software. This implies that the source code for the software they employ is publicly accessible, enhancing transparency and security. Additionally, they are required to distribute any new software they develop, unless it is copyrighted or sharing it poses significant risks. This initiative reduces reliance on proprietary software companies and fosters greater collaboration. It marks a pioneering step for any nation and could potentially encourage other countries to follow suit.

Open-source software refers to software whose source code is available for free, allowing anyone to use, modify, or enhance it.
