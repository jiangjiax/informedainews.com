NBA selects Amazon over Warner Bros. Discovery for media rights. Warner Bros. attempted to match Amazon's $1.8 billion per year offer, but the NBA states there is no legal right to do so. The Amazon deal is part of a $77 billion, 11-year contract with ESPN and NBCUniversal.

Warner Bros. claims it has matching rights from the current deal, which expires next season. The NBA argues that these rights do not cover all-streaming packages like Amazon's. Warner Bros. may consider suing.

Amazon Prime Video boasts over 200 million global customers, compared to Max's 100 million. The NBA seeks maximum reach.

Disney pays $2.62 billion, and NBCUniversal $2.45 billion per year. The new deal commences in 2025-26 and runs until 2035-36. The NBA app will direct fans to games on various platforms.

Disney will air 80 regular-season games, including on ABC and ESPN. NBCUniversal will broadcast 75 games on TV, up from 15. The NBA aims to maximize fan access and experience.
