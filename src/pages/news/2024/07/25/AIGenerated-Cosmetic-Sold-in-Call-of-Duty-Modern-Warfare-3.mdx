Activision has sold an AI-made cosmetic for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. AI-generated means it was created by artificial intelligence. A cosmetic is a non-essential item, such as a skin or emblem, that alters the appearance of a game character without impacting gameplay.

This move marks a new frontier in game design, merging human creativity with machine efficiency. It's a bold step, gauging consumer acceptance of AI-crafted content in a market traditionally dominated by human-made items.
