Europe is increasingly concerned about the potential impact of tensions in the Taiwan Strait. With Taiwan being a major trading partner and a key player in semiconductor manufacturing, a conflict could have significant global economic repercussions. European leaders are discreetly preparing for various scenarios, including economic sanctions and military responses, to avoid being caught off guard. Despite maintaining unofficial relations with Taiwan due to diplomatic constraints with China, European countries are quietly enhancing cooperation in areas like lawfare and cybersecurity. The EU must prioritize Taiwan and develop a multi-layered approach to address potential conflicts in the region.
