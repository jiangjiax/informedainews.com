CFIUS, a U.S. committee since 1975, scrutinizes foreign investments for national security risks. In 2023, it levied more penalties than in its prior 50 years combined. The surge follows new enforcement guidelines and higher fines, signaling a tougher stance. Notably, China led in review applications, reflecting heightened U.S. scrutiny of Chinese investments. This trend underscores a shift towards viewing investment through a geopolitical lens, potentially impeding global economic cooperation.
