Dentists often struggle with accurate diagnoses. Some overtreat, others underdiagnose. AI offers a solution. Pearl, an AI startup, just raised $58 million to help dentists with X-ray analysis.

Pearl uses computer vision to spot dental issues. It's FDA-cleared and claims to boost treatment acceptance by 30%. The software highlights problem areas, but dentists make the final call.

Ophir Tanz, Pearl's CEO, sees AI as the future of dental care. He predicts global adoption within three years. Competitors like Video Health and Overject are also making strides.

AI in dentistry standardizes X-ray interpretation. With a vast dataset of dental images, AI models are robust. Pearl's success shows the potential of AI in healthcare. It's not about replacing dentists, but enhancing their capabilities.
