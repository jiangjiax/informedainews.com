Yakult, the probiotic drink manufacturer, aims for a 50% increase in sales in India. They have introduced a mango-flavored version exclusively for the country. Eiji Amano, Managing Director of Yakult Danone India, announced this at a recent event.

The company, a joint venture between Yakult Honsha and Groupe Danone, has been operating in India since 2008 and now serves 650 cities. Initially offering the original flavor, they launched "Yakult Light" in 2018 to address sugar concerns, which now accounts for 25% of their sales.

The new mango flavor, part of the light series, targets a 10-15% market share. Priced at 100 rupees for a pack of five, there are also discounts available for home delivery. Currently, around 300 Yakult ladies, who are delivery workers, serve Delhi, Mumbai, and Pune.

Amano highlighted customer-centric product development. The event was attended by Takashi Ariyoshi, Minister at the Japanese Embassy, and Bollywood actress Sanya Malhotra. Ariyoshi commended Yakult's unique distribution system and its community impact in Japan.
