Tom Daley, diver, and Helen Glover, rower, will carry the Great Britain flag at the Paris 2024 Olympics opening ceremony. Both are returning from retirement. Daley, 30, seeks his fifth Olympics, after gold in Tokyo 2020. Glover, 38, aims for her third Olympic title.

The ceremony will be historic, not held in a stadium but on the River Seine. Athletes will travel six kilometers by boat through Paris, starting at Austerlitz bridge and ending near the Eiffel Tower.

Daley and Glover share a bond through parenthood and sport. Daley's son Robbie and Glover's three children influenced their comebacks. Both express deep honor in being flagbearers.

This role was shared by Hannah Mills and Mohamed Sbihi in Tokyo, marking the first time nations could select both male and female flagbearers.
