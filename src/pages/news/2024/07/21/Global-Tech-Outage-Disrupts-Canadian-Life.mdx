A global tech outage hit hard today. CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm, blamed a software update for crashing Microsoft Windows systems worldwide. The glitch caused a blue screen of death, halting operations in airlines, government agencies, hospitals, and media outlets like CBC.

Porter Airlines canceled all flights. U.S. airlines faced similar issues. Borders saw delays as systems failed. The Canadian government warned of delayed Child Benefit payments. CrowdStrike's CEO apologized and promised to restore all services.

Health services in British Columbia, Toronto, and Hamilton faced disruptions but managed to keep operations running. The outage also affected health-care services in Newfoundland and Labrador.

Airports advised travelers to check flight statuses. Pearson International reported varying impacts by airline. Major U.S. carriers like Delta and American faced significant problems. Globally, over 2,600 flights were canceled.

Border crossings between Canada and the U.S. experienced snags and delays. The outage highlighted the vulnerability of relying heavily on a few tech companies. Cybersecurity experts call for stronger government regulation to prevent such widespread disruptions.
