Miho Fujita, president of Mioya Shuzo, faced a 7.6-magnitude earthquake in Ishikawa, Japan, on January 1, 2024. The quake shattered many bottles at her sake brewery. Despite initial fears, most bottles survived, and production resumed quickly due to access to well water.

Fujita, a pioneer in the male-dominated sake industry, left a successful marketing career at Mattel to take over her father's struggling brewery in 2003. Her transition was challenging, but she learned every aspect of sake making.

Toshiaki Yokomichi, her master brewer, also switched careers midlife, bringing expertise from Osaka's Daimon Shuzo. Together, they rebuilt Mioya Shuzo, now a successful brand in Japan and abroad.
