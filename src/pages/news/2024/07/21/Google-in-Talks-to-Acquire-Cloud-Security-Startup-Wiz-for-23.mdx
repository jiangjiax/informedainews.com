Google is in talks to buy Wiz, a cloud security startup, for $230 billion. If successful, this would be Google's largest acquisition ever. Wiz, founded in 2020, is renowned for its rapid growth and innovative cloud security solutions, collaborating with major cloud providers such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.

The founders of Wiz previously sold another security company, Adallom, to Microsoft for $3.2 billion. They then worked at Microsoft, enhancing its cloud security before founding Wiz. Wiz has quickly attracted clients like Oracle, BMW, and Salesforce, and holds a record of reaching $1 billion in annual recurring revenue within 18 months.

Google's interest in Wiz is strategic. Wiz specializes in securing cloud environments and AI applications, key areas where Google aims to enhance its cloud business. Google's cloud revenue is increasing but still trails behind Amazon and Microsoft. Acquiring Wiz could enhance Google's cloud security reputation and competitiveness.

Google has been active in the cybersecurity market, acquiring other security firms like Siemplify and Mandiant. These acquisitions aim to strengthen Google's cloud security offerings and capitalize on the rising demand for secure cloud and AI solutions.
