Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) is doubling down on remakes and new programming. They're adapting to shifts in how people consume entertainment, including ad-supported shows and in-car streaming.

In May, SPE hosted LA Screenings in Hollywood. Over 200 streaming platforms and broadcasters attended. A highlight was the remake of the Italian medical drama "Doc," produced with Fox.

SPE's TV production revenue has surged by 50% in five years. Movie distribution, however, remains weak post-pandemic. SPE aims to maximize IP value through licensing and remakes.

"S.W.A.T.," a police drama, became a hit on Netflix after airing on CBS. A new season is in development. Keith Le Goy, SPE's chairman, notes that traditional broadcast-style shows are thriving on streaming platforms.

SPE is also exploring new streaming formats. They launched Ridevu, an in-car streaming service for VinFast and Mercedes-Benz. Additionally, they're expanding into Free Ad-Supported Streaming Television (FAST), which is growing globally.

SPE launched Spanish-language and European channels for FAST platforms. Tony Vinciquerra, SPE's CEO, emphasizes they are a content supplier, not a streaming service.

**FAST**: Free Ad-Supported Streaming Television. Similar to traditional TV but free online, funded by ads.
