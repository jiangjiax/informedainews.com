Hikari No Akari, a major piracy site for anime music, has shut down. The site, active since 2014, offered over 28,000 titles, including albums, movies, TV dramas, and video games. It drew 15 million visits in the past year, mostly from outside Japan.

The Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) pursued legal action in the U.S., obtaining subpoenas to uncover the site's operator. Cloudflare, the California-based network provider, complied, leading to the site's closure.

Piracy of Japanese music caused between $142 million to $586 million in losses in 2022. Despite subscription services' growth, piracy sites continue to attract users by promoting high-quality, free content.

The RIAJ aims to hold the operator accountable and warns users of the legal risks associated with piracy. Japan's 2020 copyright law revisions target such leech sites, making unauthorized downloading illegal.
