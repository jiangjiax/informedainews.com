Gordon Brown and Sadiq Khan launch London's first multibank, Felix's Multibank, to combat rising child poverty. This initiative, part of a network expanding across Britain, distributes essential goods like food, baby products, and toiletries. The multibank model, pioneered in Fife, Scotland, aims to redistribute surplus stock and corporate donations to those in need, particularly during school holidays when free meals are unavailable.

Amazon plays a significant role, contributing supplies and logistics support. Public funding aids operational costs. Teachers express deep concern over children facing hunger due to parental financial struggles. The multibank system, while praised for its impact, raises questions about the long-term reliance on such measures due to welfare state cuts.

Sadiq Khan highlights the necessity of these efforts in the face of the cost of living crisis. John Boumphrey of Amazon emphasizes collaborative impact with local charities and community groups. The multibank initiative reflects a broader societal shift towards addressing destitution more directly and sustainably.
