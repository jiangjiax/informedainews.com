China's push for clean energy is massive. They are adding renewables at a rate equivalent to constructing five large nuclear plants weekly. A Sydney-based think tank, CEF, predicts they will reach their 2030 target six years early.

China is installing 10 gigawatts of wind and solar power every two weeks, a significant achievement. With China accounting for a third of the world's total emissions, these levels might have already peaked. Their power grid is transitioning to green energy, thanks to extensive solar and wind farms in the west, connected to the east via long transmission lines.

Interestingly, China continues to build coal plants. Last year, they accounted for 95% of the world's new coal plant construction. These plants serve to balance the grid, supporting the intermittent nature of wind and solar power.

However, the role of coal in China's power mix is diminishing. Renewables could surpass coal this year. While China added only 1 gigawatt of nuclear power last year, compared to 300 gigawatts of solar and wind, they are lagging in nuclear but leading in renewables.

Despite soaring electricity demand, renewables will meet this growth. Coal power will gradually decline as renewables and nuclear power expand. The EU leads in reducing CO2 intensity from power generation, with China closely following.
