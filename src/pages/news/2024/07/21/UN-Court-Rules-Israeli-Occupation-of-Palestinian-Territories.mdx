The UN's top court declares Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories illegal. The ICJ, based in The Hague, states that settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem are unlawful. Israel must end the occupation and remove settlers. Prime Minister Netanyahu calls the decision "a lie."

The ICJ's opinion, though not binding, carries significant political weight. This is the first time the court has addressed the 57-year occupation. Israel disputes the legality of the settlements. The court finds that Israel's control over Gaza persists despite the 2005 withdrawal.

Israel has built 160 settlements since 1967, housing 700,000 Jews. The ICJ labels these annexations as against international law. The court also criticizes Israel's exploitation of Palestinian resources and systemic discrimination.

Palestinians welcome the ICJ's ruling. PLO's Hussein Al Sheikh calls it a "historic victory." The decision now goes to the UN General Assembly, which may adopt a resolution, potentially catalyzing negotiations.

This ruling is separate from South Africa's ongoing case at the ICJ, accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza.
