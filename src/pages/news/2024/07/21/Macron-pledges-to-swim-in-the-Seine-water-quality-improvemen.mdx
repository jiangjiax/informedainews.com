French President Emmanuel Macron has pledged to swim in the Seine River, though the date remains undetermined. He emphasized that this move is not only for the Olympics but also for the future of Paris residents being able to swim in the Seine. Since the 1923 ban on swimming, the government has invested 1.4 billion euros to improve water quality, including the construction of new reservoirs. The latest water quality report shows that the Seine now meets the standards for open water competitions. The Sports Minister has personally tested the water to alleviate public concerns.
