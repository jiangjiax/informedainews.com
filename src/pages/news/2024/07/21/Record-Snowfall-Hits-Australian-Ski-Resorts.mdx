Australian ski resorts are buried in snow. Falls Creek received 45cm in 24 hours. Mt Buller and Mt Stirling are thrilled. David Clark, their marketing manager, says the snow "just keeps coming."

Resorts like Mount Hotham and Thredbo are full, with more snow on the way. Experts predict another 50cm over the next 10 days. Perisher saw 25cm overnight, with 80cm more expected.

Sarah Watt at Falls Creek urges pre-booking due to high demand. The cold front brings record lows and blizzard conditions across the southeast. Angus Hines from the Bureau of Meteorology calls it a "very wintry outbreak."

Wind warnings stretch across Australia, with Sydney under a severe weather alert. Mt Buller experienced gusts up to 100km/h. Queensland saw record lows, with Winton at -0.6 degrees, a 22-year record.

Clark enjoys watching kids ski in "super thick fresh powder snow" at Mt Buller's magic forest. The resort plans to open three more lifts. The season is off to a snowy start.
