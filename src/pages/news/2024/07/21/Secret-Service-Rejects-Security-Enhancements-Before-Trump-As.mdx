The US Secret Service had denied requests to enhance Donald Trump's security for two years before an assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump was shot in the ear and briefly hospitalized. The assailant, Thomas Crooks, 20, killed one person and injured two before being subdued by the Secret Service. The FBI is investigating the incident as a potential case of domestic terrorism.
