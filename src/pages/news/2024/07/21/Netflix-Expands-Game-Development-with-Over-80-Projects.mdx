Netflix is diving deep into the gaming industry, developing over 80 titles with the goal of releasing a new game every month. Greg Peters, a high-ranking executive at Netflix, emphasizes that the focus is on profitability. The global gaming market, excluding China and Russia, is a massive $150 billion industry.

Netflix's games avoid typical microtransactions and advertisements. However, Peters hints at the possibility of ad-supported games in the future. They have been involved in gaming for about three years and are pleased with their progress.

Currently, games represent a small part of Netflix's strategy. Yet, they are committed to long-term growth, anticipating that it will accelerate. Peters discusses aligning investments with business impact, cautious expansion, and enhancing user engagement.

To date, they have launched over 100 games and gained valuable insights. They are doubling down on successful strategies, particularly interactive narrative games, which are relatively easy to produce.

Fans are enjoying games based on popular Netflix shows like "Virgin River" and "Love is Blind." New properties like "Emily in Paris" and "Selling Sunset" are also in the pipeline. Ted Sarandos, another Netflix executive, is excited about games bridging gaps between seasons and potentially integrating game narratives into future series.

Upcoming significant projects include a multiplayer game for "Squid Game" and a major title led by Joseph Staten, a prominent figure in the gaming industry. Netflix's gaming portfolio already includes "GTA: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition."

In summary, Netflix is heavily investing in games to increase engagement and revenue. They are proceeding cautiously but steadily, learning and adapting along the way.
