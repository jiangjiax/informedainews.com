Shamsa Sharawe, a Somali FGM survivor, chose reconstructive surgery to regain her clitoris. FGM, or female genital mutilation, involves cutting off parts of a girl's genitalia. In Shamsa's case, this happened when she was six. She used a rose to show the damage in a viral TikTok video.

FGM is a deep-rooted practice in Somali culture, believed to preserve virginity. Those who avoid it face stigma, seen as promiscuous. Shamsa, now 31, moved to the UK in 2001. She faced forced marriage and rape in Somalia at 18.

Reconstructive surgery isn't covered by the UK's NHS. Shamsa learned about it from Haja Bilkisu, another FGM survivor. She raised £25,000 online for the procedure in Germany. The surgery, done by Dr. Dan mon O’Dey, used tissue from her buttocks to rebuild her clitoris and labia.

Shamsa's journey highlights the ongoing struggle against FGM. Her story offers hope and options to others. Despite the physical and financial toll, she feels a sense of completeness and empowerment.
