The news of the seventh global patient cured of HIV has sparked heated discussions. A 60-year-old German man, who underwent a stem cell transplant in 2015, has remained asymptomatic and has tested negative for the virus since. Prior to this, there have been six similar cases of cure.

The key lies in the transplanted stem cells containing a CCR5 gene mutation, which provides resistance to HIV. CCR5 is the main receptor through which the virus enters cells; with the mutation, the virus cannot enter cells, thereby blocking infection and replication.

However, not all transplants are successful, and there are issues with individual differences and scarce donors. Experts believe that a functional cure, where the viral load is so low that it cannot be detected, is a more promising goal.

In the future, research will focus on immunotherapy and gene therapy, such as CAR-T cell therapy, which has shown potential in clinical trials.

HIV remains a significant global public health challenge, and prevention remains the best method of control.
