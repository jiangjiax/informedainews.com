US plans to station missiles in Germany worry Russia. Moscow vows to respond, eyeing new missile placements in Kaliningrad, Belarus, and the Far East. This could target Alaska and parts of the US.

Swedish observer Mikael Valtersson suggests Russia might also deploy missiles near US allies in North Africa or the Caribbean. He warns of increased tensions and the risk of hasty decisions due to shorter missile flight times.

The situation echoes the 1980s Euromissiles crisis, sparking protests and near-accidental nuclear war. Germany's defense minister dismisses comparisons, but tensions remain high.

Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister, Sergei Ryabkov, promises necessary measures. The US exited the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 2019, allowing these deployments.

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists recently adjusted the Doomsday Clock closer to midnight, highlighting global nuclear tension.
