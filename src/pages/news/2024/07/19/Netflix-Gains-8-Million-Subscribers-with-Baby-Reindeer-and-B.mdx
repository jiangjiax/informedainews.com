Netflix added 8 million subscribers last quarter, reaching a total of 277.7 million. Revenue surged by 17% to $9.5 billion, driven by paid memberships and ad-supported subscriptions.

Popular shows like Baby Reindeer and Bridgerton attracted significant viewership, particularly in the UK and India. Baby Reindeer garnered 88.4 million viewers.

The company introduced cheaper ad-supported plans and tightened restrictions on password sharing, leading to a surge in subscribers.

Netflix is expanding its offerings by partnering with the NFL and WWE for live sports and wrestling events. It is also branching into live events featuring personalities such as Joe Rogan and Mike Tyson.

The streaming giant is now prioritizing viewing hours over subscriber counts, focusing on measuring success through member engagement. It competes directly with YouTube, claiming nearly half of U.S. streaming TV watch time.
