China plans to launch the Long March 10 rocket by 2027, aiming for a manned lunar landing before 2030. The rocket has a payload capacity of 70 tons and a lunar transfer orbit capability of 27 tons. The manned lunar landing plan involves using two rockets to separately transport the lunar lander and the manned spacecraft to the lunar transfer orbit, where they will rendezvous and dock in lunar orbit. Astronauts will then land on the moon for exploration and sample collection before returning to Earth.

**Explanation:**
- **Lunar Transfer Orbit**: The flight path from Earth to the Moon.
- **Lunar Orbit**: The orbit around the Moon.
- **Rendezvous and Docking**: The connection of two spacecraft in space.
