A drug targeting interleukin-11, a protein that increases with age, extended mouse lifespans by 25%. Mice treated with the drug experienced fewer cancers, enhanced muscle function, and appeared younger. The treatment is currently undergoing human trials.

Interleukin-11 is known to contribute to inflammation and aging. By eliminating it, researchers not only improved the overall health of mice but also extended their lifespans. The promising results in mice have sparked optimism for comparable benefits in humans.
