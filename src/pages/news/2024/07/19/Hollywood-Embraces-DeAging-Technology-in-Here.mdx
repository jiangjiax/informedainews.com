Hollywood's love for de-aging technology is growing. Scorsese used it with De Niro in The Irishman, and Ford in Indiana Jones also employed it. Now, Zemeckis is tackling Tom Hanks and Robin Wright in Here.

Zemeckis, known for Back to the Future and Forrest Gump, utilizes AI from Metaphysic Live. This technology creates younger versions of Hanks and Wright, seamlessly and in real-time.

The trailer for Here shows Hanks looking youthful, reminiscent of his Big days. The film, set in a single house with a fixed camera, spans the characters' lives.

De-aging technology often falls into the "uncanny valley," appearing not quite human. Zemeckis aims to avoid this by meticulously blending technology with traditional makeup.

The AI models Hanks and Wright using decades of footage, overlaying younger versions onto the current actors based on their expressions. The result is a mirror through time.

Zemeckis is optimistic, believing the technology enhances storytelling by showing what is unseen in real life. If successful, Here could change how Hollywood uses de-aging technology.
