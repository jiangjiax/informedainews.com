Xiaohongshu, known as the "little red book," began in 2013 as an app for shopping tips. Today, it has evolved into a lifestyle guide with over 300 million users, predominantly young women. Users depend on it for daily advice ranging from dining to travel.

The app's core strength is its community and sophisticated algorithm. It curates content tailored to individual interests, often impressing users with its accuracy. This personalization aids lesser-known brands in gaining visibility through targeted marketing.

Xiaohongshu's algorithm also promotes content from less prominent users, striving for a balanced community. More users are increasingly relying on its search function, with 70% conducting searches monthly.

Unlike Douyin, which has a global version (TikTok), Xiaohongshu remains unified, appealing to the global Chinese community. Its user base is primarily Chinese, though international usage is on the rise.

The app's success is rooted in its community-driven approach and advanced algorithm, making it an essential daily tool for many.
