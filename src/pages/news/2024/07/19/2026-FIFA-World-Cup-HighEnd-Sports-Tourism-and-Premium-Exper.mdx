The 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will span the United States, Canada, and Mexico, aims to be the grandest sports spectacle yet. On Location, a hospitality giant, will manage exclusive packages, promising stadium suites, hospitality villages, and unique local experiences.

On Location, launched by the NFL in 2015, now handles premium experiences for major events like the Olympics and various sports leagues. Their recent $1.3 billion deal with the IOC underscores their reach and influence in the sports tourism sector.

For the World Cup, they expect to sell around one million premium tickets, focusing on curated local food and entertainment. MLS, with its deep soccer roots and stadium insights, will assist in promoting these packages.

FIFA anticipates a significant revenue boost from this event, aiming to surpass previous records. The market buzz is palpable, with fans eager for unique, high-end experiences. The stage is set for a monumental event, blending sports, tourism, and local culture.
