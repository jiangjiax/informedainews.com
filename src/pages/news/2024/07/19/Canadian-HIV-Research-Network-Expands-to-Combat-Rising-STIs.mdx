Syphilis rates in Canada have doubled. HIV diagnoses jumped 25% from 2021 to 2022. Congenital syphilis, passed from mother to child, surged 599% from 2018 to 2022.

Dr. Marina Klein, from McGill University Health Centre, calls this an "explosion" of infections. The COVID-19 pandemic reduced testing and treatment. Other factors include immigration and access barriers like stigma and sparse health services.

The Pan-Canadian HIV/AIDS Clinical Trials Network, funded with $25 million, expands its focus to all sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections. They aim to find new treatments and preventions, especially for marginalized groups like Indigenous people in western Canada.

Klein emphasizes the need for long-acting therapies that reduce frequent visits to health professionals. The network will support researchers across Canada, leveraging its extensive experience in HIV/AIDS studies to conduct more and better trials.

Infections can emerge suddenly, like mpox. Klein warns against complacency, stressing the need for ongoing vigilance and research.
