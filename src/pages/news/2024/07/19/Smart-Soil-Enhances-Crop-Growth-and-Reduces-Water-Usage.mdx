Scientists at the University of Texas have developed "smart soil" using a specialized water gel. This gel absorbs water from the air at night and releases it to plants during the day, while also gradually providing nutrients such as calcium.

Tests revealed that plants grown in this soil achieved a 138% increase in height compared to normal, even with a 40% reduction in water usage. This innovation could significantly aid in feeding more people in arid regions. The researchers intend to conduct longer-term tests and incorporate additional fertilizers.
