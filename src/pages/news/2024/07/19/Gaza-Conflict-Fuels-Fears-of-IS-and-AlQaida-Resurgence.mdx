The Gaza conflict fuels fears of IS and al-Qaida resurgence. Security experts warn of increased extremism due to ongoing violence.

Israel's attacks on Gaza, particularly the Maghazi refugee camp, have left widespread devastation. This chaos is seen as fertile ground for extremist groups like Islamic State (IS) and al-Qaida to rebuild and recruit.

Recent months have seen heightened activity from IS branches in Sinai and Syria, and thwarted plots in Jordan. Turkey has also arrested dozens linked to an IS affiliate. Al-Qaida in Yemen (AQAP) is actively targeting Western and Israeli interests.

The conflict in Gaza is a major factor, but economic crises and civil unrest also contribute. The UN reports that extremist groups are exploiting the situation to attract new recruits and incite lone actors globally.

Television and internet coverage of Gaza's suffering intensifies radicalization. Analysts note a new wave of extremism driven by public disillusionment and poor socio-economic conditions.

IS and al-Qaida are leveraging the anger and despair to mobilize followers and plan attacks. The threat is real and growing, with potential impacts far beyond the Middle East.
