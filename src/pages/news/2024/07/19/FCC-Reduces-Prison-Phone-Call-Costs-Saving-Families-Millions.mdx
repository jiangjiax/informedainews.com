FCC slashes prison phone call rates. Interstate calls are halved, intrastate calls are capped. The cost of a 15-minute call drops from $11.35 to $0.90. The new rules take effect in January 2025. Families are expected to save $500 million annually. The regulations ban additional fees and prevent companies from directing callers to more expensive options.
