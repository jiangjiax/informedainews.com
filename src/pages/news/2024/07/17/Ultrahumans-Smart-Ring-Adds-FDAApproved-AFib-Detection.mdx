Ultrahuman's smart ring, the Ring Air, now detects AFibâ€”a heart rhythm issue. This feature costs $4.90 monthly. It uses a method called photoplethysmography (PPG), which measures heart rhythm by shining light on the skin and tracking blood volume changes. This method is FDA-approved.

The ring competes with smart watches, especially Apple's, which also detects AFib but uses ECG technology. Ultrahuman aims to expand its market by offering customizable features through "PowerPlugs," allowing third-party developers to create apps based on the ring's health data.

Currently, the AFib detection feature is available in several countries, including Australia and the EU, with plans to launch in the U.S. and India soon. Ultrahuman's CEO, Mohit Kumar, emphasizes the ring's accuracy and the company's cautious approach to avoid false positives and negatives.

The ring's core features remain subscription-free, differentiating it from competitors like Oura. Ultrahuman plans to keep most new "PowerPlugs" free, with only a few premium services requiring additional costs. Privacy is maintained by sharing only anonymized data with third-party developers.

Ultrahuman's strategy focuses on customization and innovation, aiming to make the smart ring a versatile health tool without the need for a subscription.
