Australian researchers have developed a vehicle-mounted system that uses cameras to detect if a driver is intoxicated. The system analyzes facial features such as gaze, eyelid, and chin status to predict blood alcohol concentration. Tests show that the system can identify low levels of intoxication in 75% of cases. Compared to traditional methods, this technology can immediately identify intoxication at the start of driving, preventing the vehicle from starting and thereby reducing drunk driving accidents.
