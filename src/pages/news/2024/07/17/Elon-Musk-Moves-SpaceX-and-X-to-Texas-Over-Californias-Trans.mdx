Elon Musk announced that SpaceX and X will move their headquarters from California to Texas. This decision follows California's new law preventing schools from notifying parents about a child's gender identity change. Musk criticized the law, calling it the "final straw" for his companies.

Musk's move reflects broader concerns about California's policies affecting families and businesses. His daughter's recent legal name and gender change, dropping the Musk surname, further underscores his stance.

Musk's endorsement of Trump and plans to fund a pro-Trump political action committee suggest alignment with potential rollback of transgender rights. Trump's proposals include halting Medicare and Medicaid funding for gender-affirming care and penalizing teachers for affirming students' gender identities.

Major medical organizations support access to necessary healthcare for transgender adolescents. Musk's relocation of Tesla's headquarters to Austin in 2021 signals a trend away from California's policies.
