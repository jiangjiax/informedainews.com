"Oishii Kyushoku 3," a Japanese film, explores the tradition of kyushoku, or school lunches. Set in the 1980s, it highlights a time when these meals were innovative, often featuring adapted Western dishes. The franchise, with three TV series and three films, contrasts the usual dark themes of Japanese school life with nostalgic, heartwarming scenes.

Kyushoku began in 1947, post-WWII, with American-supplied wheat bread and milk. It aimed to nourish starving Japanese children. By the 1960s, whole milk was standard, and today, options cater to various dietary needs. The typical tray includes milk, bread, a vegetable dish, and an entr√©e, all for about 255 yen ($1.58).

Whale meat, once a staple, faced controversy but has reappeared less frequently. Modern preferences lean towards pan-fried vegetables and fried chicken. The slice of white bread often gives way to a croissant, and a small dessert marks a privileged era.

Kyushoku's focus has never been solely on taste but on providing essential nutrients at a low cost. It has sustained generations, adapting yet retaining its core elements.
