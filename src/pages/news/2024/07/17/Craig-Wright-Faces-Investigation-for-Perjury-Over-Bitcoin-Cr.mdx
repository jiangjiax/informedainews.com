Judge Mellor of the UK High Court determined that Craig Wright lied and forged documents in his attempt to claim he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin. Consequently, Wright's public assertions and legal actions based on this claim are now prohibited. He is required to publish the court's findings on his website and social media platforms. The case has been forwarded to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for consideration of potential criminal charges and the issuance of an arrest warrant.
