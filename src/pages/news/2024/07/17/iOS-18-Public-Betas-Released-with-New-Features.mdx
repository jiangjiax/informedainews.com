Apple has released public betas of iOS 18. New features include a customizable Home Screen, a redesigned Photos app, enhanced Messages with emoji Tapbacks, and early access to Tap to Cash in Wallet. A notable missing feature is Apple Intelligence, an AI integration, which will be introduced later. Users can revert to older OS versions except on Apple Watch. Exciting additions like head nod commands for Siri with AirPods Pro 2 are also included.
