Multiple concussions in rugby players have been linked to higher levels of proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Concussions, which are common in rugby, can result in repeated head trauma. This study indicates that these injuries lead to an increase in certain proteins in the blood, proteins that are often found in elevated amounts in individuals with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.

The findings suggest a potential risk for long-term brain health in rugby players, emphasizing the need for improved concussion management and prevention strategies in sports. Neurodegenerative diseases are conditions that gradually damage the brain's nerve cells, causing memory loss, cognitive decline, and other neurological issues.
