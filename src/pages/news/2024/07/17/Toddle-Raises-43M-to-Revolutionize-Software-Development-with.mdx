Toddle, a Danish startup, aims to revolutionize software building with a no-code platform. Founded by Andreas MÃ¸ller and Kasper Svenning, Toddle offers a visual interface for designers and developers to collaborate in real-time. The platform mimics the capabilities of JavaScript frameworks like React, allowing users to create SaaS apps without coding.

Toddle's approach integrates design and development, enabling teams to work simultaneously on UI, content, and app logic. The platform supports external integrations for back-end functions like databases and authentication, avoiding a one-size-fits-all solution.

Pricing starts with a free tier for open-source projects, hosted on Toddle's domain. Paid options unlock additional features like custom domains and increased storage.

Recently, Toddle secured $4.3 million in seed funding, led by Inventure. The company plans to open-source its platform, allowing developers to self-host and modify the code. This move could significantly impact the accessibility and customization of software development tools.
