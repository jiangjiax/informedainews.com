Apple's stock rose 2% before the US market opened. Sales in the Indian market increased by 33%, reaching $79.6 billion. Morgan Stanley upgraded its rating with a target price of $273. The total market capitalization is $3.6 trillion.

Morgan Stanley estimates that Apple's iPad business revenue is $72 billion, a 23% year-over-year decrease. Citi expects the stock to rise another 30%, with potential for higher gross margins being underestimated.

Apple's market cap once surpassed $3 trillion but was also overtaken by Saudi Aramco. The fourth fiscal quarter revenue fell short of expectations, leading to a post-market decline in stock price.
