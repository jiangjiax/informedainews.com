55 years ago, NASA launched Apollo 11, marking the first manned moon landing. On July 16, 1969, at 9:32 AM, the mission blasted off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The crew, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins, spent eight days in space. Armstrong and Aldrin walked on the moon, while Collins orbited above.

The mission used a Saturn V rocket, a three-stage behemoth. After launch, the first two stages detached, and the third propelled the craft into Earth's orbit. Half an hour later, the lunar module separated, beginning its journey to the moon.

Armstrong, the mission commander, became the first man on the moon. Initially, there was debate within NASA about who would step onto the lunar surface first. Armstrong's role as commander sealed the decision.

Following Apollo 11, NASA conducted five more successful lunar missions. Apollo 13 faced a near disaster but recovered. The program concluded in 1972.

Today, NASA and Boeing are developing the Space Launch System (SLS), aiming to return humans to the moon. The SLS, along with the Orion spacecraft and SpaceX's Starship, represents the next chapter in lunar exploration. The SLS has already completed its maiden flight in 2022, demonstrating its capability.
