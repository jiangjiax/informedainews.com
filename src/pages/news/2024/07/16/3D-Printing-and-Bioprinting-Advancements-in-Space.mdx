UC Berkeley researchers, led by Taylor Waddell, sent a 3D printer, SpaceCAL, into space aboard Virgin Galactic's 07 mission. The printer utilized Computed Axial Lithography (CAL) to print four test parts in just 140 seconds of microgravity. CAL has the capability to print with over 60 materials, including biomaterials, which could potentially allow it to produce medical supplies such as dental replacements and skin grafts for astronauts. NASA plans to test bioprinting on the International Space Station, with the ultimate goal of printing human organs in space. This project received $1.4 million in funding from NASA and support from Virgin Galactic.
