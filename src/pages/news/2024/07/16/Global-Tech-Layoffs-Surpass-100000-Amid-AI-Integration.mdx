AI's rise is impacting global tech significantly. A total of 362 firms have cut 106,630 jobs. Intuit has fired 1800 employees and is shifting to AI-driven processes, replacing old staff with new hires who are proficient in AI. In the U.S., 20% of jobs are at risk from AI. OpenText and UiPath have also reduced their workforce. Major players like Microsoft, Apple, Meta, and ByteDance are following similar strategies.

AI is not just replacing jobs; it's altering the skills required. Companies are adapting, but the transition is harsh.
