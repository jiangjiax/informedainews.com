Scientists discovered a cave on the Moon. It is deep, possibly 100 meters, and an excellent location for a human base, offering protection from radiation and extreme temperatures.

The cave features a skylight, vertical walls, and a sloping floor, formed by lava long ago, similar to volcanic caves on Earth.

Researchers located it using radar and believe there are more such caves. They require additional technology, such as ground-penetrating radar, for comprehensive exploration.

This discovery aids in understanding the Moon's history, as the rocks inside the cave are less damaged, providing a clear geological record.

It may also assist in exploring Mars's caves, potentially revealing signs of life, if any existed.

The research has been published in Nature Astronomy.
