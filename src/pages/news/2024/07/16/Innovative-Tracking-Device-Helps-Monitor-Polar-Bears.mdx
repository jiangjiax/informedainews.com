Scientists have developed a new tracking device, the "hair-on-prickle" label, to monitor polar bears. This method is less invasive than traditional collars and can track subadults and adult male bears, groups previously hard to study.

The device sticks to the bear's fur and confirms that these bears spend most of their time on land, conserving energy until the ice returns. This technology fills a gap left by collars, which don't fit adult males or rapidly growing subadults.

The new trackers, tested on wild bears, showed promise. The SeaTrkr label, using GPS/Iridium technology, lasted an average of 58 days and provided more accurate data. This method could be crucial for understanding bear behavior and managing human-bear interactions.

This innovation, a result of collaboration between York University, 3M, and Polar Bears International, marks a significant step in wildlife management and conservation. It's especially vital as climate change accelerates, affecting bear habitats and interactions with humans.
