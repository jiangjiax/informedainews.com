The Insta360 Flow Pro gimbal is a compact, easy-to-use device that stabilizes videos with one hand. It folds for portability and features a USB-C port for charging. The top twists outward to turn on the device, and you mount your phone to start shooting.

Controls are centralized, allowing you to record, take photos, switch cameras, and more. The dial for switching modes mimics an iPod, which can be finicky but manageable. A wheel around the dial zooms in and out.

The gimbal includes a built-in selfie stick and tripod for various shots. It's a reliable stabilizer for smooth, stable videos and 360-degree panoramas.

The Insta360 app enhances functionality with DeepTrack 3.0, which tracks people and animals using AI. Additional effects like barrel rolls and TimeShift are available.

What sets the Flow Pro apart is its support for Apple DockKit. This allows the gimbal to track subjects in the stock Camera app and many third-party apps. Pairing is easy via NFC, and tracking works seamlessly across multiple apps.

At $149, the Insta360 Flow Pro offers a compelling mix of features and ease of use, making it a strong addition to any video kit.
