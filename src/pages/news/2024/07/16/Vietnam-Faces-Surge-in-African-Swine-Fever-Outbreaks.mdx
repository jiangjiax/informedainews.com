Vietnam is experiencing a surge in African swine fever outbreaks, with 660 cases reported this year compared to 208 last year. The number of culled pigs has increased fivefold. The disease poses a threat to food supplies and inflation. The government has directed its efforts towards vaccination, with two domestically produced vaccines currently in use. Rising pork prices are contributing to increased consumer costs.

African swine fever (ASF) is a deadly viral disease that affects pigs and had no cure or vaccine until recently. Vietnam's new vaccines represent a global first, but further testing is recommended.
