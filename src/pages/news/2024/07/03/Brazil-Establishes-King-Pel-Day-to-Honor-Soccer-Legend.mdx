Brazil sets "King Pelé Day" for Nov. 19, honoring the soccer legend's 1,000th goal in 1969. President Lula da Silva approved the law. Pelé, a three-time World Cup winner, passed away in 2022 at 82. The date commemorates his winning penalty kick for Santos against Vasco da Gama at Maracana Stadium. Some historians dispute the exact count of his goals. Pelé used the 1969 event to advocate for child welfare under Brazil's military dictatorship. Senator Jorge Kajuru, a former sports reporter, praised Pelé's global influence. Pelé's mother, Celeste Arantes, recently passed away at 101.
