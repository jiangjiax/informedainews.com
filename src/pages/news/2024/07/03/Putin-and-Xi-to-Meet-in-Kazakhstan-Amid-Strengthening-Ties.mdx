Putin and Xi will meet in Kazakhstan during a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit. Russia aims to strengthen ties with China, particularly in light of the Ukraine conflict with Europe and the US. Their previous discussion in May centered on enhancing economic and military cooperation. Putin recently visited North Korea, where he signed a military support treaty. Observers are keen to see how Russia will explain this to China, North Korea's primary supporter. The SCO members' opposition to the European-US framework is also under close examination.
