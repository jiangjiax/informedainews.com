South Africa fields a team of Rugby World Cup champions against Ireland in Pretoria. Twenty of the 23 players selected were part of the World Cup squad. Captain Siya Kolisi leads the charge, joined by Handre Pollard and others. The lineup boasts 966 caps, a formidable experience.

Rassie Erasmus, confident in the team's depth and World Cup winners' expertise, acknowledges Ireland's strength as the second-ranked team globally. The Springboks aim to break a losing streak against Ireland since 2016.

Ireland, having beaten South Africa at the World Cup and secured the Six Nations title, presents a tough challenge. The teams meet again in Durban next week.

South Africa's starting XV includes veterans like Willie le Roux and newcomers like Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu. The reserves feature RG Snyman and Marco van Staden.

Caps: A measure of a player's international appearances.
