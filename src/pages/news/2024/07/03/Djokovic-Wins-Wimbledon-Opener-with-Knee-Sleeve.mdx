Novak Djokovic won his first match at Wimbledon, wearing a knee sleeve. He had knee surgery a month ago. Djokovic beat Vit Kopriva easily, 6-1, 6-2, 6-2. He focused on quick points, avoiding long runs.

Djokovic, 37, has won seven Wimbledon titles before. He aims for an eighth, tying Roger Federer's record. He said he wouldn't risk this for any other tournament.

After the match, Djokovic thanked his surgeon. He also mentioned Andy Murray, who withdrew due to a spine procedure. Djokovic respects Murray's contributions to tennis and hopes he finishes on his terms.
