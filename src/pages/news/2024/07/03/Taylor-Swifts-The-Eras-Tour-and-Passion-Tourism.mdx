Taylor Swift's The Eras Tour is sparking a new kind of travel: passion tourism. Fans like Nikita Rao plan trips around her concerts, mixing city visits with shows. Rao's family, from Maryland, built a week in London and Amsterdam around Swift's performances.

Passion tourism isn't new. Events like Rio's Carnival and the 2024 Paris Olympics draw crowds. But Swift's appeal stands out. Travel agents note a surge in trips centered on her concerts, more than for any other artist.

This trend boosts local economies. Swift's UK tour alone could bring in $1.3 billion, with fans spending on tickets, travel, and lodging. Airbnb sees a 70% rise in bookings during her tour dates.

Swift's influence extends beyond typical tourist spots. Cities like Edinburgh, less frequented by Americans, see a surge in interest when she performs. Her concerts offer a blend of travel and fan experience, making her a unique driver of passion tourism.
