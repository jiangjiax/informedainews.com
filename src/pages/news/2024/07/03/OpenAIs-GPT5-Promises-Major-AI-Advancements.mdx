OpenAI's GPT-5, still in early stages, promises a significant leap in AI capabilities. CEO Sam Altman describes it as a "huge leap." GPT-4o, the current flagship, is praised for its "magic." GPT-5 is expected to reach doctoral-level intelligence by 2025 or 2026.

CriticGPT, released recently, evaluates and corrects GPT-4's outputs. OpenAI has also opened up new features to free users, including customizable GPTs. GPT-4o has boosted ChatGPT's subscription demand and mobile revenue.

OpenAI remains tight-lipped about GPT-5's exact release date, emphasizing its ongoing development.
