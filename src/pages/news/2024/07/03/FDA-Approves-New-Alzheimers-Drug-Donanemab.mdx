FDA approves donanemab, a new Alzheimer's drug. Developed by Eli Lilly, it targets amyloid beta, a protein linked to nerve cell damage in Alzheimer's patients. The drug binds and removes this protein, slowing disease progression. The approval reflects the FDA's dedication to effective Alzheimer's treatments. Eli Lilly also seeks approval in Japan.

Amyloid beta: a protein that accumulates abnormally in Alzheimer's brains, believed to harm nerve cells.
