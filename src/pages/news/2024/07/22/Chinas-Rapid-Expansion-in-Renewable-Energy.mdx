China's push for clean energy is massive. They are adding renewable sources at a rate equivalent to constructing five large nuclear plants every week. The Sydney-based think tank, CEF, predicts they will reach their 2030 target six years ahead of schedule.

China is installing 10 gigawatts of wind and solar power every two weeks, which is a significant amount. With China accounting for a third of the world's total emissions, these emissions might have already peaked. Their power grid is rapidly going green.

Large solar and wind farms in the west are connected to the east via massive transmission lines. They are also constructing coal plants to maintain stability, although coal's role is diminishing. Renewables could surpass coal in power generation this year.

China's focus is more on solar and wind than nuclear energy. Last year, they added 1 gigawatt of nuclear power but 300 gigawatts of solar and wind. Their nuclear plans are lagging, but their renewables are advancing.

Despite the construction of new coal plants, renewables are expected to meet all new electricity demand. Coal's future is a gradual decline. China's CO2 intensity is improving, though not as quickly as the EU, it is faster than the U.S.
