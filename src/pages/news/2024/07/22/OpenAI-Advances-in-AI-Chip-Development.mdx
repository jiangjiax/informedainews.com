OpenAI, fresh off the release of GPT-4o mini, is pushing ahead with a bold plan to develop its own AI chips. Led by Sam Altman, the initiative aims to reduce reliance on Nvidia, a leading chip manufacturer. Altman has recruited top talent from Google's TPU team, including Richard Ho, a seasoned engineer with a background from Manchester University and Stanford.

The project, slated for completion by 2027, involves potential collaboration with Broadcom, known for its work with Google on TPUs. This move could shift the balance of power in the AI chip market, where Nvidia currently dominates.

Altman's strategy also includes securing more chips from suppliers like TSMC, despite initial reluctance due to the high risk and cost. Additionally, he's exploring partnerships for new data centers, aiming to build a resilient supply chain.

The ultimate goal? Achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), a far more advanced form of AI capable of tasks like colonizing Mars or developing fusion energy. This vision underscores Altman's ambitious drive to revolutionize AI capabilities.
