Tadej Pogacar, 25, secured his third Tour de France title, achieving a historic Giro d’Italia-Tour de France double. No rider had accomplished this feat in the modern era. Pogacar dominated the final time trial in Nice, finishing 6:17 ahead of Jonas Vingegaard.

Throughout the race, Pogacar won six stages in both the Giro and the Tour, a first in the event's history. His performance invites comparisons to Eddy Merckx, widely regarded as cycling’s greatest champion. Merckx won five Tours; Pogacar now has three from five starts.

The landscape of the Tour has evolved. It has become globalized, technology-driven, and commercialized. Pogacar, hailing from Slovenia, epitomizes this new era. His success stands in stark contrast to Marco Pantani’s 1998 double, achieved during a doping-riddled period.

Mark Cavendish, 39, likely participated in his final Tour. He is expected to transition to a role with his sponsors.

Pogacar’s victory was not without controversy. Questions were raised about his team’s use of carbon monoxide rebreathing. Despite this, his dominance is unquestionable.

The race also showcased new talents. Eritrean Biniam Girmay won three stages and the green jersey. Richard Carapaz, from Ecuador, claimed the King of the Mountains title.

Critics argue that the ‘Netflixisation’ of the Tour undermines tradition. However, the sport continues to attract a new, tech-savvy audience, drawn to Pogacar’s relentless performance.
