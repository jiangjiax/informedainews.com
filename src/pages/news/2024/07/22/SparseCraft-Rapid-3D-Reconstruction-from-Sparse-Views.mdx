SparseCraft: A new method for 3D shape and appearance recovery from few images. Utilizes a neural network with a Signed Distance Function (SDF) and a radiance field. Trains through ray marching and volumetric rendering, guided by multi-view stereo cues. Emphasizes linearity in the SDF field to manage noise. Achieves top performance in view synthesis and reconstruction from sparse views, training in under 10 minutes.
