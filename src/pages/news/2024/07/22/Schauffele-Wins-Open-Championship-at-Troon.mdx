Xander Schauffele claimed the 152nd Open Championship at Royal Troon, fending off Justin Rose with a flawless 65 to conclude at nine under par. This victory marks his second major triumph in just three months, following his win at the US PGA Championship. Schauffele's achievement makes him the first golfer since Rory McIlroy in 2014 to win both The Open and the US PGA in the same year.

Rose, who shot a 67, finished two strokes adrift of Schauffele, tying for second place with Billy Horschel. Despite a robust performance, Rose was unable to clinch his second major title, his sole victory being the 2013 US Open.

Schauffele's victory also contributes to an American clean sweep of the majors this year, a feat not accomplished since 1982. His composed demeanor during the final stretch was particularly noteworthy, contrasting with his earlier performances at the PGA.

The final round was filled with suspense, featuring six players tied for second at the outset, the most in 30 years for a major championship. Schauffele's consistent play and Rose's aggressive beginning set the stage for an engaging contest. On the challenging back nine, Schauffele managed to hold onto his lead, securing his title as the Champion Golfer of the Year.
