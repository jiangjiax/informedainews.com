The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is advancing reforms, with a focus on optimizing the environment for foreign investment and protecting the rights and interests of foreign investors. Restrictions on foreign investment in manufacturing are being relaxed, and openness in sectors such as telecommunications and the internet is being expanded. Additionally, systems to facilitate the lives of overseas personnel are being improved to promote international industrial chain cooperation.

Moreover, policies support foreign investment participation in financial pilot projects, drive the internationalization of the Renminbi, and accelerate the construction of Shanghai as a financial hub. The capital market will strengthen regulation to ensure stable development. The research and application of digital Renminbi will also be steadily advanced.

Reforms in the housing system will accelerate, constructing a new model for real estate development.
