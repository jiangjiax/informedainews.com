Bobby Jain, a former top executive at Millennium, launched Jain Global, a hedge fund, raising $53 billion. This marks the largest initial fundraising since 2018.

Jain, raised in New York by Indian immigrant parents, started his career in finance after studying political science at Cornell. He entered the industry through O'Connor and Associates, then moved to Credit Suisse, where he rose to global asset management.

At Millennium, Jain improved risk controls and managed over 300 investment teams, doubling assets under management to $60 billion. Despite a challenging market, Jain Global attracted significant investment by offering lower fees and shorter lock-in periods compared to industry standards.

Jain Global employs a multi-strategy approach, using various investment tactics to navigate diverse market conditions. This strategy is currently popular on Wall Street, aiming for consistent returns regardless of market volatility.
