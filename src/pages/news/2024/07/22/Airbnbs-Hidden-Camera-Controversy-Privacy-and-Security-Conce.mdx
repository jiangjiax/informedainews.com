CNN investigated Airbnb's hidden camera issue. Over a decade, 35,000 complaints about spying devices surfaced. Airbnb downplays the scale, but police have seized countless invasive images.

Airbnb's response is slow and secretive. They don't alert authorities when cameras are found, even involving kids. Legal action against Airbnb is tough; their terms push disputes into private arbitration, away from public scrutiny. Confidentiality agreements further shield them.

Airbnb claims these incidents are rare and act swiftly when alerted. Yet, their approach seems more about managing public image than protecting guests. The tech advances, making tiny, invisible cameras easier to hide, complicating detection and trust.
