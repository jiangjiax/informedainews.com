Pengzhan Sun, an Assistant Professor at the University of Macau, focuses on the development of two-dimensional material membranes and fundamental issues in separation science. He has utilized graphene to seal graphite single crystal microcavities, enhancing the precision of gas transmembrane transmission measurements by eight to nine orders of magnitude. His findings revealed that hydrogen molecules can anomalously penetrate the graphene lattice, while helium atoms cannot. This discovery challenges the conventional understanding of graphene's chemical inertness and suggests its catalytic activity.

Sun further precisely fabricated single atomic vacancy channels on the surface of graphene, discovering that these channels exhibit exponential-level sieving capabilities for different gas molecules. These research outcomes provide scientific basis for the development of high-precision molecular detection, non-precious metal catalysts, and atom-scale porous two-dimensional separation membranes.

Sun's research not only deepens the understanding of material transport processes in atomic-scale confined spaces but also aims to transform fundamental scientific findings into practical technologies, serving environmental, energy, and chemical sectors. His work demonstrates the significant potential of two-dimensional materials in addressing common separation issues such as high energy consumption and low efficiency.
