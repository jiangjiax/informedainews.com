Global military spending reached $2.4 trillion last year. Startups and investors are now focusing on defense technology, particularly those with dual-use potentialâ€”technology that serves both civilian and military needs.

Helsing, a German AI startup, is a prime example of this trend. Its co-CEO, Gundbert Scherf, believes that AI is essential for democratic defense. The investment by Spotify founder Daniel Ek in Helsing indicates a societal shift towards resilience technology.

The NATO Innovation Fund (NIF) is a major player, investing $1 billion across various technology sectors to enhance defense and resilience. NIF supports startups in its 24 member countries and funds other venture capital firms like OTB Ventures, which specializes in deep technology.

MD One Ventures, based in the UK, specializes in dual-use technology for national security and defense. Its portfolio includes startups like Labrys Technologies and Materials Nexus.

The Israel Resilience Fund, launched after Hamas attacks, aims to raise $50 million for startups impacted by war. Its parent platform, OurCrowd, has secured $17 million so far.

D3, an early-stage fund, supports technology for Ukraine's defense. It invests in drones, sensors, and UAVs, often incorporating AI elements.

This surge in funding reflects a broader societal commitment to technology-driven resilience and defense.
