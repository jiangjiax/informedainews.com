CloudFlare, known as "赛博菩萨," now offers free AI-driven protection against content scraping bots. Previously, this required a paid subscription for advanced rules. Now, all users can activate this feature with a single click, blocking bots from unauthorized content scraping for AI training. The mechanism likely involves identifying known AI crawlers like OpenAI's GPTBot. This upgrade is crucial for sites, especially news outlets, guarding against unethical data harvesting. However, effective defense against undisclosed or rogue crawlers remains a challenge.
