Epic Games has submitted its store and an updated Fortnite app to Apple for notarization. This move follows the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which compels Apple to relax its restrictions on third-party developers. Apple maintains the authority to ensure that these applications meet its stringent security and privacy standards.

Epic, along with other companies such as Spotify, has been critical of Apple's strict requirements. The EU is currently investigating Apple's policies regarding alternative app stores and its Core Technology Fee (CTF). The CTF imposes a charge of 0.5 Euros per installation after the initial million, with no exemptions granted for free apps. Third-party app stores are also subject to this fee for every download, with no exceptions for the first million units.

Apple contends that the CTF is necessary to cover the expenses associated with utilizing its technology and notarization services, which are essential for validating apps for Apple platforms. Developers and owners of alternative app stores, such as Riley Testut's AltStore, have voiced their opposition to this fee to the EU.
