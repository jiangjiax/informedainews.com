Florida's ban on lab-grown meat takes effect next week. Upside Foods, a California company, hosted a Miami tasting event prior to the ban, serving cultivated chicken produced from animal cells in steel tanks. The process involves using water, sugar, fats, and vitamins to cultivate the cells into meat.

CEO Uma Valeti advocates for people's right to choose their food, arguing that cultivated meat is safe and could mitigate environmental harm caused by traditional meat production. Critics express concerns over safety and the potential impact on farmers.

Upside Foods adhered to FDA and USDA guidelines to secure approval and is challenging state bans as unconstitutional. The company's goal is to expand food options rather than replace traditional farming.
