"The Sims 4" welcomes a new expansion pack, "Heartfelt Havoc," which introduces free updates for polyamorous relationships. Previously, the series did not officially support such relationships. The update includes a "Love Boundaries" system that allows players to customize the exclusivity of relationships and jealousy reactions. Sims can date multiple people simultaneously without affecting other relationships. The player community has reacted enthusiastically, eagerly anticipating this long-awaited feature. Both console and PC players will benefit from the update, which will be released on July 25th along with the expansion pack.
