Scarfe, at the University of Reading, tested AI's impact on exams. His team used ChatGPT-4 to generate answers for psychology modules. 63 AI-made submissions slipped into the system, 94% undetected. Nearly 84% scored better than human students.

The AI excelled in intro-level courses but faltered in advanced modules. Detectors flagged AI submissions not for being robotic, but for being too good.

Scarfe argues universities should adapt. AI is here to stay, and students should learn to use it. The future of education might blend human and AI skills.
