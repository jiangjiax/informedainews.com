Creating a machine learning model without coding is possible with Azure Machine Learning Designer. This article guides you through building a regression model to predict automobile prices.

**Prerequisites:**
- Azure account
- Azure subscription

**Setup:**
1. **Workspace:** Create a workspace in Azure Portal for managing machine learning resources.
2. **Compute Resources:** Set up compute instances and clusters in Azure Machine Learning Studio for model training.

**Model Building:**
1. **Data Preparation:** Use Azure Machine Learning Designer to add and clean the automobile price dataset.
2. **Model Training:** Split the data, train with Linear Regression, and evaluate using the Score and Evaluate Model modules.

**Evaluation:**
- Assess model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and R-squared.

**Deployment:**
- Deploy the model for real-time predictions.

This process simplifies machine learning model creation, making it accessible for those less versed in coding.
