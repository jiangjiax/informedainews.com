US agents, under Trump, campaigned in Germany against Nord Stream 2, a gas pipeline from Russia. Testimonies in a German state parliament session revealed US secret service involvement, aiming to sway environmental groups.

Thomas Kr√ºger, a state parliament chairman, cited witnesses who faced direct approaches from US intelligence, all in the name of "US interests."

The pipeline, completed in 2021, faced hurdles including US sanctions and German certification halts due to political tensions. In 2022, explosions damaged the pipeline, prompting terrorism investigations in both Russia and Germany.

Nord Stream 2, despite its completion, remains a point of contention, entangled in geopolitical struggles and security concerns.
