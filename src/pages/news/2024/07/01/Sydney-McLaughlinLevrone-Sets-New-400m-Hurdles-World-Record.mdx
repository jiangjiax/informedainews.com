Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, 24, set a new world record in the 400-meter hurdles at the U.S. Olympic trials, clocking 50.65 seconds. This marks her fifth record-breaking run at Hayward Field, University of Oregon. McLaughlin-Levrone, already the defending Olympic champion, dominated the race, finishing 1.99 seconds ahead of Anna Cockrell and 2.12 ahead of Jasmine Jones.

The event, once tightly contested, now sees McLaughlin-Levrone far ahead, prompting discussions about the possibility of breaking the 50-second barrier. Her training under coach Bobby Kersee has been pivotal, notably adjusting her stride count between hurdles to 14. This change, implemented since 2021, has significantly enhanced her performance.

With the Olympic final set for August 8 in Paris, expectations are high for another record or even a sub-50-second run. Hurdling legend Edwin Moses suggests it's within reach, possibly requiring a few more races to achieve.
