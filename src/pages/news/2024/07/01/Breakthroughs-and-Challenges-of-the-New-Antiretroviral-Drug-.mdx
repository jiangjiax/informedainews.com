Gilead Sciences recently announced that its HIV drug lenacapavir, in phase III trials, demonstrated 100% efficacy among 2,134 cisgender women with no cases of infection. Lenacapavir is an injectable capsid inhibitor designed to impede the assembly of the virus's protein shell and has been approved in the United States for HIV treatment, requiring combination with other antiviral drugs.

The drug has shown excellent performance in preventing HIV infection, with Gilead's CEO calling it a new tool for HIV prevention. However, lenacapavir faces multiple challenges in ending HIV transmission: a large global population of HIV-infected individuals, high costs of preventive medications, and the virus's strong mutation capabilities.

Despite these challenges, lenacapavir's long-acting properties (requiring only two injections per year) bring hope to HIV patients, potentially alleviating the psychological burden of daily medication, improving mental health, and reducing HIV transmission.

Gilead has a long history in antiviral research, having previously launched a hepatitis C drug that increased cure rates to nearly 100% and contributed to a shrinking market size. The success of lenacapavir not only boosted Gilead's stock price but also added another achievement to its efforts in HIV prevention and treatment.

Overall, while lenacapavir brings new hope to HIV prevention and treatment, completely ending the HIV epidemic will require further research and efforts.
