Game companies are utilizing large language models to generate characters that not only have detailed backgrounds but can also interact with players in multiple ways. This technology enables non-player characters (NPCs) in games to engage in continuous, unscripted, and non-repetitive dialogues.

Neuroscientists and psychologists have long used games as tools to study human psychology. For instance, the game "Ocean Hero Quest" helps research the navigational abilities of early-stage Alzheimer's patients by observing players' navigation behaviors in a virtual ocean.

The advantage of using games for research lies in people's willingness to participate without requiring payment, allowing researchers to conduct large-scale studies with smaller budgets. Professor Spears has collected data from over 4 million people across 195 countries.

The integration of artificial intelligence allows researchers to create a rich, immersive world, aiding them in studying how the brain responds to various social environments and how humans interact with others. By observing interactions between players and AI characters, scientists can gain deeper insights into the nature of cooperation and competition.

Additionally, AI game characters can help us understand relationships with virtual companions, which are becoming increasingly common. Professor Spears finds the study of these relationships inherently fascinating.
