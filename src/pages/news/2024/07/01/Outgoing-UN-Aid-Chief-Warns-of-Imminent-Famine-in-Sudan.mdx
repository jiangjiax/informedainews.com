Sudan teeters on the brink of a famine "beyond imagination," warns Martin Griffiths, outgoing UN aid chief. Over 750,000 Sudanese face imminent starvation, with conditions poised to worsen.

Griffiths compares Sudan's plight to the historic Ethiopian famine, which claimed 1 million lives from 1983 to 1985. He notes Sudan's crisis lacks the global attention and funding that Ethiopia received. The 2024 Sudan humanitarian plan, seeking $2.7 billion, is less than 17% funded.

In Gaza, 495,000 face catastrophic conditions, though numbers have halved since March. Griffiths highlights the effectiveness of aid, yet warns improvements may be fleeting.

Sudan's civil war leaders, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, obstruct aid access. The Darfur region, central to the famine, is blocked from receiving aid via Chad. Diplomatic efforts to resolve this stalemate are ongoing but urgent.

Griffiths emphasizes the critical need for aid to avert the looming disaster. Time is short, and the world's response remains inadequate.
