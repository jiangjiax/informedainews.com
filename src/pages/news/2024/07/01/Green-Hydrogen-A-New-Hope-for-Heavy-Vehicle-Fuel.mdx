In Corpus Christi, Texas, a plant converts water into "green" hydrogen using renewable energy. This hydrogen is then chemically transformed into diesel for heavy vehicles. This development is significantâ€”it could revolutionize how planes, ships, trains, and trucks obtain their fuel.

Batteries are too heavy for aircraft and too bulky for ships. Long-haul trucks and certain rail lines face challenges with electrification. These vehicles account for about half of transportation emissions.

Infinium, the owner of the plant, produces hydrogen-based fuels aiming for net zero emissions. While this is a promising start, these fuels are currently expensive and scarce. Billions of dollars are being invested in this technology by the U.S. government, businesses, and philanthropists such as Bill Gates.

The critical factor is dedicated renewable energy. Without it, hydrogen fuels could generate more pollution than regular diesel. Texas's energy grid is only 40% renewable, with the remainder coming from natural gas and coal. This mix powers the Infinium plant.

Infinium creates chemical replicas of existing fuels by combining captured carbon with green hydrogen. A truck operating on this diesel would produce 89% fewer greenhouse gases than one using petroleum diesel.

The future may see heavy vehicles transition to pure hydrogen fuel cells, which emit only water vapor. However, for now, we need these chemical replicas to gradually reduce our dependence on oil.
