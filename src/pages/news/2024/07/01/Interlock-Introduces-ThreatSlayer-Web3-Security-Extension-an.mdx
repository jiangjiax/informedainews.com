Interlock, a cybersecurity firm, has launched ThreatSlayer, a Web3 security browser extension. It utilizes blockchain, AI, and a global user community to block malicious sites and safeguard against phishing and scams. This tool benefits over 29,000 weekly active users, predominantly outside the U.S.

The company encourages users to contribute anonymized security data, thereby enhancing collective threat intelligence. Future plans include the introduction of a utility coin, $ILOCK, for rewards and security staking on Arbitrum and Aleph Zero platforms. Further steps involve monetizing shared security data in the B2B threat intelligence market and releasing enterprise versions of their products.

Interlock's ecosystem, encompassing ThreatSlayer, Galactus, and Octahedron, aims to transform cybersecurity through Web3 technologies and community engagement. Rick Deacon, Interlock's CEO, is focused on resolving legacy Web2 security challenges with Web3 innovations.
