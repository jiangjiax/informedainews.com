Fathom Events, a joint venture between AMC, Regal, and Cinemark, is thriving. In 2023, it earned $100 million at the box office, a 116% increase from 2019. The first quarter of 2024 brought in $43 million, up nearly 140% compared to the previous year.

Fathom specializes in re-releasing classic films and live events such as theater, opera, and concerts. It also distributes specialty films and shows, including "The Chosen" and "Waitress: The Musical."

Anniversary re-releases are a significant attraction. Films like "The Wizard of Oz," "Gone with the Wind," and "Steel Magnolias" were celebrated. Upcoming anniversaries include "Blazing Saddles," "Rear Window," and "Mean Girls."

Studio Ghibli Fest features all 14 films from the studio, celebrating milestones like "Howl's Moving Castle" and "Kiki's Delivery Service."

"Coraline" had a successful 3D re-release, generating $7.1 million in ticket sales. Presales for this year's screenings are robust, with two-thirds choosing the 3D version.

Fathom's extensive reach and marketing capabilities benefit smaller theater chains, managing licensing and promotion for classic film re-releases.
