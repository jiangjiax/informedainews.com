Germany plans to remove Huawei and ZTE from its 5G networks within five years. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser emphasized protecting the economy and communications. Major telecoms like Deutsche Telekom agreed to phase out Chinese components by 2026 in core areas and by 2029 in other parts. This move follows similar bans in several European countries and the U.S. The decision, based on security assessments, aims to prevent sabotage and espionage.
