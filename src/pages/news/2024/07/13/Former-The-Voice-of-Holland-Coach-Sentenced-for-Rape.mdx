Dutch court jailed Ali B, a former The Voice of Holland coach, for two years for raping "Naomi" in 2018. He denies the charge and plans to appeal. Ali B faced multiple sexual misconduct allegations, marking a significant #MeToo movement in the Netherlands. The Voice of Holland, a popular talent show, faced scrutiny over its handling of these allegations, leading to its suspension in 2022.
