Trump's team wants his New York conviction tossed. They cite a recent Supreme Court ruling on ex-presidential immunity. Judge Juan Merchan delayed sentencing to consider this.

Trump's lawyers argue that evidence from his presidency, such as communications with Hope Hicks and his pardon power, should not have been used. They claim these are "core" presidential duties, now protected by the Supreme Court.

The case revolves around hush money paid to Stormy Daniels to silence her about an alleged affair with Trump. He denies the affair and did not testify.

Trump's lawyers also claim the case is politically motivated, targeting District Attorney Alvin Bragg. They argue the prosecution rushed without considering the Supreme Court's guidance on immunity.

This legal battle could impact Trump's other case in Florida, where he is accused of mishandling classified documents. His team is using the same Supreme Court ruling to seek a stay in that case.
