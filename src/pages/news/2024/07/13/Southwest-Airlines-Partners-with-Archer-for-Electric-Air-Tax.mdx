Southwest Airlines has partnered with Archer Aviation to develop an electric air taxi network in California. The service will utilize Archer's Midnight aircraft, a four-passenger, battery-powered, tilt-rotor vehicle designed for vertical takeoff and landing. This partnership provides access to 14 airports operated by Southwest. Archer asserts that their air taxis can shorten 60-90 minute car journeys to just 10-20 minutes.

Archer, which came out of stealth mode in 2020, has encountered legal hurdles but has also secured a $1 billion order from United Airlines and a production agreement with Stellantis. They have recently obtained FAA certification for an on-demand air taxi service, with plans to launch in 2025. The collaboration includes involvement from Southwest's unions, such as the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association.
