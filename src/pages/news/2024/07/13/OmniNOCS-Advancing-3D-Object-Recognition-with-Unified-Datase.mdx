OmniNOCS introduces a comprehensive dataset for 3D object recognition from 2D images, featuring 20 times more object categories and 200 times more instances than prior datasets. The NOCSformer model, leveraging transformers, predicts 3D shapes and positions from 2D detections, matching the performance of leading 3D detection models. Distinctively, NOCSformer also provides detailed object shapes and segmentations. A new benchmark for NOCS prediction is established, intended to steer future research. The dataset and code are accessible online.
