China leads the formulation of global railway autonomous driving ISO standards. At the ISO/TC269/SC3 meeting in Stockholm, Sweden, experts from 13 countries unanimously approved China's proposal. Led by the China Academy of Railway Sciences, a special working group was established to study the impact of autonomous driving on railway operations and propose operational guidelines. China holds a dominant position in global autonomous railway systems, contributing 68% of the total mileage and 97% of passenger mileage. Since 2016, China's railways have continuously made breakthroughs in autonomous driving technology, setting new benchmarks.
