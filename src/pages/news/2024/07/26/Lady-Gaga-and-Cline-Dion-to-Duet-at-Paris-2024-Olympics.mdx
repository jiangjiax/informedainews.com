Lady Gaga and Céline Dion are set to duet at the Paris 2024 Olympic opening ceremony. They'll perform Édith Piaf’s ‘La Vie en Rose’.

Dion, diagnosed with Stiff Person Syndrome in 2022, hasn't performed since 2020. This comeback marks a significant return. She's been relaxing in Paris, staying at the Royal Monceau.

Gaga, also in Paris, was seen at the Louvre and on the Seine. Both singers are fluent in French, making the performance fitting.

France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, hinted at the duet, keeping details secret. He praised Dion's potential presence at the ceremony.

Dion's last Olympic performance was in 1996 at Atlanta. She's been working hard to regain strength post-diagnosis. Her goal: to see the Eiffel Tower again.

This duet promises a blend of global superstardom and French heritage, a fitting tribute for the Olympic Games in Paris.
