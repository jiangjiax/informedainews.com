Chinese state firms plan to invest 3 trillion yuan ($413.8 billion) over five years to upgrade equipment, as announced by Liu Shaowei from the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) at a press conference. The investment aims to modernize aging equipment with high-tech, efficient, and environmentally-friendly alternatives.

SASAC will support and guide these firms, focusing on technological and industrial advancements. Central enterprises, including China Railway Group and China Petrochemical, will lead this initiative. Investment in strategic emerging industries rose 16.9% in the first half of 2024, with R&D spending reaching 434 billion yuan.

The government also announced 300 billion yuan in subsidies for equipment upgrades and consumer goods replacements, including subsidies for new energy vehicles and household appliances. These funds are part of a 1 trillion yuan ultralong government bond issuance.

Shares of Chinese appliance makers surged following the announcement, providing a boost to the market.
