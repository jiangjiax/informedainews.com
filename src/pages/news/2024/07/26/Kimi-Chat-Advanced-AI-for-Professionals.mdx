Kimi Chat, launched by Moon's Dark Side in 2023, supports up to 200 million characters in context, far exceeding competitors like ChatGPT 4. It caters to various professionals: academics, programmers, content creators, and legal experts, aiding in research, coding, and content creation.

Key features include real-time internet search, efficient document reading, and professional file interpretation. Kimi can summarize lengthy texts, assist in programming across languages, and organize complex data.

Available as a web app, browser extension, mobile app, and WeChat mini-program, Kimi's usage is widespread, with over 20 million web visits in April 2024.

Pricing is token-based, with models varying by context length. Kimi+ offers specialized services in fields like medicine and law, enhancing precision and efficiency.

Users should note language limitations, content restrictions, and privacy concerns. Kimi excels in text-based assistance but isn't a substitute for expert advice in specialized fields.
