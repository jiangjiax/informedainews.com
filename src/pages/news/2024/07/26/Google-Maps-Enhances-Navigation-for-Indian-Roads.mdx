Google Maps is updating for India. New AI helps drivers avoid narrow roads and tricky flyovers. It uses satellite images and Street View to judge road width and obstacles.

For cars, bikes, and walkers, Maps now shows safer routes. It warns if a narrow road is unavoidable. This feature starts in eight cities on Android, then iOS.

Flyover instructions are clearer now. Instead of "take a ramp," Maps says "take a flyover." This helps in 40 cities for cars, bikes, Android, and Android Auto. Apple’s CarPlay gets it soon.

EV charging stations are listed too. Over 8,000 stations show plug types. This includes two-wheeler chargers, important in India.

Google Maps partners with Namma Yatri and ONDC for local transport bookings. Metro tickets in Kochi and Chennai are available via Maps. More cities and transport options are coming.

Google’s "Where is my train?" app tracks trains and has over 100 million users.

Community features help users find top spots and report road issues easily. Lists for best cafes and breakfast places are now in major Indian cities.
