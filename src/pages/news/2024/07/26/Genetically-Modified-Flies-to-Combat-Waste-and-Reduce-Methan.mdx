Australian scientists are modifying the genetics of black soldier flies to consume more waste. These flies already feed on organic refuse, converting it into products we use: lubricants, biofuels, and animal feed. The objective? To reduce methane emissions from landfills.

Dr. Kate Tepper and Dr. Maciej Maselko, from Sydney's Macquarie University, are leading the project. They view insects as the next major solution to our waste crisis, which is substantial—approximately a billion tons of food waste annually.

The flies are ubiquitous except in Antarctica. Their larvae consume voraciously—doubling their weight daily. They decompose waste more rapidly than microbes. The team's spin-off, EntoZyme, aims to commercialize this technology by the end of the year.

Plans for the future include developing flies capable of processing contaminated waste, leaving behind fertilizer. They could also produce enzymes for various applications and fatty compounds for biofuels and lubricants.

The research, published in Communications Biology, indicates that engineered flies could neutralize pollutants, making waste safer and more valuable.
