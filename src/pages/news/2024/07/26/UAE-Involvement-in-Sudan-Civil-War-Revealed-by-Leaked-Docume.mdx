Leaked documents reveal UAE involvement in Sudan's civil war. Passports found on Sudanese battlefields link Emirati nationals to the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group. The UAE denies these claims.

The documents, sent to the UN, include images of Emirati passports found in Omdurman, a city recently reclaimed by the Sudanese army. Analysts call this evidence a "smoking gun," challenging UAE denials and raising questions about Western knowledge of Gulf state involvement.

The UAE is also accused of supplying RSF with drones equipped to drop thermobaric bombs, more devastating than conventional explosives. These bombs were recovered from Sudan's state broadcast headquarters in Omdurman.

This evidence forces a reevaluation of the conflict. Without UAE involvement, some experts believe the crisis might have ended sooner. The discovery of passports and bombs complicates the geopolitical landscape, challenging denials and demanding action.
