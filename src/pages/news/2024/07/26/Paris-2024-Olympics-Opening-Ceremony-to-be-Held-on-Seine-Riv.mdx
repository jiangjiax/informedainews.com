The Paris Olympic Opening Ceremony will be held on the Seine River, marking the first time in history that it is hosted outside a stadium. The artistic director of the ceremony, Thomas Jolly, describes it as "absolute creation and adventure." Athletes will travel through the heart of Paris on nearly a hundred boats, passing iconic landmarks such as the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower, before finally arriving at the Trocadéro Square.

The ceremony will include musical and dance performances, expected to attract 300,000 live spectators and over a billion viewers worldwide. Jolly emphasizes that it is a celebration of life and communal living. He has utilized the historical buildings along the Seine to minimize environmental changes and damage.

Security challenges and unpredictable weather conditions pose difficulties for an outdoor opening ceremony. Jolly's originally planned entirely free ceremony was adjusted due to safety concerns. Additionally, the ceremony will take place in natural light, utilizing the historical buildings along the Seine to minimize environmental changes and damage.

On the day of the ceremony, international stars such as Céline Dion will make appearances, performing classic songs. Jolly hopes that through the ceremony, the world will see France anew, a country that is constantly being constructed, deconstructed, and reconstructed.
