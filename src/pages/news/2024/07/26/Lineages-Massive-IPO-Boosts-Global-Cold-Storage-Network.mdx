Lineage, a leader in temperature-controlled warehouses, has just listed on the Nasdaq. They raised $4.4 billion, marking the largest IPO since Arm's listing last year. Lineage's stock surged 5% on its debut.

Starting with a single warehouse, they have since completed 116 acquisitions, constructing a network of over 480 facilities worldwide. These locations aid in storing food, reducing waste, and minimizing environmental impact.

Food waste is a significant issue, costing $600 billion annually and accounting for 11% of global emissions. Lineage's strategy involves a global network of cold-storage units to maintain food freshness and decrease spoilage.

Major banks such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs supported the IPO. Lineage's co-founder, Adam Forste, discussed their journey on CNBC's "Squawk Box," emphasizing their goal to transform a lineage of family-owned warehouses into a global food infrastructure.
