Jontay Porter, a former player for the Toronto Raptors, is facing federal charges related to a sports betting scandal. The NBA has banned him for life. Court documents filed in Brooklyn link Porter to a case involving four men who are accused of profiting from insider information about his early departures from games. Porter's attorney asserts that he suffers from a gambling addiction and is currently undergoing treatment. The NBA discovered that Porter provided bettors with information about his health and gambled on games, including those involving his own team. The four men are awaiting trial, charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud.
