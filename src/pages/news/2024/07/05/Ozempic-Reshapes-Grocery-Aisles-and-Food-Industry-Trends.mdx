Ozempic, a diabetes drug turned weight-loss sensation, is reshaping grocery aisles. Users like Raegan Sather report diminished appetites, skipping snack sections entirely. Food giants like Nestle and Coca-Cola are adapting, pushing high-protein, low-sugar options to cater to GLP-1 drug users.

Canada and the U.S. see a surge in GLP-1 drug use, with projections estimating nine percent of American adults on these meds by 2030. Analysts note a shift in food consumption, not just another diet fad.

Nestle's new line of prepared meals targets GLP-1 users, but dietitian Abby Langer warns against ultra-processed foods, advocating for home-cooked meals. Sather emphasizes Ozempic as a tool, not a cure-all, stressing the importance of healthy choices.
