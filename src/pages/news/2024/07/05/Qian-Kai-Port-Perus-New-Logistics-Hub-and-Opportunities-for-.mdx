Qiankai Port, located north of Lima, Peru, is an investment by Chinese enterprises. The construction of the port area is nearing completion, featuring four deep-water berths capable of accommodating large vessels. Designed to handle one million containers annually, with a long-term goal of 1.5 million.

The port is positioned as a hub, connecting to the Pan-American Highway, facilitating efficient cargo transportation. It enhances maritime efficiency and deepens trade with Asia. The project emphasizes green and low-carbon practices, with smart management, electric trucks, and autonomous driving.

The project employs approximately 3,000 local workers, with plans to support a workforce of 1,000 in future operations. It stimulates the logistics chain and significantly increases employment opportunities.

The China-Latin America Land-Sea Corridor shortens maritime transit times, benefiting small and medium-sized enterprises such as the "Warm Camel" brand by reducing transportation costs.

Qiankai Port is not just an engineering project but also a platform for cooperation. It fosters local employee growth, technical exchanges, and knowledge sharing. Peruvian students with Chinese language skills are eager to secure positions at the port.

As the project progresses, job opportunities are in high demand. The deepening friendship anticipates a journey to China. Qiankai Port represents a new opportunity for Peru, a development engine for the South American logistics value chain.
