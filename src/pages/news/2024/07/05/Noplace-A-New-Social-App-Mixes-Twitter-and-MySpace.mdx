Noplace, a new social app, has reached the top spot on the App Store. It combines elements of Twitter and MySpace, aiming to restore the social aspect of social media. Users can personalize their profiles with colors and details such as hobbies and fandoms. The app emphasizes text updates rather than photos or videos.

Tiffany Zhong, the founder, identified a gap in current social media platforms. She notes, "Everything is just media. It feels very disconnected." Noplace attempts to address this by allowing users to follow friends and connect with like-minded individuals in one centralized location.

The app utilizes AI for suggestions and summaries, rather than traditional algorithms. It provides two feeds: one for friends and one global. Profiles are public, and there is a moderation team in place to ensure safety.

Zhong launched Noplace last year with a small team. It gained popularity during its beta phase, attracting early adopters such as K-pop fans. The app competes with Twitter, now known as X, offering a similar text-based feed with enhanced social features.

Noplace is available for free on iOS and web, with monetization plans yet to be announced. It has received backing from investors including 776 and Forerunner Ventures, raising over $19 million to date.
