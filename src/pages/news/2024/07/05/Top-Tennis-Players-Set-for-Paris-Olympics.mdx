Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, and Andy Murray are set for the Paris Olympics. Djokovic, with 24 Grand Slam titles, seeks his first Olympic gold. Nadal, 38, has two Olympic golds and skipped Wimbledon to focus on Paris. Murray, also 37, plans to retire after the Games, aiming to add to his three major titles and two Olympic golds.

Iga Swiatek leads the women's entry list, with five Grand Slam wins, including four French Opens. Coco Gauff and Elena Rybakina join her, each with one major title. Aryna Sabalenka, ranked third, opts out due to Belarus' involvement in Ukraine.
