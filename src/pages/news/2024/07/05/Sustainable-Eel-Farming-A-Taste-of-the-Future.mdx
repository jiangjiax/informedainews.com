Japan's fisheries agency showcased eels grown from eggs, a first. These eels, once endangered, now offer a sustainable source. The process involves incubating eggs and raising eels to maturity. At a tasting event, both farmed and wild eels were served. Participants, including the agriculture minister, praised the farmed eels' taste and texture. The main challenge is the high production cost, roughly three times that of wild eels. Researchers aim to lower costs for wider accessibility.
