FlashAttention, by Dao et al., boosts neural network speed by optimizing memory and I/O operations. Introduced at NeurIPS 2022, it maintains fast and memory-efficient attention mechanisms.

FlashAttention-2, presented at ICLR 2024, further enhances parallelism and work distribution, accelerating attention processes.

Both papers aim to improve computational efficiency in neural networks, which is crucial for advancing AI.

**Explanation:**
- **Neural networks:** Computer systems modeled after the human brain, capable of learning from data.
- **Attention mechanisms:** Techniques in neural networks that help focus on specific parts of data.
- **Parallelism:** Simultaneously executing multiple tasks to speed up processing.
- **Computational efficiency:** Using fewer resources (like time and memory) to achieve the same task.
