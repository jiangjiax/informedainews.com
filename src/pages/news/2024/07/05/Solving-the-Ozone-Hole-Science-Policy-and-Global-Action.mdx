The ozone hole shocked the world in 1985. Scientists discovered a massive depletion over Antarctica, far worse than expected. The culprit? Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), chemicals used in aerosols and refrigerants. CFCs are persistent, traveling long distances without breaking down.

In 1986, a team led by Susan Solomon flew to Antarctica to gather data. They confirmed that CFCs were destroying ozone faster in the extreme cold. This discovery led to the Montreal Protocol, which banned CFCs globally. The ozone layer is now healing.

The story highlights the interplay between science, policy, and public awareness. It demonstrates how collective action can address environmental crises. The ozone hole remains a stark reminder of our impact on the planet.
