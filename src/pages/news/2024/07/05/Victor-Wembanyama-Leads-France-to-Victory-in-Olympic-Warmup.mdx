Victor Wembanyama led France to a 96-46 victory over Turkey in a basketball warmup match. The 20-year-old NBA star scored 24 points and grabbed six rebounds in front of a sold-out crowd. France aims for gold at the upcoming Paris Olympics.

Wembanyama, playing alongside Rudy Gobert, showcased his skills in defense and offense. Captain Nicolas Batum praised Wembanyama's impact, calling it a "great asset."

France lost to the U.S. in the Tokyo Olympics gold-medal game but hopes are high for a win at home. Wembanyama expressed eagerness to face Team USA and other legends.

France's basketball scene is thriving with new talents. This year's NBA draft saw five French players selected, including top picks Zaccharie Risacher and Alexandre Sarr.
