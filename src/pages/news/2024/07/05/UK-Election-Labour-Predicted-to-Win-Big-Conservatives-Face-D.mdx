Exit poll predicts Labour's thumping victory in UK election. Labour set to win 410 seats, Conservatives 131. Lib Dems 61, Reform 13, SNP 10, others 25. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer poised to become next prime minister.

Rishi Sunak's early election call backfired. Tories face a brutal reckoning after 14 years in power. Senior Tories, including cabinet ministers, could lose seats. The Liberal Democrats are on track to become the third largest party. The SNP is punished for internal turmoil.

Labour's "time for change" message resonates. The exit poll suggests Reform UK squeezed the Conservative vote. A Labour majority could secure a decade in power. Tories brace for a crushing defeat. Sunak is expected to resign as party leader.

Labour's victory gives Sir Keir a huge mandate to change Britain. Potentially beyond a cautious manifesto. Nvidia set to sell $12bn worth of AI chips in China despite US export controls. Chips restricted due to military use fears. Nvidia is the latest Silicon Valley company entangled in US-China tensions.
