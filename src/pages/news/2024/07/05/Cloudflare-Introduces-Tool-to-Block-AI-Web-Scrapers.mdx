Cloudflare has introduced a new tool to block AI web scrapers, utilizing AI to detect bots attempting to scrape content for training large language models (LLMs). This tool assigns a score to each website visit, with lower scores indicating a higher likelihood of the visitor being a bot. Cloudflare plans to regularly update the tool to counteract new bot tactics and also offers a reporting feature for website operators to flag new bots.

Web scraping involves the automatic collection of data from websites, while LLMs are advanced AI models designed to understand and generate human-like text.
