Scientists in Britain are establishing regulations for the growth of synthetic human embryos in laboratories. These embryos, crafted from stem cells, have the potential to develop heartbeats and spinal cords. Although they are not genuine embryos, they replicate certain characteristics of them.

This research is groundbreaking, and it is not entirely addressed by existing laws. The new guidelines are designed to specify the duration for which these synthetic embryos can be studied and to ensure that the research is conducted responsibly.

The guidelines also stipulate that these embryos must not be placed into a womb or permitted to develop into a complete organism. This measure is in place to avoid ethical concerns.

Researchers who adhere to these guidelines will find it simpler to secure funding and publish their findings. Those who do not comply may encounter scrutiny from their colleagues.

**Explanation of Terms:**
- **Stem Cells:** Fundamental cells capable of developing into various types of cells within the body.
- **SCBEMs (Stem Cell-Based Embryo Models):** Synthetic models of embryos created from stem cells, utilized for research.
