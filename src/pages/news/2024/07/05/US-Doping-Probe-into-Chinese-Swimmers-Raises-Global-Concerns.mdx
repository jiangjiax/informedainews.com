In 2021, 23 Chinese swimmers tested positive for doping but still competed and won medals at the Tokyo Olympics. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) accepted China's explanation of food contamination, a decision that was kept confidential until recently.

Now, just weeks before the Paris Olympics, Brent Nowicki, the international swimming federation's top administrator, has been ordered to testify in a U.S. criminal investigation. This investigation is under a federal law that allows probes into doping conspiracies, even if they occurred outside the U.S.

This case raises questions about WADA's effectiveness and China's sports ethics, and it highlights the challenges of enforcing anti-doping rules globally. The ongoing investigation could impact how officials from other countries interact with the U.S. in the future.
