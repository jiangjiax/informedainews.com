NASA's Juno spacecraft flew close to Io, Jupiter's moon, capturing detailed images of its volcanic surface. Io's landscape features hundreds of active volcanoes, some detectable by their heat.

The Mars Odyssey orbiter photographed Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in our solar system, offering a panoramic view of its massive, shield-like structure.

Japan's Astroscale successfully approached a piece of space debris, demonstrating potential solutions for managing Earth's growing space junk problem.

In May, intense solar storms triggered spectacular auroras, visible even in regions where they are rare. NOAA satellites documented these light shows from above the North Pole.

Japan's SLIM spacecraft achieved a pinpoint landing on the moon but unfortunately landed upside down, preventing its solar panels from functioning.
