NATO plans to deepen ties with Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea, issuing a joint document next week. The objective is to counter threats from China and Russia.

Known as "IP4," these four nations are already NATO partners and will participate in cyber exercises to address cybersecurity and disinformation threats.

This move indicates NATO's strategic shift towards the Indo-Pacific, aiming to strengthen collective defense in a region increasingly characterized by geopolitical tension.
