Sabrina Cohen-Hatton, once homeless, now advises Prince William on homelessness. She shared her journey from rough sleeping to a PhD and chief fire officer role. Prince William's Homewards project aims to end homelessness, challenging the notion that it's inevitable.

Homewards operates in six UK areas, focusing on prevention and support. Sabrina highlighted practical barriers like pet restrictions and confidence issues in accessing help. Prince William showed empathy, reflecting his own early life trauma.

The project collaborates with employers and Homebase for job support and furniture packs. Efforts include identifying at-risk youth and changing public attitudes. Finland's success in reducing homelessness is cited as inspiration.

Critics question a royal's role in addressing homelessness. Supporters, like George Anderson, see Prince William's high profile as beneficial. His mother, Princess Diana, also championed homelessness causes.

Homelessness remains a complex issue, but the project's approach offers hope and practical solutions.
