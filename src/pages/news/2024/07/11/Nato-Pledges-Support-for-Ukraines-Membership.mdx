NATO leaders pledged an "irreversible path" to Ukraine's membership. No timeline has been set, but support remains firm. A â‚¬40 billion aid package was promised, including F-16 jets.

Jens Stoltenberg, NATO's Secretary-General, emphasized that supporting Ukraine is in NATO's security interest. The summit in Washington DC focused on Ukraine's defense against Russia.

Ukraine has made progress on reforms. Formal NATO membership awaits the fulfillment of certain conditions. Volodymyr Zelensky met with leaders, including the UK's Sir Keir Starmer and US President Joe Biden.

The summit marked NATO's 75th anniversary. Amid US political turbulence, Biden reaffirmed support and called for increased defense spending among NATO members.
