Singapore has recently approved 16 insect species for human consumption, including crickets, grasshoppers, mealworms, and honeybees. The Singapore Food Agency has authorized the import of these insects to enhance food security in the land-limited city-state.

These insects must be cultivated, not wild-caught, and must be free from manure or diseased materials. Additionally, they require a heat or bactericidal treatment to ensure their safety.

This initiative is part of a larger strategy to diversify food sources, particularly in light of global challenges such as geopolitical tensions and climate change. The aim is to meet 30% of the country's nutritional needs locally by 2030.

The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization supports this transition, emphasizing the nutritional value and sustainability of insects compared to traditional livestock. Insects are rich in protein, fiber, and micronutrients such as zinc, calcium, and iron.

This decision is not merely about survival; it represents a step towards innovation. Singapore has already attracted startups, such as a Japanese silkworm producer, in anticipation of the regulatory shift.

For Singapore, this marks a bold move into a future where food is not just sustenance but a frontier of sustainable innovation.
