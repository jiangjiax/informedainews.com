Nintendo released a cryptic teaser for a game named "Emio" on YouTube. The fifteen-second video shows a person wearing a trench coat and a disturbing paper bag on their head, suggesting a horror title for the Switch. The trailer's unsettling piano music and the character's missing finger deepen the intrigue.

The teaser was promoted on Twitter with "#WhoIsEmio?" and was age-restricted, which is uncommon for Nintendo. Fans are wondering if this indicates Nintendo's venture into first-party horror gaming. The trailer hints at a possible viral alternate reality game (ARG), a kind of interactive story spread across various media platforms.

Nintendo typically aims to "put smiles on faces," but "Emio" seems to turn this into something more ominous. The online response is varied, with a mix of confusion and curiosity.
