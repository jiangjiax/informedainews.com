TSMC, June revenue reached NT$207.869 billion, a year-on-year increase of 32.9%. The first half of the year saw cumulative revenue of NT$1.26615 trillion, up 28%. The 3nm process is advancing steadily, with the N3P node scheduled for mass production in the second half of 2024. This year, plans are in place to build seven new factories, quadrupling 3nm production capacity. Its market capitalization on the US stock market surpassed the trillion-dollar mark, ranking seventh.

Capacity utilization stands at 60%, with 6/7nm processes set to see a 10% price reduction next year. Capital expenditure for 2025 is estimated at between $32-36 billion. Market capitalization is nearing the trillion-dollar threshold, prompting Wall Street to raise its target price. May sales amounted to NT$229.62 billion. The company repurchased 3.25 million shares to offset equity dilution. Salaries were increased by 3-5%, with the first quarter net profit reaching NT$225.5 billion, a 9% increase.

TSMC, the world's largest semiconductor foundry, focuses on chip manufacturing technologies such as the 3nm process, representing the most advanced chip production technology currently available.
