Spotify is adding comments to podcasts, making it more like a social network. Users can now chat directly with podcasters. Spotify is also mimicking TikTok with a discovery feed and allowing artists to sell merchandise and tickets through their profiles.

Maya Prohovnik, Spotify's VP, hints at potentially expanding comments to artist pages, which could boost engagement due to the size and activity of music fans.

Apple attempted something similar with iTunes Ping in 2010, but it failed. Spotify is taking a more gradual approach, quietly integrating social features.

Daniel Ek, Spotify's CEO, acknowledges TikTok's influence and is learning from trends to enhance the user experience.

Artists can now post short videos, akin to Stories, providing fans with updates on new releases and events. Users can follow friends and collaborate on playlists.

Spotify aims to keep users engaged and sharing thoughts, much like traditional social networks. This shift could challenge larger social platforms for user time and ad revenue.
