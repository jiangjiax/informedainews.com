Messi, 37, plans to continue playing for Argentina. He scored his 109th international goal in the recent victory over Canada. Messi's focus is on the present, not the future.

Teammate Ángel Di María, 36, intends to retire after the upcoming Copa America final. Di María has scored 31 goals in 144 appearances for Argentina.

Messi praised Di María, noting his dedication and the fitting nature of his retirement in a final. Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni hopes Di María might reconsider.

South American World Cup qualifying resumes in September. The 2026 World Cup final will be held at MetLife Stadium. Scaloni remains open to Di María's continued involvement, whether on the field or as a supportive presence.
