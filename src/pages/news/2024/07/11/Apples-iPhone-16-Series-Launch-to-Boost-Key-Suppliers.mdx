Apple's iPhone 16 series launch is expected to boost several supplier stocks, according to Bank of America. The bank anticipates a production run of 90-100 million units in the second half of this year, slightly higher than last year's 90 million. Key features rumored for the iPhone 16 Pro include a larger screen and a periscope camera.

BofA's top picks include:
- **Hon Hai Precision (Foxconn)**: The largest contract electronics manufacturer. BofA raised its price target to 260 New Taiwan dollars, expecting a 15.3% upside.
- **Foxconn Industrial Internet**: A subsidiary focusing on iPhone cases. BofA lifted its earnings forecast for 2024-26, anticipating a 13.8% stock rise.
- **Luxshare Precision**: A Chinese electronics maker with significant exposure to various iPhone components. BofA increased its price target to 46 Chinese yuan, predicting an 11.1% upside.
- **BYD Electronic**: Expected to benefit from consolidating its iPhone casing business. BofA set a price target of 42 Hong Kong dollars, forecasting a 25.3% potential gain.

These companies are poised to capitalize on the iPhone's evolution, driven by design changes and AI functions.
