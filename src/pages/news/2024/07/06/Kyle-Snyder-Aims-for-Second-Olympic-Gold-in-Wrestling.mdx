Kyle Snyder, 28, aims for his second Olympic gold in Paris. At 20, he was the youngest American to win Olympic wrestling gold in 2016. He's since won three NCAA titles and three world championships.

Snyder faces tough competition, notably Akhmed Tazhudinov, who beat him in 2023. Tazhudinov, 21, uses his reach and defensive skills to exploit opponents' errors.

Snyder thrives on challenge, crediting his dominance to facing tough practice partners. His coach, Bill Zadick, praises his intelligence and innovation.

Despite missing rivals like Abdulrashid Sadulaev, barred due to the Ukraine-Russia war, Snyder remains focused. He mentors younger wrestlers, sharing his experience and techniques.

Snyder's journey reflects his resilience and dedication, making him a formidable contender in Paris.
