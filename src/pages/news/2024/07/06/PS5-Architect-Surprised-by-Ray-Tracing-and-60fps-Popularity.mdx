Mark Cerny, the chief architect of the PS5, is surprised by the widespread adoption of ray tracing and 60fps in games. He anticipated that these technologies would become popular later in the console's lifecycle. Surprisingly, many launch games already incorporate ray tracing. Cerny also observes the shift from 30fps to 60fps, which significantly enhances gameplay.

Regarding PS5 games on PC, Cerny mentions that porting is simpler than expected but necessitates a stronger CPU and memory. The unique features of the PS5, such as its high-speed SSD, are driving advancements in PC hardware.
