In New York, McDonald's is offering $5 meals, which include a cheeseburger, fries, nuggets, and a drink. This initiative comes amid rising inflation that is prompting Americans to cut back on spending. Starbucks and other fast-food chains are also reducing prices to appeal to cost-conscious consumers.

Similar trends are observed in Japan. KFC Japan has reduced lunch prices by 40 yen following a sales decline caused by a previous price increase. Skylark Holdings and Saizeriya have also lowered their prices, despite increasing operational costs.

China's job market is facing difficulties, encouraging consumers to opt for more affordable meals. Haidilao, a hot pot chain, has opened a low-cost branch that utilizes automation to maintain lower prices. Yonghe King is offering breakfasts for as little as 6 yuan.

Each country is dealing with distinct economic issues: inflation in the U.S., stagnant wages in Japan, and job scarcity in China. Restaurants are responding by reducing prices to attract customers back.
