Samsung's profit surged 1,452.2% in Q2 2024, reaching 10.4 trillion won. Revenue increased by 23.3% to 74 trillion won. The surge was driven by a rebound in memory chip sales.

Samsung trails SK Hynix in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are critical for AI. SK Hynix supplies Nvidia, a major player in AI GPUs. Samsung is working to qualify as a supplier to Nvidia.

The new semiconductor leadership aims to narrow the gap and enhance product competitiveness.
