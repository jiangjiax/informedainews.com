The SCO Summit in Kazakhstan was a game-changer. The final declaration highlighted the growing shift in geopolitics and emphasized the SCO's role in creating a new international order. The 10 member states, including new member Belarus, expressed support for a fair solution to the Palestinian issue and opposed unilateral sanctions. They also aim to create a SCO investment fund and a new security architecture in Eurasia. The summit showcased the SCO's evolution into a geoeconomic cooperation, covering 80% of the Eurasian landmass and accounting for a significant share of global GDP and trade value. The meeting of the SCO+ further strengthened multilateral dialogue with the participation of key partners such as Azerbaijan, Qatar, Turkiye, and others. Russian President Vladimir Putin's bilaterals with these partners were substantial. Overall, the summit underscored the SCO's growing influence and its potential to reshape international dynamics.
