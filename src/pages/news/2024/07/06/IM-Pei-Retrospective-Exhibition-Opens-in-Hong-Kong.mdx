I.M. Pei, the architect renowned for iconic structures such as the Louvre's pyramid and the Bank of China tower, now has a retrospective exhibition. "I.M. Pei: Life is Architecture" opened on June 29 at the M+ Gallery in Hong Kong and will run until January 5. The exhibition covers 160,000 square meters and showcases over 400 items, many of which have never been seen even by his sons.

Born in Guangzhou, Pei grew up in Hong Kong and Shanghai before moving to the U.S. in 1935 to pursue his studies. He was awarded the Pritzker Prize in 1983. His designs seamlessly blend Western and Asian influences.

Curators Shirley Surya and Aric Chen dedicated a decade to preparing this exhibition. They delved into Pei's early works, including his period in real estate after graduating from Harvard, a phase seldom discussed.

This exhibition marks a significant milestone for M+, showcasing a career that spanned decades and continents.
