A North Dakota tribe, the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation, is constructing a massive greenhouse. This project, dubbed Native Green Grow, seeks to reestablish their ancestral farming heritage. The tribe's land was inundated in the 1950s by the Garrison Dam, resulting in the creation of Lake Sakakawea. This new greenhouse, upon completion, will rank among the largest in the world, spanning 14.5 acres.

The initial phase, with a budget of $76 million, encompasses a 3.3-acre greenhouse, a warehouse, and additional facilities. This infrastructure will enable the tribe to cultivate a diverse range of crops, from lettuce to strawberries. The tribe intends to supply food to their reservation and beyond, including to food banks in remote regions.

This endeavor aligns with a broader movement among tribes to achieve food sovereignty. The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the necessity for self-reliant food systems. The USDA supports this through its Indigenous Food Sovereignty Initiative, which advocates for indigenous farming practices and food independence.

The tribe's project is viable due to access to potable water and natural gas from the Bakken oil field. They plan to utilize this gas for heating and fertilization, mitigating environmental concerns related to flaring.

In summary, the greenhouse signifies a substantial stride toward self-sufficiency and cultural rejuvenation for the tribe.
