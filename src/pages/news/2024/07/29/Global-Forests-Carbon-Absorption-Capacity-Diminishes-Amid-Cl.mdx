High temperatures, droughts, and wildfires in 2023 weakened Earth's forests, reducing their ability to absorb carbon dioxide. This study, though preliminary, is alarming as it suggests a critical buffer against climate change is failing. Despite modest fossil fuel emissions, carbon dioxide levels rose, indicating a significant drop in the planet's carbon absorption capacity. Key areas affected include the Amazon, Southeast Asia, and Canada's boreal forests, which have been severely impacted by drought and fires.

**Carbon Sink:** A natural or artificial reservoir that stores carbon-containing compounds, thereby reducing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
