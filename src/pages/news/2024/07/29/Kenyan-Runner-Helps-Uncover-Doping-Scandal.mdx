Victor Burgos, chief investigator at Usada, met a Kenyan runner in New York. The runner had tested positive for 19-nortestosterone, a steroid. Burgos offered a deal: help catch other dopers, keep running.

The runner was shocked, initially denied. Burgos suggested a walk, a coffee. They talked. Burgos explained the runner’s options, the gravity of his situation. The runner listened, understood.

Burgos knew the runner trained in Kenya, a camp with strict anti-doping policies. The runner was now headed to a US camp, known for its long mountain trails and altitude training. Some athletes there used performance-enhancers, EPO and steroids.

Burgos weighed the runner’s potential. An established Olympian might not talk; this runner, more likely. Burgos decided to approach personally, avoid the usual legalized notice. He wanted to soften the blow, ensure the runner didn’t walk away distraught.

They met, talked. Burgos laid out the opportunity. The runner considered, accepted. Burgos saw a chance to make a difference, catch others. The runner saw a way to continue, contribute.

In the end, it was a deal. The runner would help, Burgos would help the runner. Both aimed to clean up the sport, one step at a time.
