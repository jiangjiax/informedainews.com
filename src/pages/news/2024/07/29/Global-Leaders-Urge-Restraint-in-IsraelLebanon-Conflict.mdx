Global leaders urge Israel to halt attacks on Lebanon, fearing a broader war. A rocket strike killed 12 children in the Golan Heights, sparking international diplomacy. The White House blames Hezbollah, while seeking a diplomatic solution to end all attacks.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and French President Emmanuel Macron emphasize the need to prevent conflict escalation. The UN calls for maximum restraint, warning of a catastrophic regional war.

In Israel, public anger grows over the strike in Majdal Shams. Funeral processions for the children draw thousands. Netanyahu vows revenge, cutting short a US visit to address the crisis. Israeli jets retaliate with strikes on southern Lebanon.

Hezbollah denies responsibility for the attack, attributing it to a malfunctioning Iron Dome missile. US envoy Amos Hochstein engages with Lebanese leaders to ease tensions.

Mediators, including CIA head William Burns and Mossad's David Barnea, meet in Rome to negotiate a Gaza ceasefire and secure the return of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. Hezbollah's Hassan Nasrallah suggests halting attacks on Israel's northern border if Gaza fighting stops.

Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon intensify, causing displacement on both sides. Lebanon's foreign minister requests US intervention to curb Israeli aggression and Hezbollah's retaliation.
