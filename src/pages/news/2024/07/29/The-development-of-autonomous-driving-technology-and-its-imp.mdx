Autonomous vehicles, benefiting from artificial intelligence, are rapidly developing. Wuhan has become the first city to commercially deploy driverless taxis, sparking widespread discussion.

1. **Safety**: Autonomous driving is safer than human driving, relying on high-precision sensors and algorithms, with a very low chance of errors.
2. **Hybrid Driving Risks**: These are difficult to resolve in the short term; an ideal solution is to restrict human drivers from the roads.
3. **Role of Safety Officers**: With technological advancements, the responsibilities of safety officers are shifting towards remote assistance and takeover.
4. **Traffic Congestion**: Autonomous driving may alleviate congestion, but the complexities of urban functional zoning and the allocation of living and working spaces remain challenging.
5. **Car Ownership Perceptions**: Autonomous taxis, similar to buses, have low usage costs, diminishing the significance of private car ownership.
6. **Vehicle Form**: Autonomous driving frees up the driver's seat, opening up interior space functions, and vehicles may become mobile functional spaces.
7. **Technical Level**: Domestic autonomous driving technology is on par with international standards, and vehicle-road coordination still holds value in specific scenarios.
8. **New Career Opportunities**: Technological evolution brings new professions, such as cloud chauffeur safety officers, prompting society to consider new models and opportunities.

Autonomous driving is not just a technological revolution but also a profound impact on urban planning, transportation systems, and social employment. Future cities need to imaginatively envision a friendly human-machine-environment system.
