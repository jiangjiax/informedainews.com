Coronary heart disease, one of the fatal illnesses, has been difficult to detect with traditional imaging techniques due to the small blood vessels within the heart muscle. Professor Tang Mengxing and his team have broken through technological barriers by developing ultrasound localization microscopy, which has achieved the first in vivo super-resolution imaging of the heart.

This technology utilizes ultrasound waves and micron-sized bubbles to generate high-definition images of microvessels within the heart muscle, setting a new standard for spatial resolution. This breakthrough not only enhances our understanding of microvascular coronary artery disease but also opens new avenues for early detection of heart conditions.

Reviewers have praised it as the highest-resolution image of the coronary vascular system in vivo, signaling a revolution in the diagnosis and treatment of heart disease. Additionally, the technology holds broad potential and may be applied to areas such as tumors and brain diseases in the future.

Professor Tang emphasized that while initial success has been achieved, further technical optimization and extensive clinical research are needed to fully realize its clinical and research value. The team is currently collaborating with clinical experts from multiple fields to explore the potential applications of super-resolution ultrasound technology in other diseases.
