Simone Biles returned to the Olympics, leading the all-around qualifying with a score of 59.566. The Bercy Arena was filled with excitement, with celebrities such as Tom Cruise and Ariana Grande in attendance. Biles had a challenging start on the balance beam, notorious for its unpredictability, but she handled it smoothly, setting a high standard for her comeback.

Despite a calf injury, Biles persevered, qualifying first on vault and floor, and second on the beam. Her performance on the uneven bars made her the first alternate. Rivals like Rebeca Andrade and Sunisa Lee also delivered strong performances, though Biles remained at the forefront.

Biles' coach, CÃ©cile Canqueteau-Landi, minimized the impact of the injury, noting Biles' determination to compete. Biles herself stayed positive, smiling and conversing with teammates despite the discomfort. Her resilience was evident, particularly during her floor and vault routines, where she executed complex moves with accuracy.
