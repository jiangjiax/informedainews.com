Saudi researchers have developed NanoRanger technology, a rapid method for gene detection. It can diagnose Mendelian genetic diseases within a few hours, a significant advancement compared to the six-year wait with traditional methods. NanoRanger efficiently identifies gene mutations through molecular biology strategies, with low costs and minimal sample requirements. The technology has successfully diagnosed 13 cases of familial genomic diseases that were missed by traditional tests, helping families avoid tragic genetic diseases.

Mendelian genetic diseases: Inherited disorders caused by mutations in a single gene, such as cystic fibrosis.
Molecular biology strategies: Scientific methods that study biological processes at the molecular level.
