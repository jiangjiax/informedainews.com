Deadpool & Wolverine, a Marvel flick, raked in $205 million in its opening weekend in North America. This figure tops the previous R-rated record set by the first Deadpool, at $132 million. Globally, the movie grossed over $438.3 million.

The film's success marks a significant comeback for Marvel Studios, which has faced recent box office disappointments. It also highlights a crucial moment for the film industry, struggling with lower box office returns compared to the previous year.

Critics and audiences alike have responded positively, with an A CinemaScore rating. Marvel Studios president, Kevin Feige, announced at San Diego Comic-Con that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has now surpassed $30 billion in box-office earnings.

In a surprising turn, Robert Downey Jr. announced his return to Marvel, but not as Iron Man. Instead, he will portray the villain Doctor Doom in upcoming Avengers films.
