June's heat broke records, marking the 13th straight month of global temperature highs. Copernicus, the European climate service, reported a 1.5-degree Celsius increase over pre-industrial levels. This trend aligns with the Paris Agreement's critical threshold.

Nicolas Julien, a senior climate scientist at Copernicus, warns of rapid global warming. The 1.5-degree mark signifies a significant milestone, though actual danger might take 20 to 30 years to manifest fully.

Extreme events—floods, storms, droughts, and heatwaves—are already worsening. June's heat was particularly severe in southeast Europe, Turkey, eastern Canada, and the western U.S. Ocean temperatures also set records for the 15th consecutive month.

The primary cause of this warming is greenhouse gas emissions from coal, oil, and natural gas. El Ninos and cleaner air over Atlantic shipping lanes also contribute, albeit indirectly.

Climate scientists like Andrew Dessler and Andrea Dutton emphasize the escalating crisis. Dessler notes the disparity in impacts between the rich and poor, while Dutton highlights the increasing likelihood of climate-driven disasters.

The streak of record-breaking months may soon end, but the underlying climate chaos persists. Urgent action to curb emissions is imperative.
