Coffee Stain Studios plans to end Early Access for "Satisfactory" on September 10. The game, a sprawling factory builder, has seen significant updates. The upcoming 1.0 release will refine gameplay and systems, finalize narrative elements, and enhance world details.

Key features at launch include mod support, dedicated servers, and an achievements system. Anticipated price increases make the current summer sale a good entry point. The team values player feedback, maintaining an open dialogue with the community.
