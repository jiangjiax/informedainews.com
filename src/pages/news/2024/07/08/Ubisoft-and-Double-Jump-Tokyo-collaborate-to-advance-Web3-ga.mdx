Ubisoft and Double Jump Tokyo have joined forces to advance the application of Web3 and NFT technologies in the game "Champion Tactics." The goal is to accelerate the global adoption of Web3 gaming technology. Didier Genevois, Ubisoft's Web3 Technology and Product Director, emphasized that this collaboration aims to explore the integration of decentralized technologies with gaming. Ubisoft plans to issue in-game NFTs, such as unique avatar images, through the Oasys Layer 2 HOME Verse blockchain. Despite the failure of the previous "Quartz Project," Ubisoft remains committed to exploring the use of NFTs in games. "Champion Tactics" is scheduled for release later this year, with only the PC version currently confirmed.

NFT (Non-Fungible Token): A digital asset based on blockchain technology, each NFT is unique and can be used to prove ownership of digital items.
