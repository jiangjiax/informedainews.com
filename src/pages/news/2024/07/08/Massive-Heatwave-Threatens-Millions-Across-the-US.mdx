A massive heatwave grips the US, affecting 134 million people. Temperatures soar 15 to 30 degrees above average, mostly in the west. The National Weather Service warns of potential record-breaking heat.

In Oregon, cities like Eugene, Portland, and Salem brace for record highs. Cooling centers open nationwide. At Portland's Waterfront Blues Festival, attendees cope with heat using cold water, shade, and water misters.

Death Valley, California, hits 127F, breaking its previous record of 122F. More extreme highs are forecasted, including 130F in Death Valley. The hottest temperature ever recorded on Earth was 134F in 1913, though some dispute this.

The intense heat, coupled with winds and low humidity, heightens wildfire risks. Red flag warnings are in effect across California. Over two dozen wildfires burn, with the Thompson fire in Butte County forcing evacuations and destroying structures.

The eastern US also faces high temperatures. Baltimore and Maryland are under excessive heat warnings. Heat index values could reach 110F.

In Maricopa County, Arizona, at least 13 confirmed heat-related deaths have occurred this year, with more under investigation. A 10-year-old boy died in Phoenix after a heat-related medical event while hiking.
