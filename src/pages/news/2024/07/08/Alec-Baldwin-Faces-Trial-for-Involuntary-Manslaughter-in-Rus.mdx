Alec Baldwin faces trial for involuntary manslaughter over the fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of Rust in 2021. The case has drawn widespread attention, with prosecutors arguing Baldwin's negligence led to Hutchins' death. Baldwin claims the gun malfunctioned; however, forensic analysis suggests he pulled the trigger.

The defense alleges FBI testing damaged the weapon, potentially skewing results. Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer denied a dismissal request, noting the prosecution must inform the jury of the testing's destructive nature.

Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, Rust's armorer, was previously convicted of involuntary manslaughter, complicating Baldwin's case. Prosecutors must now prove Baldwin's negligence beyond Gutierrez-Reed's involvement.

Baldwin's past comments and behavior on set, deemed reckless by some, could undermine his defense. His role as producer also raises questions about his oversight responsibilities.

Halyna Hutchins' family, represented by attorney Gloria Allred, seeks accountability, emphasizing the need for justice to prevent future tragedies. The trial promises to be a pivotal moment in the intersection of Hollywood and criminal law.
