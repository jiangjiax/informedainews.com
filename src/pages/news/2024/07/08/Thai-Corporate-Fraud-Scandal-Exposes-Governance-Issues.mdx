BANGKOK â€” Vonnarat Tangkaravakoon, once a tycoon, now sits in a courtroom, accused of a $409.8 million fraud. His company, Stark Corp., duped investors with false financials and bogus sales. The scandal implicates Kasikornbank, Deloitte, and Credit Suisse.

Stark raised 10.7 billion baht through debentures, plus 5.58 billion baht from stock sales. These funds, meant for expansion, were used to repay debts. A PwC audit revealed "unusual transactions" and "material misstatements."

Investors, including retirees, have filed class-action lawsuits. The defendants face potential damages of up to 27 billion baht. The case aims to set a new standard for Thai corporate governance.

Stark's financial maneuvers, including repeated debenture issuances for debt servicing, should have raised red flags. The company's low-margin products and rising input costs further strained its finances.

This scandal underscores the need for rigorous oversight and transparency in corporate practices.
