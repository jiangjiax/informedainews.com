NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, has finalized three post-quantum encryption standards. These standards aim to safeguard data against future quantum computer attacks.

The standards include:
- ML-KEM for general encryption.
- ML-DSA and SLH-DSA for digital signatures.

A fourth algorithm, FN-DSA, is expected later this year. NIST is also evaluating additional backup algorithms, based on different mathematical principles.

Dustin Moody, a NIST mathematician, urges immediate adoption of the new standards. Full integration takes time, and preparation against potential attacks is crucial.

These standards are part of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Project, designed to ensure data security in an era of advanced computing threats.
