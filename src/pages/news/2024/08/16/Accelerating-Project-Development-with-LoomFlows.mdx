LoomFlows accelerates project work by integrating Loom videos—short screen recordings—with annotated screenshots, allowing users to add notes to images. This tool streamlines bug fixes, feature requests, and testimonial collection with minimal effort. "Zero(ish) friction" characterizes a nearly seamless workflow.

Loom videos are concise clips that capture screen activity. Annotated screenshots entail adding comments or marks directly onto images.
