Gimcheon Sangmu, a South Korean soccer team composed of military conscripts, is vying for the top spot in the K League. This marks a first for a military team in Asia’s oldest professional league.

Operated by the Korea Armed Forces Athletic Corps, Sangmu’s players serve 18 months of mandatory military duty, then return to their original clubs. Their current success is attributed to younger, talented players eager to complete their service early and a new coach, Chung Jung-yong, known for his work with young athletes.

Sangmu’s rise is also due to the struggles of traditional powerhouse clubs, which rely heavily on corporate funding. Economic uncertainties have forced these clubs to cut spending, opening the door for less traditional contenders.

Despite challenges like low attendance and limited local support, Sangmu remains competitive. With 12 games left, capturing the domestic title is a real possibility. The team’s resilience and unity under Coach Chung make them a formidable opponent.
