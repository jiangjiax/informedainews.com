Typhoon Ampil, a fierce storm off Japan's Honshu coast, barrels towards Kanto and Tohoku. Expected to hit Kanto on Friday and Tohoku on Saturday, it includes Tokyo in its path.

Heavy rain clouds threaten Kanto, Izu Islands, and Yamanashi. Meteorologists predict Ampil moving north-northeast at 15 kph, winds capable of damaging homes.

Sustained winds could hit 144 kph on Izu Islands and off Kanto, with gusts up to 216 kph. Rainfall forecasts warn of potential disaster: 300 mm in Kanto, 200 mm in Tohoku, and 120 mm in Tokai.

Warnings include violent winds, mudslides, and flooding. Evacuation orders are in place, with level four alerts in Mobara City and level three in parts of Tokyo and surrounding prefectures.

Power outages affect over a thousand households in Kanto. Stay alert, check weather updates, and seek sturdy shelter.
