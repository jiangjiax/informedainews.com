The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox a global health emergency for the second time. The virus, which causes painful lesions and can lead to severe illness or death, has surged again in Africa. This year, over 15,000 cases and nearly 500 deaths have been reported, marking a 160% increase from 2023.

Mpox spread rapidly worldwide in 2022, primarily through sexual networks and mainly affecting men who have sex with men. Vaccination efforts have reduced global case counts. However, a more transmissible form has emerged in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), spreading to neighboring countries like Rwanda and Uganda.

The Africa CDC estimates that 10 million vaccine doses are needed, but only 200,000 have been procured. The WHO is pushing for emergency use listing to accelerate vaccine access in lower-income countries.

Canada and the U.S. have pledged vaccine donations, but access remains limited in many parts of Africa. Without a coordinated international response, the virus could spread beyond Africa, threatening global health.

A new strain, clade Ib, is causing more severe disease and could pose a broader risk if it spreads globally. Early research suggests it may transmit through close household contact, affecting vulnerable populations like infants and children.
