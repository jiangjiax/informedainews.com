Paramount Global plans to cut 15% of its U.S. staff, shut down Paramount Television Studios, and shift projects to CBS Studios. The move aims to slash $500 million in annual costs and prep for a merger with Skydance Media.

Layoffs will hit about 2,000 employees, mostly by September. Paramount's co-CEOs cite an "inflection point" necessitating change.

The studio closure reflects industry shifts and a push for efficiency. All Paramount TV projects will move to CBS Studios, with some CBS staff also departing.
