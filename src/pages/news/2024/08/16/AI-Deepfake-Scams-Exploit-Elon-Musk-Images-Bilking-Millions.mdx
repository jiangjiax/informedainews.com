AI-generated Elon Musk images flood fake ads, bilking billions. Deepfake tech replicates voices, alters videos seamlessly. Pornographers, meme-makers, and scammers embrace this trend.

An 82-year-old, duped by a Musk-endorsed investment video, lost $690,000. Fraudsters tweaked a real interview, swapping Musk's voice with an AI clone. The altered video, costing mere dollars, spreads via social media ads.

Sensity, monitoring Deepfake videos, labels this the largest such scam. Fake Musk clips, mimicking his cadence and accent, dominate crypto ads. They often start with real footage, then sync lips and clone voices.

These ads, featuring news logos, deceive many. Musk tops Deepfake subjects, especially in crypto schemes. Victims invest small sums, then larger, as fake profits mount.

Musk, silent on this, remains a favorite for scammers. Authorities warn of rising AI cybercrimes. Criminals wield AI to enhance stealth and impact.
