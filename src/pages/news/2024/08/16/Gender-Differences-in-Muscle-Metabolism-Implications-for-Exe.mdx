Females and males process sugar and fatty acids differently in their muscles, according to a study. This distinction affects how their bodies utilize energy during exercise.

Female muscles excel at burning fat, whereas male muscles are more efficient at consuming sugar. These disparities arise from differences in muscle fiber types and metabolic pathways.

Grasping these differences could aid in customizing exercise regimens and nutritional guidance for improved health results. For example, females may derive greater benefits from endurance training, while males might achieve more significant improvements from high-intensity exercises.

This research highlights the significance of accounting for gender in sports science and medical interventions. It serves as a reminder that strategies effective for one gender may not yield the same benefits for the other.
