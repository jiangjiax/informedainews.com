Paetongtarn Shinawatra, 37, daughter of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was elected Thailand's new prime minister on August 16, 2024. She secured 319 votes from the lower house, surpassing the required majority. 491 lawmakers participated, with 145 voting against and 27 abstaining. No opposition candidates were nominated.

Paetongtarn expressed gratitude to her predecessor, Srettha Thavisin, who was removed by the Constitutional Court for appointing an ex-convict to his cabinet. She emphasized her readiness to work hard for the Thai people and mentioned a potential review of existing policies.

The new prime minister declined to discuss cabinet details or policies until receiving official royal endorsement. This is a standard procedure in Thailand, requiring parliamentary submission and royal approval before any official statements.

Paetongtarn's election marks a significant shift in Thailand's political landscape, with a focus on continuity and adaptability in governance.
