Breaking, born in the Bronx, made its Olympic debut in Paris. Phil (Wizard) Kim from Vancouver won gold, sparking global interest. Australian dancer Raygun faced ridicule online, but many see her inclusion as crucial for expanding the sport's reach.

Breaking isn't just about competition; it's about spreading the dance worldwide. Antonio Castillo, a breaker and founder of All 10 Breaking dance school, views the Olympic debut as historic. He emphasizes the dedication shown by competitors like Kim, who performed injured.

Geoff Reyes, president of Breaking Canada, believes the Olympics offer a broader audience but sees potential for breaking to develop its own professional leagues, akin to FIFA or the NBA.

Criticism of Raygun's performance highlights a misunderstanding of breaking's roots in Black and Latino communities. Cheryl Thompson, a researcher of Black performance art, argues that breaking was originally a community-building tool, not just a competitive sport.

The debate over breaking's Olympic inclusion reflects broader questions about the commercialization of hip-hop and the authenticity of its cultural expressions.
