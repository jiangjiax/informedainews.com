Biden's team has just reduced prices on 10 key drugs. Medicare now negotiates directly with drug manufacturers. This initiative, starting in 2026, aims to save $6 billion for Medicare and $1.5 billion for patients.

Here's the breakdown:
- Eliquis: $231 (previously $521)
- Jardiance: $197 (previously $573)
- Xarelto: $197 (previously $517)
- Januvia: $113 (previously $527)
- Farxiga: $178.50 (previously $556)
- Entresto: $295 (previously $628)
- Enbrel: $2,355 (previously $7,106)
- Imbruvica: $9,319 (previously $14,934)
- Stelara: $4,695 (previously $13,836)
- Fiasp and NovoLog: $119 (previously $495)

These price cuts are significant. They could lead to healthier, longer lives for many. The Inflation Reduction Act, which enabled these negotiations, marks a first in Medicare's history.

The actual impact? It's difficult to pinpoint exactly. Drug prices are often obscured by confidential rebates. However, these new rates establish a benchmark. More negotiations are forthcoming.

This move is not just about saving money. It's about ensuring access. It's about making sure older Americans can afford the medications they need.
