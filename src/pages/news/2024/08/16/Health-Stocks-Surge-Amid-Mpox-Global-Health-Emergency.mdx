Health stocks surged as the World Health Organization declared mpox a global health emergency. Danish vaccine maker Bavarian Nordic saw its shares jump by as much as 17%. The company, with an approved mpox vaccine, could meet growing demand for shots.

U.S. pharmaceutical company Emergent Biosolutions also benefited, with its ACAM2000 vaccine recommended by the CDC. Medical tools supplier Precision System Science Co. soared 40% in Tokyo.

The WHO's declaration follows an mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, spreading to neighboring countries. Mpox, a zoonotic disease, spreads from animals to humans, causing flu-like symptoms and lesions. A new variant, clade Ib, appears more contagious.

Cases surged in 2022, prompting a WHO emergency declaration, later lifted in May 2023. The new outbreak is concerning, especially among children. Vaccine access remains a challenge. The WHO is working to increase access, releasing $1.45 million and expecting an initial $15 million requirement.

Bavarian Nordic CEO Paul Chaplin stated the company could ramp up vaccine supply to 2 million doses by year-end and 10 million by 2025 if orders are placed promptly.
