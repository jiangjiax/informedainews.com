Linktree, a link-in-bio platform, has acquired Plann, a social media scheduling tool. Plann, based in Sydney, will initially operate as usual. Linktree plans to integrate Plann's scheduling features into its own platform, aiming to simplify content distribution for its 50 million users.

Linktree's CEO, Alex Zaccaria, emphasized the desire to streamline content management for creators, allowing them more time for creation. This acquisition is Linktree's fourth, following previous purchases of link-in-bio competitors and a music link aggregation platform.

Linktree also introduced a beta social commerce feature this year, enabling creators to add storefronts to their bio pages and earn commissions on sales.
