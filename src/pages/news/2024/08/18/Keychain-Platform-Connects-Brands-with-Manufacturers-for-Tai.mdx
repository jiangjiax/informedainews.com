Keychain, a startup by Oisin Hanrahan, aims to bridge the gap between consumer brands and manufacturers. Hanrahan, previously of Handy and ANGI Homeservices, launched Keychain in February 2023 after raising $18 million. The platform connects brands directly with over 24,000 manufacturers, indexing more than 760,000 products.

Brands use Keychain to find and collaborate with manufacturers, potentially creating private label products or healthier alternatives. The platform has already facilitated $500 million in manufacturing deals.

Keychain's expansion includes an Austin office and partnerships with companies like Rich Products and Aura Bora. Mitchell Madoff, formerly of Whole Foods, leads retail partnerships.

Hanrahan sees demand driven by U.S. trade policies and consumer preferences for tailored products. His vision is to create a comprehensive software layer connecting all aspects of the supply chain, from production to packaging.
