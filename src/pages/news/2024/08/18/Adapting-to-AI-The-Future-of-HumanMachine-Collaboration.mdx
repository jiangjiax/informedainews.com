The world is changing rapidly due to smart technologies. Humans must adapt or risk obsolescence. The rise of technosubjects—machines capable of self-development—blurs the line between man and machine. This cyborgization could lead to a split between natural and augmented humans, mirroring conflicts seen in games like Deus Ex and Cyberpunk.

New social groups, like "centaurs"—human-robot teams—are forming. These unions are more efficient than traditional groups. The Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) are merging with the Internet of People, creating an Internet of Everything. This integration transforms the physical and digital worlds into a unified space.

Virtual reality and blockchain technology are pushing society towards total decentralization. Physical presence will become obsolete as virtual interactions become more immersive. Offices, theaters, and stadiums may disappear as robots take over jobs and blockchain ensures transparent interactions.

To survive, humans must rethink education and governance. Adaptation is no longer optional; it's essential for preserving our place as the smartest species on the planet.
