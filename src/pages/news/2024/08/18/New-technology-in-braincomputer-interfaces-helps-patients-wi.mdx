The research team at the University of California, Davis, has developed a new type of brain-computer interface technology that can convert brain signals into speech with 97% accuracy. This technology brings hope to patients with language disorders such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). In the study, a 45-year-old ALS patient, Kathy Harell, successfully expressed her thoughts through a device implanted in her brain.

The technology implants sensors in the brain to interpret brain signals during speech, converts them into text, and then has the computer read it out. Harell conducted 84 experiments over 32 weeks, engaging in over 248 hours of autonomous conversations through the system. The system's initial accuracy was 99.6%, stabilizing at 97.5% after training.

The research team plans to apply the technology to more patients in the coming years and expand its capabilities, such as adding intonation and singing abilities. Despite challenges such as portability and infection risks, the high precision of this technology offers hope to those who have lost their language abilities.
