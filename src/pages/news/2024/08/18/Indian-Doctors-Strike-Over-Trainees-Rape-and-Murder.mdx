Doctors across India staged a 24-hour strike, turning away non-emergency patients to protest the rape and murder of a trainee doctor in Kolkata. Over a million medical professionals participated, severely impacting healthcare services.

The victim, a 31-year-old, was attacked inside her workplace, RG Kar Medical College. This incident echoes the 2012 Delhi bus gang-rape, sparking widespread outrage.

Hospitals continued to handle emergencies, but elective procedures and outpatient consultations were halted. The Indian Medical Association (IMA) supported the strike, emphasizing the need for safety for women in the profession.

Protests extended beyond doctors, with thousands marching in cities demanding justice and improved security in medical facilities. Political leaders and celebrities joined the call for stricter punishments for such crimes.

The strike follows a pattern of rising sexual violence in India. In 2022, rape reports surged by 20% from the previous year, totaling 31,516 cases.

This action underscores a deep-seated demand for justice and systemic changes to protect women, highlighting the persistent challenges in addressing gender-based violence in India.
