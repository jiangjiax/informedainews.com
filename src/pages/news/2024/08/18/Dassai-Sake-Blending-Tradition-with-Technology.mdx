Asahi Shuzo, Japan’s top sake exporter, blends tradition with technology. Based in Iwakuni, their brewery uses data to refine the brewing process. Each morning, CEO Kazuhiro Sakurai and team taste the previous day’s pressings, adjusting based on production data.

Hand-soaking rice and manual koji yeast preparation maintain quality. Data, collected throughout production, aids in identifying issues and enhancing taste. This approach ensures consistent, high-quality sake.

Exports surged during COVID-19, reaching 6.9 billion yen in 2021. Asahi Shuzo plans to increase overseas revenue to 90% in the long term. They’ve established a New York brewery and introduced the Dassai Blue brand, using data to adapt to local conditions.

**Explanation of Terms:**
- **Koji yeast:** A fungus used in fermenting rice to produce sake.
- **Sake:** A Japanese alcoholic beverage made from fermented rice.
