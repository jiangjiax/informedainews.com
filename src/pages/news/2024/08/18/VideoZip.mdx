VideoZip simplifies online video tasks by compressing, converting formats, extracting audio, and adding watermarksâ€”all for free, with no downloads or sign-ups required. Processing occurs locally, ensuring privacy and speed, making it ideal for creators and marketers.

**Compression**: Reducing the size of a video file without significantly compromising its quality.
**Format Conversion**: Changing a video from one file type to another, such as MP4 to AVI.
**Audio Extraction**: Isolating the audio component from a video file.
**Watermarking**: Adding a visible logo or text to a video to claim ownership or prevent unauthorized use.
