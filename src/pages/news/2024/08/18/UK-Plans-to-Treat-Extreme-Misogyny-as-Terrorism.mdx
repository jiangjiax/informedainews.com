Extreme misogyny, a new form of terrorism, is being targeted under UK plans. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is reviewing counter-terrorism strategies with a focus on violence against women and girls.

Teachers are required to report suspected extreme misogyny to Prevent, the UK's counter-terrorism program. Cooper highlights the increase in online and street extremism and the urgency for action.

The review seeks to identify policy gaps and effective disruption methods, with an expected completion in the autumn. A new counter-extremism strategy will follow.

The "Incel" subculture, which is misogynistic online, blames women for their lack of sexual opportunities. Deputy Chief Constable Maggie Blyth links online influencers like Andrew Tate to radicalization. Tate is facing trial in Romania on allegations of rape and human trafficking.

Prevent workers have observed an increase in school referrals influenced by Tate's teachings. His toxic misogyny closely aligns with incel ideology.
