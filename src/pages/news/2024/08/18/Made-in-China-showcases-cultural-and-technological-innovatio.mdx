The pin culture of the Olympics has a long and storied history. Since the 1896 Athens Olympics, pins have evolved from simple identity markers into symbols of Olympic culture. By the 1924 Paris Olympics, badge swapping had become a tradition. Today, pins are not only souvenirs but also conveyors of culture and friendship.

Pins made in China have shined brightly at the Paris Olympics. The pins designed for the Chinese delegation are exquisite and of high quality,深受 athletes'喜爱. In fact, most Olympic souvenirs, including mascots and bracelets, are produced in China, particularly in Yiwu, Zhejiang.

Chinese innovation also has a significant presence in the Olympics. Products like Red Double Happiness's table tennis tables, Taishan Sports' high-tech mats, and SenseTime's AI broadcasting solutions showcase China's innovative capabilities.

The relay of the Olympics is not only a continuation of sports competition but also a display of Chinese manufacturing and innovation on the global stage.
