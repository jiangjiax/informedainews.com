Overseas venture capital funds have increased their investment in Japanese startups by nearly 70% in the first half of 2024. Total foreign VC investment reached 22.5 billion yen ($152 million), accounting for about 20% of Japan's VC funding. This surge exceeded the overall 4% growth in Japanese VC investments.

Geopolitical tensions are driving funds away from China. The U.S. has imposed restrictions on investments in AI and chip technologies in China, and China is strengthening corporate controls. Meanwhile, Japan is gaining attention due to its supportive government policies and emerging deep tech companies.

Startups such as Zehitomo, Sakana AI, Renalys Pharma, and EneCoat Technologies have all secured significant overseas funding. The Japanese government is also investing in global VC funds to promote growth in local startups.

This shift towards Japan could stabilize share prices and support long-term growth for these companies.
