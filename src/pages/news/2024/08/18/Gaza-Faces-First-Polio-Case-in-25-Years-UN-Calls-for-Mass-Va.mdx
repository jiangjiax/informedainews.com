Gaza's first polio case in 25 years has emerged in a 10-month-old child. The UN has called for war pauses to vaccinate over 640,000 children. Polio, which spreads through sewage, causes paralysis and can be fatal, mainly affecting kids under five.

The UN plans two seven-day vaccination drives starting late August. These require ceasefires to ensure safe access to health facilities. Over 1.6 million vaccine doses are set to arrive via Israel's Ben Gurion airport.

The re-emergence of polio threatens neighboring countries. A ceasefire is crucial for regional public health security. The Gaza health ministry and UN agencies aim to administer two drops of the novel oral polio vaccine type 2 to children under ten.

The war, ongoing for 11 months, escalated after Hamas's attack on Israel in October, leading to thousands of deaths. Israel's retaliatory campaign in Gaza has claimed over 40,000 lives.
