Luis Elizondo, a former Pentagon official, claims in his memoir "Imminent" that a secret program has been collecting nonhuman technology and biological remains for decades. He warns that these could pose a threat to national security or even humanity itself. Elizondo's revelations in 2017 sparked congressional interest, leading to a 2023 hearing where a former official confirmed the retrieval of nonhuman objects. His book details a covert operation involving government and defense contractors. Published by HarperCollins, it underwent a Pentagon security review.
