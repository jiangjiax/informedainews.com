Starting September, Taiwan enforces several new policies across various sectors. Notably, all beverage shops must stop using disposable plastic cups, a move expected to reduce 7.9 billion such cups annually. This initiative began in Taipei and has now spread nationwide.

In healthcare, the government has renamed "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome" to "COVID-19 Severe Cases" and adjusted the reporting timeframe to within a week. Additionally, 46 types of robotic-assisted surgeries are now covered by health insurance, including procedures like hysterectomies and gallbladder removals.

For passport renewals, adults with digital certificates can now apply online, provided their passport is expired and they meet other specific criteria.

In public health, Taipei has banned smoking in outdoor areas of major public facilities and five social housing projects, with fines up to $10,000 for violations. The city also extends free HPV vaccinations to male students.

Lastly, New Taipei City has eased childcare policies, allowing parents on parental leave to access public daycare without needing proof of return to work.
