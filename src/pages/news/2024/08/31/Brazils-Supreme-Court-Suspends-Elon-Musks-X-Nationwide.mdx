Brazil's top court ordered a nationwide suspension of Elon Musk's social network X. The suspension follows X's refusal to comply with court orders regarding content moderation and the appointment of a legal representative in Brazil. Judge Alexandre de Moraes imposed daily fines on those using VPNs to access X during the ban.

The court initially ordered Apple and Google to stop offering X downloads and VPN apps, but later suspended this directive. X had no legal representative in Brazil, despite legal requirements for social media companies to handle government takedown notices.

Brazil's population of over 171 million active social media users could impact X's business. Musk's acquisition of Twitter in 2022 led to significant changes, including the reinstatement of banned accounts, prompting major advertisers to withdraw.

Musk criticized de Moraes, comparing him to a movie villain and accusing him of censorship. The court's history includes suspending other social media apps like WhatsApp and Telegram until they complied with regulations.
