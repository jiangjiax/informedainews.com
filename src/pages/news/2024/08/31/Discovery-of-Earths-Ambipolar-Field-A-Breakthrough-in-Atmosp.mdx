Scientists have detected Earth's ambipolar field, a weak electric field, for the first time. This field, theorized 60 years ago, exists in the ionosphere at an altitude of 250 kilometers. It balances charged particles, maintaining the cohesion of electrons and ions. This equilibrium expands the atmosphere, enabling some ions to escape into space, a phenomenon known as polar wind.

The field is extremely weak, measured at only 0.55 volts. However, it influences hydrogen ions 10.6 times more than gravity, propelling them into space at supersonic speeds. Oxygen ions, being heavier, are also affected, resulting in a 271 percent increase in the thickness of the ionosphere.

These findings, published in Nature, provide new insights into the dynamics of planetary atmospheres.
