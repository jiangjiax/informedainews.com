The Chinese Football Association has selected Xiamen to host the third stage of the 2026 World Cup Asian Qualifiers, with the Chinese national team facing Japan at home. The match is scheduled for November 19 at the Xiamen Egret Sports Stadium.

The choice of Xiamen was made considering the climate and social benefits. Northern China experiences low temperatures in November, while the south is more suitable. The Xiamen Egret Sports Stadium has a large capacity, which is conducive to creating a home atmosphere.
