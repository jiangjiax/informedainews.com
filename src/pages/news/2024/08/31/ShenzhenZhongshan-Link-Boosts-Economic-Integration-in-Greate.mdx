The Shenzhen-Zhongshan Link, a 24-kilometer bridge-tunnel, opened in June. It significantly reduces travel time between Shenzhen and Zhongshan to just 30 minutes. The 46 billion yuan project recorded over 3 million vehicle crossings in its first month.

This infrastructure is part of President Xi Jinping’s plan to unite cities in the Pearl River Delta, creating a Greater Bay Area. Shenzhen, a tech hub, and Zhongshan, a less developed city, are set to economically benefit from this connection.

Shenzhen companies, such as drone manufacturer SMD UAV, are considering Zhongshan for expansion due to lower production costs and faster transport. Despite high real estate prices and wages in Shenzhen, the bridge provides a strategic advantage.

The bridge’s success is evident from the rapid influx of over 100 business delegations visiting Zhongshan since its opening. It marks a clear step towards economic integration and growth in the region.
