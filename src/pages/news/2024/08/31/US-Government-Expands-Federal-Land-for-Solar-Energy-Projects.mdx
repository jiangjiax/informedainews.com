Biden's team plans to open 31 million acres of federal land for solar projects, expanding from 22 million acres and including five new states. The goal is to place solar farms near transmission lines, avoiding protected areas and wildlife habitats. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has already permitted 29 GW of clean energy projects, enough to power 12 million homes. The aim is to achieve 100% clean electricity by 2035.
