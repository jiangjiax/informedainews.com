China's Belt and Road Initiative, despite setbacks, gains momentum through green energy. Electric vehicles, solar panels, and wind turbines from China dominate global markets. The European Union's concerns over Chinese EV dominance led to tariffs. China's renewable energy sector, bolstered by a large domestic market and government support, sees renewables accounting for 50% of power generation capacity. International scrutiny over China's emissions reduction pace intensifies, yet China's influence in decarbonization strategies worldwide grows.
