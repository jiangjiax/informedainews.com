Electroencephalography (EEG) technology, with a century-long history, originated from experiments by German psychiatrist Hans Berger. EEG collects brain waves through electrodes placed on the head to analyze brain activity. Today, EEG is used for diagnosing diseases, exploring consciousness, and even controlling external devices.

In the future, EEG may become a routine tool for sleep monitoring and enter the consumer market, such as being integrated into everyday caps connected to smartphones. Clinically, EEG could become a primary communication tool for patients with paralysis or consciousness disorders.

More forward-looking applications include reading thoughts, memories, and dreams, which, though distant, are not science fiction. Artificial intelligence will help extract more information from EEG data, converting thoughts into text.

However, the advancements in EEG also raise privacy issues. While brain data does not represent thoughts themselves, it can infer ideas and feelings. The use of such devices involves data sharing, presenting ethical and legal challenges.

Professor Pedro Valdes-Sosa is optimistic about the future of EEG, believing its low cost and portability make it potentially valuable in global health monitoring. The development of EEG is not just a technological advancement but also a profound exploration of human thoughts and privacy.
