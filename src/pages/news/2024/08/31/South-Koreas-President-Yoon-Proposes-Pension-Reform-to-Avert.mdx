South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol aims to revamp the national pension system, which faces depletion by 2055 due to a plunging birth rate and an aging population. The pension fund is projected to start running deficits by 2041, exhausting its reserves by 2055.

Yoon proposes automatic stabilization mechanisms to adjust benefits based on inflation and contributor numbers. This approach mirrors systems in Japan and Finland. Currently, 22 million South Koreans contribute to the pension fund, with four contributors for every beneficiary. This ratio is expected to nearly equalize by 2050.

The plan includes raising basic pension payments and gradually increasing premiums, with slower hikes for younger contributors. However, with opposition parties dominating the National Assembly, reaching a consensus may prove challenging.

**Key Terms:**
- **Total fertility rate:** Average number of children born per woman.
- **Macroeconomic slide:** A mechanism to adjust pension benefits based on economic factors.
- **OECD:** Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, an international organization that provides data and analysis on economic and social issues.
