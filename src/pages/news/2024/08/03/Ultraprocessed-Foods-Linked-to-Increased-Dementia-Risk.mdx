Eating processed red meat, such as hot dogs and bacon, twice a week can increase the risk of dementia by 14%. This conclusion is drawn from a study that tracked 130,000 U.S. adults over 43 years. Unprocessed red meat, like steak, did not significantly raise the risk. However, consuming it daily resulted in greater self-reported cognitive decline.

Ultraprocessed foods, which are high in daily calories, are associated with faster cognitive decline, particularly in executive functions. A Brazilian study supports this, involving over 10,000 middle-aged adults.

Executive functioning refers to higher-order cognitive skills, such as planning and problem-solving.
