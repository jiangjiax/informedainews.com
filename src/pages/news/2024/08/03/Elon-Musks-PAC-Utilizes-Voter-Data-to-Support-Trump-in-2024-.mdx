Elon Musk's America PAC is using voter data to boost Trump's 2024 campaign against Harris. The PAC, backed by Musk's billions and social media influence, targets battleground states with digital ads. These ads entice voters with promises of registration assistance, but instead collect personal data.

In non-competitive states, users are directed to actual registration pages. In battleground states, they encounter detailed data collection forms, only to land on a "thank you" page, unregistered but with abundant data collected.

The PAC's strategy includes door-to-door canvassing, informed by the collected data. This tactic, considered a person-to-person exchange, allows legal coordination with the Trump campaign.

Since June, America PAC has spent over $21 million on various campaign activities. The group's recent leadership shake-up suggests potential strategy changes as November approaches.

Musk's involvement, combined with his tech empire, positions him as a significant player in this election. His PAC's tactics highlight a sophisticated mix of technology and traditional campaigning, aiming to influence the electoral landscape in Trump's favor.
