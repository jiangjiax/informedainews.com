China's wind and solar power capacities now surpass that of coal. By 2026, solar power alone will take the lead, boasting a capacity of 1.38 TW, which is 150 GW more than coal. Since 2020, additions in wind and solar have tripled those of coal. Last year, 293 GW of renewable energy was installed.

Additions in coal capacity dropped from 40 GW to 8 GW in early 2024. Government policies are curbing new coal projects to achieve carbon reduction goals. Smaller coal plants are being phased out, while existing ones are being upgraded to reduce emissions.

The disparity between coal and clean energy additions expanded to 16 times in 2024.
