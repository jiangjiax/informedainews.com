Google's Chrome is becoming more intelligent with the introduction of three new AI-powered features:

1. Google Lens integrated into the address bar allows you to search for content directly from what you see on your screen.
2. You can now query your browsing history using natural language, such as asking for information on an ice cream shop.
3. Tab Compare assists in comparing products across multiple open tabs by displaying detailed information and reviews.

These enhancements are designed to streamline and improve the efficiency of your web browsing experience.
