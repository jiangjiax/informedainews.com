Apple's Q3 2024 earnings exceeded expectations. Revenue reached $85.78 billion, a 4.9% increase from the previous year. iPhone sales declined by 0.9% to $39.30 billion, less than anticipated. Sales in China fell by 6.5% to $14.73 billion, a worse decline than forecasted. Apple's emphasis on AI features, announced at WWDC, is expected to enhance future sales.
