Kamala Harris secured the Democratic nomination for president, making history as the first Black woman and South Asian to lead a major party ticket. Jaime Harrison, chair of the Democratic National Committee, confirmed her majority of delegate votes. Harris will officially accept the nomination at the party's convention in Chicago from August 19 to 22.

Joe Biden, who initially held the presumptive nomination, ended his bid following a poor debate performance. He endorsed Harris, calling her selection as his vice-president "one of the best decisions Iâ€™ve made."

Harris's campaign raised $310 million last month, with two-thirds from first-time donors. This surge was partly driven by women and young voters.

Republicans nominated Donald Trump for a third term, with JD Vance as his running mate. Harris is expected to announce her own running mate next week, after a rapid vetting process. Potential contenders include governors and senators from various states.

The speed at which the Democratic party rallied behind Harris was described as "unprecedented." The party aims to unite and demonstrate its strength at the upcoming convention.
