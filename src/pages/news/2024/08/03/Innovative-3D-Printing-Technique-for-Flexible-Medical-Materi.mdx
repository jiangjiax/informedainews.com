Scientists at the University of Colorado Boulder have developed a new 3D printing technique, inspired by worm behavior, to create flexible medical materials. This method, called CLEAR, produces a mesh-like substance that mimics the resilience of human tissues.

The innovation lies in its adaptability and strength. Unlike previous materials, this new gel can stretch without breaking, making it ideal for repairing heart tissue or stabilizing spinal discs. It adheres well to organs and can be used for drug delivery or as a stitch-free surgical thread.

This breakthrough addresses a significant challenge in 3D printing: creating materials robust enough for medical use. The team has patented the material and plans to test its compatibility with human tissues.

The implications extend beyond medicine. This technique could enhance material properties in various industries, offering a versatile tool for improving mechanical performance.

The research is detailed in the journal Science.
