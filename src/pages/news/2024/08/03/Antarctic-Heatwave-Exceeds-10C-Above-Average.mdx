Antarctic ice sheets experienced an unusual heatwave, averaging 10°C above normal last month, with some days reaching 28°C hotter than anticipated. Despite the typically sub-zero temperatures, this heatwave is significant.

Michael Dukes, from MetDesk, notes that this aligns with climate models, indicating that polar regions are most affected by human-induced climate change. Continued warming could result in the collapse of ice sheets.
