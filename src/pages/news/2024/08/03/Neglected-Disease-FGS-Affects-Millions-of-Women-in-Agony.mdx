Peninah Kitsao, a Kenyan farmer, endured a year of agony before learning she had female genital schistosomiasis (FGS). This affliction, caused by minuscule parasitic worms in water sources, impacts an estimated 56 million women across sub-Saharan Africa. FGS can lead to organ damage, infertility, and heightened risk of HIV.

Symptoms of FGS closely resemble those of sexually transmitted infections, often resulting in incorrect diagnoses. There is no standardized testing procedure, and only 15,000 women in areas prone to the disease have been tested. A new alliance, the FGS Integration Group (Fig), is working to incorporate FGS treatment into sexual and reproductive health initiatives.

Kitsao's diagnosis was made by a physician trained by LVCT Health, a Kenyan nonprofit organization dedicated to raising awareness about FGS. LVCT discovered that 11% of the women they screened were afflicted with FGS. Gynecologist Victoria Gamba is training medical teams to identify FGS, stressing the importance of precise information and diagnostic methods.

FGS can be treated with praziquantel, a medication that eradicates parasitic worms. However, its efficacy diminishes with delayed detection. The low demand for praziquantel reflects the low rate of diagnoses. Kitsao now collects water with caution, mindful of the potential dangers.

The article underscores the critical need for heightened awareness and standardized testing for FGS to mitigate long-term health consequences and enhance the quality of life for women in affected areas.
