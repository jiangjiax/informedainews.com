Scientists at the University of Bath have discovered a new method to observe hidden energy states in molecules by utilizing light particles. This groundbreaking development, as outlined in a recent study, has the potential to influence various sectors including pharmaceuticals, security, forensics, environmental science, art conservation, and medicine.

The method employs a phenomenon known as "hyper-Raman," wherein two light particles interact with a molecule and merge, altering their color. The resulting color change, when captured, discloses the molecule's energy state. Hyper-Raman outperforms conventional Raman scattering by penetrating deeper into tissues with reduced damage and enhanced image clarity.

A significant finding was the use of chiral light—light with a twist—to unveil the three-dimensional structure of molecules. This was accomplished by positioning molecules on minuscule gold nanospikes, which function as antennas, concentrating light onto the molecules and amplifying the hyper-Raman signal.

This technique could transform the way we analyze pharmaceutical ingredients, detect environmental contaminants, authenticate artwork, and even diagnose diseases by identifying molecular alterations. The research, spanning several decades, highlights the extensive process from theoretical concepts to practical scientific applications.
