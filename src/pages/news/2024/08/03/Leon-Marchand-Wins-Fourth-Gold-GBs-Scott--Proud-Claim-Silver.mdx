France's Leon Marchand clinched his fourth Olympic gold in the 200m medley, besting Britain's Duncan Scott, who took silver. Marchand's victory marks a historic feat, equaling Michael Phelps' record of four individual golds at a single Games.

Earlier, Ben Proud of Team GB secured silver in the 50m freestyle, ending his Olympic medal drought. Proud, a veteran of three Olympics, had previously won global titles but never an Olympic medal until now.

The event was held in Paris, with President Emmanuel Macron among the spectators. The atmosphere was electric, with the crowd roaring as Marchand touched the wall first. His time of 1:54.06 seconds set a new Olympic record, surpassing Phelps' previous mark.

Scott, who also won silver at the World Championships, remains a formidable competitor, earning his sixth career silver and eighth Olympic medal. His performance, while overshadowed by Marchand's brilliance, is a testament to his enduring prowess in the pool.
