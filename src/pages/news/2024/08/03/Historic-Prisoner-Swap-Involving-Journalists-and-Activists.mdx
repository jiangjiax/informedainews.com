Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and ex-Marine Paul Whelan, both unjustly imprisoned in Russia, were released in a multinational prisoner swap. Along with them, Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva and British-Russian activist Vladimir Kara-Murza also gained freedom.

President Biden declared all four had been unjustly imprisoned. The swap involved 24 prisoners, including five Germans and seven Russians, all flown to Turkey. Eight Russians, including spy Vadim Krasikov, were returned to Russia from various countries.

Biden praised the diplomatic feat, noting 16 people were released from Russia, including political prisoners. White House national security advisor Jake Sullivan called the exchange historic, highlighting its complexity and the number of countries involved.

Gershkovich and Whelan, both sentenced to 16 years on espionage charges, were greeted by Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris upon their return to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland.
