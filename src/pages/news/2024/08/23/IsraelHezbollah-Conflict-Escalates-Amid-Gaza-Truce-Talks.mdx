Israel struck Hezbollah in Lebanon after the group fired rockets and drones into Israel, wounding one. The IDF targeted weapons depots and military sites in over ten locations. Hezbollah's attack followed an Israeli strike that killed one and injured 19 in Lebanon.

US President Biden urged Israeli PM Netanyahu to finalize a Gaza truce and release hostages. Talks in Cairo aim to resolve remaining issues. Israel insists on achieving war objectives, including ensuring Gaza poses no future threat.

In Gaza, Israeli airstrikes killed at least 50 Palestinians. The military hit tunnels and launch sites, seizing weapons. Since October, over 40,000 Palestinians have died in the conflict. The war started when Hamas attacked Israel, killing around 1,200 and abducting 250.
