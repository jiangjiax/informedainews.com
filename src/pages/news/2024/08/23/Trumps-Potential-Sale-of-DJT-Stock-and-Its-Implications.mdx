Donald Trump holds 59% of Trump Media, valued at over $2.6 billion. He is restricted from selling until September 25 due to a lock-up agreement, a common practice in IPOs that prevents immediate insider sales following a public listing, aiming for stock stability.

Trump Media merged with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) and went public on Nasdaq as DJT. The lock-up period could end early if DJT remains above $12 for 20 days within a 30-day period.

Selling his shares could pose challenges. A sudden influx of Trump's shares into the market might deter buyers and depress the price. Trump Media has cautioned that this could occur.

If Trump sells, he must report to the SEC within two days, a deadline many insiders often miss.

Cashing out could assist Trump with substantial legal expenses but might negatively impact Trump Media's stock, which is closely linked to his popularity and electoral prospects.

Trump Media's stock has experienced significant volatility. It has declined 71% from its peak, despite its high market capitalization not aligning with its low revenue. Experts view it as a wager on Trump's potential victory in the presidency.
