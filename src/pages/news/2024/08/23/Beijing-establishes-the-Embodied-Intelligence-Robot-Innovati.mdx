Beijing plans to establish itself as a global hub for the robotics industry and build an Embodied Intelligent Robotics Innovation Center. The goals include promoting precision component machining, opening up application scenarios, implementing new product projects, and demonstrating application scenario projects. The Beijing Humanoid Robotics Innovation Center will create the world's first universal robotics hardware and software base platform. By 2026, the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area aims to achieve mass production of 10,000 units of embodied intelligent robots.
