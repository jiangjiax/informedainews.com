Alex, Neuralink's second human recipient, utilizes a brain chip to play Counter-Strike 2 and design in CAD software. He received the chip following a spinal cord injury. Previously, Alex relied on a QuadStick, a mouth-operated controller, which constrained his in-game actions. Now, with Neuralink, he can aim and move simultaneously.

Neuralink encountered issues with the first patient, Arbaugh, where 85% of the electrodes were displaced. They refined the implant process for Alex, noting no thread retraction. Neuralink is focused on enhancing the chip's functionality, with plans to enable full mouse and game controller capabilities, as well as control of robotic arms or wheelchairs.
