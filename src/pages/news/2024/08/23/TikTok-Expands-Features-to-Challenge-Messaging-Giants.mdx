TikTok has rolled out group chats and custom stickers, aiming to deepen user engagement and challenge messaging giants like WhatsApp and iMessage. Users can now form groups of up to 32, chat, share videos, and create personalized stickers without leaving the app.

This move positions TikTok as more than just an entertainment platform, pushing it towards a comprehensive social media hub. The integration of group chats and stickers enhances the app's social and interactive features, potentially reducing reliance on external messaging apps.

With over 15.6 billion global monthly users, TikTok's expansion into messaging could significantly impact the market, especially among younger demographics who already spend considerable time on the platform. This shift not only boosts user retention but also opens new avenues for content creators and e-commerce within the TikTok ecosystem.

TikTok's strategy mirrors the evolution of WeChat in China, hinting at its ambition to become a "super app" in the U.S., offering a blend of social, entertainment, and commercial services.
