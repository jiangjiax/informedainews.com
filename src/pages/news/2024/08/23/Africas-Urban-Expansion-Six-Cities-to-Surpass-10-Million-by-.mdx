Africa's cities are expanding rapidly. By 2035, six cities will surpass 10 million inhabitants. Luanda and Dar es Salaam will join Cairo, Kinshasa, Lagos, and Greater Johannesburg. The youth population is driving this growth. However, challenges are imminent: overcrowding, informal settlements, and high unemployment. Public services are under strain, and climate change poses a threat. The urban population is expected to approach 1 billion. East Africa is leading in growth, with potential megalopolises emerging. Africa's population is projected to nearly double to 2.2 billion within 30 years, with the majority being under 30.
