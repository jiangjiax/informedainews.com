Gold prices surged to a record $2,531.60 per ounce. Analysts predict further gains, attributing the rise to geopolitical tensions and inflation. UBS forecasts gold to reach $2,700 by mid-2025, while David Neuhauser anticipates it could hit $3,000 within three years.

Shares of gold mining companies have also climbed, with the VanEck Gold Miners ETF hitting its highest level since April 2022. Wolfe Research indicates that the ETF is not overbought and advises purchasing shares of Royal Gold and Newmont Corporation.

Gold demand remains robust, particularly in China and India. Central banks are continuing to acquire gold, with annual purchases projected to hit 800 tons in 2024.

Investors are also eyeing junior gold miners, which specialize in early-stage exploration. Neuhauser suggests investing in Amaroq Minerals, Hochshild Mining, Coeur Mining, and Wesdome.

Gold acts as a safeguard against inflation and market fluctuations. A depreciating dollar enhances gold's appeal to international buyers, further boosting its price.
