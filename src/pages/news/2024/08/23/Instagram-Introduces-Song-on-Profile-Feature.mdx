# Instagram Introduces 'Song on Profile' Feature

Instagram introduces a feature enabling users to attach a song to their profile, echoing the early style of Myspace. The song is displayed in the bio and can be played or paused by viewers. Unlike Myspace, it does not autoplay. Users can select a 30-second clip from a licensed music library.

This update combines nostalgia with contemporary user control, steering clear of the old intrusive autoplay. It's a gentle homage to the past, enriching profile customization without overwhelming visitors.
