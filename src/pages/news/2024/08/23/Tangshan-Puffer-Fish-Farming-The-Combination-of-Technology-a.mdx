Tangshan, known as the "Hometown of Pufferfish in China," is renowned for its cultivation of the red-spotted pufferfish. With an annual production of thousands of tons, it accounts for 90% of the national total. Pufferfish, once banned from consumption due to their toxins, have seen a significant reduction in toxicity, even becoming non-toxic, through scientific farming methods.

Pufferfish farming in Tangshan began in the 1980s, benefiting from the natural conditions of the Bohai Bay and scientific breakthroughs. Aquaculture farms in Caofeidian utilize closed-factory farming and strict quality control to minimize toxin accumulation. New technologies, such as engineered circulating water systems in seawater ponds, further ensure safety.

The pufferfish industry not only exports but also gradually opens up the domestic market. Tangshan enterprises have introduced pre-prepared pufferfish products, simplifying the cooking process and expanding the consumer base. The pufferfish town combines industry with tourism, attracting visitors for an experiential journey.

From a once-risky delicacy to a safe culinary choice, the story of Tangshan is a perfect blend of technology and tradition.
