Disney+ now offers an immersive Iceland environment for Apple Vision Pro users. This marks National Geographic's first venture into such projects for Apple's headset. The setting is Thingvellir National Park, captured in high detail by National Geographic photographers. Disney Studio Technology helped create the 3D models using photogrammetry and gigapixel panoramas. This addition complements other Disney+ immersive scenes like a Theater, Scare Floor, Avengers Tower, and Tatooine.

Photogrammetry: a technique using multiple photos to create 3D models.
Gigapixel panoramas: extremely high-resolution panoramic images.
