National Public Data, a background check firm, suffered a cyber-attack in April. The breach exposed 29 billion personal records, making it the second-largest data leak in history. Leaked details include social security numbers, names, and addresses. The hacker, USDoD, is selling this data on underground forums. Christopher Hofmann has filed a class-action lawsuit against the company, seeking damages and corrective actions.

Background check firms like National Public Data gather personal information from non-public sources to verify identities. This incident underscores the vulnerability of such data and the potential for widespread misuse.
