China is advancing the "Thousand Sail Constellation" project, aiming to deploy 15,000 low-Earth-orbit satellites by 2030 to construct a global network. This move signifies the maturity of satellite networking technology and is expected to drive developments in communications, military, and digital economy sectors. Relevant companies such as Qianzhao Optoelectronics, Sirui New Materials, and Haige Communications are seizing the opportunity to accelerate their commercial space race strategies.

The low-Earth-orbit satellite industry chain is thriving, with listed companies actively responding. For instance, Tongyu Communication has increased its investment in its subsidiary by 80 million yuan to bolster satellite communication business. Aerospace驭星 has completed a financing round of nearly 500 million yuan, indicating a growing market demand for satellite management services.

Analysts are optimistic about the construction of low-Earth-orbit satellite constellations, believing that the market has vast potential and industrialization will rapidly advance. Geely Group, among others, has also invested in low-Earth-orbit satellite internet projects, with a total investment of 4.12 billion yuan.

Low-Earth-orbit satellites: These are satellites operating in low orbits around the Earth, primarily used for communication, navigation, and other purposes.
