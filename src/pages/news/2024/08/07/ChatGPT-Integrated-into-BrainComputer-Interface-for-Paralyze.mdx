Synchron, a leader in brain-computer interfaces (BCI), has integrated ChatGPT into its system. This device, called Synchron Switch, helps paralyzed patients control digital tools without surgery. It enters through the neck vein, connects to the brain's motor cortex, and allows users to operate devices with thoughts.

This tech is a game-changer for those with conditions like ALS or stroke, enabling them to type, shop, and bank online. Mark, an ALS patient, now communicates more efficiently with just a thought. The system costs $50,000-$100,000, comparable to other high-end medical implants.
