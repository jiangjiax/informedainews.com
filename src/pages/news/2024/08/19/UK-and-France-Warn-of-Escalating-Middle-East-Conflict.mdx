Foreign Secretary David Lammy and French counterpart Stéphane Séjourné warn of a rising risk of full-scale regional war in the Middle East. This comes as international efforts intensify to calm tensions with Iran and broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Israel to push for a ceasefire deal. Lammy and Séjourné, in a joint article, highlight a destructive cycle of violence involving Iran and its allies in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen. They stress the need for restraint and diplomacy to prevent a broader conflict.

An Israeli airstrike in Lebanon killed at least 10 Syrian nationals, escalating tensions with Hezbollah. Israel claims it targeted a Hezbollah weapons depot. Hezbollah and Iran’s allies vow to cease attacks once the Gaza war ends.

Lammy and Séjourné’s intervention signals a growing UK-France cooperation. They emphasize the importance of a ceasefire deal for Israelis, Palestinians, and the region. Their stance aligns with Blinken’s mission to secure a ceasefire and release hostages from Gaza.

Ceasefire talks in Doha ended without a breakthrough, with Hamas dismissing optimism from international mediators. Negotiations continue in Cairo, but significant gaps remain, including Israeli troop presence on the Gaza-Egypt border and the sequencing of a hostage release.

The Palestinian death toll in Gaza surpasses 40,000. Fresh Israeli evacuation orders force 170,000 displaced people to move again, including from previously designated safe zones. Israel’s military announces a new ground operation in Khan Younis.
