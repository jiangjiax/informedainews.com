Couples now blend pop and classical music at weddings, inspired by Netflix's Bridgerton. The show's orchestral pop renditions influence musical choices, ranging from Taylor Swift to Alicia Keys. Jay Émme, a cellist, has noticed a significant increase in requests since Bridgerton, with unique mixes like Earth, Wind & Fire's "September" combined with the bridal march.

Craig Parker, a guitarist, observes a rising demand for acoustic sets featuring violinists. He averages two bookings per week. Both musicians agree that live string performances add sophistication and refresh familiar tunes for ceremonies, although traditional pop remains popular later in the event.

Rachael Armstrong selected a violin rendition of Carly Rae Jepsen's "I Really Like You" for her entrance. Guests were surprised, initially mistaking it for classical music until they recognized the tune.

Émme finds joy in adapting pop songs for classical instruments, viewing it as a creative outlet that challenges traditional boundaries. She emphasizes that almost any song can be reimagined using classical instruments, offering a diverse and enjoyable musical experience.
