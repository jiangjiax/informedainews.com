Coldreach utilizes AI to scan job postings, news, LinkedIn, and other sources, identifying potential customers exhibiting buying signals. The tool then creates personalized messages to engage these prospects.

This strategy triples the number of meeting bookings without increasing the number of SDRs. SDRs, or Sales Development Representatives, are salespeople responsible for prospecting and qualifying leads.

The approach is highly efficient, leveraging technology to precisely target and directly approach interested parties.

**Buying signals**: Indications from potential customers that they are ready to make a purchase.
**SDRs (Sales Development Representatives)**: Salespeople dedicated to finding and qualifying potential customers.
