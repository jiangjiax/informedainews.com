FDA approves Traumagel, a quick-acting trauma hemostatic gel made from algae and fungi. Shipped in a Halo-like injector, it stops bleeding in 10 seconds. Ideal for severe wounds like gunshots, it simplifies traditional, painful methods.

Traumagel's ease and speed promise better emergency care, especially crucial in war zones where most deaths are bleeding-related. Cresilon, its maker, eyes broader medical use and a booming global wound care market, estimated at $390 billion by 2030.
