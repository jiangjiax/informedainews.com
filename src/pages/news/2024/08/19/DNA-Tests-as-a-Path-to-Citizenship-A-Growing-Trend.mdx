DNA tests have become a tool for claiming citizenship. Over 40 million people have utilized services such as Ancestry and 23andMe to trace their family origins. Some individuals, like Richard Sayers, use these tests to discover unknown relatives and subsequently apply for citizenship in other countries. Sayers found out he had an Irish father through a DNA test and obtained an Irish passport, allowing him to relocate to Spain.

Professor Turi King anticipates this trend will expand, particularly for Irish citizenship due to historical adoptions and the benefits of EU membership. Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs acknowledges DNA evidence for citizenship claims.

Sarah Claxton, a former Olympic athlete, traced her American father and intends to apply for US citizenship. Legal expert Louisa Ghevaert observes an increase in inquiries regarding amending birth certificates to include biological parents, often driven by citizenship or inheritance motives.

Brexit has underscored the significance of EU citizenship, prompting more Britons to consider dual citizenship options through DNA testing.
