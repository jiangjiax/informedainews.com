Ukrainian forces have advanced deep into Russia's Kursk region, destroying key bridges and targeting infrastructure. Over 5,000 soldiers are involved, claiming control of 82 settlements across 1,150 square kilometers. The strategy aims to disrupt Russian logistics, making it harder for Moscow to support its troops in eastern and southern Ukraine.

Ukraine's air force has notably destroyed two strategic bridges in Kursk, impacting supply routes and evacuation efforts. Additionally, an oil depot in Rostov was hit, further straining Russian military resources.

Russia's response has been criticized as inadequate, with military bloggers and analysts noting the failure to anticipate and effectively counter the incursion. The Institute for the Study of War suggests that Russia will need to commit more resources to regain control, highlighting the challenges ahead.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasizes the goal to diminish "Russian war potential" and establish a buffer zone, aiming to limit future aggression and push towards a peaceful resolution.
