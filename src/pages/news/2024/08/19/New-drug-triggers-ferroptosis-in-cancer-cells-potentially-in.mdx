The team from Bochum University has discovered a new drug that can trigger ferroptosis in cancer cells. Ferroptosis is a form of cell death characterized by the accumulation of lipid peroxides, catalyzed by iron. The team synthesized a cobalt-containing metal complex that accumulates in the mitochondria, producing reactive oxygen species that attack fatty acids, thereby inducing ferroptosis. Studies show that this substance can slow tumor growth, but it currently lacks the ability to selectively target tumor cells, requiring further research and improvement.

Ferroptosis: A form of cell death distinct from apoptosis, characterized by the accumulation of lipid peroxides.

Mitochondria: The energy factories within cells, involved in various cellular functions.

Reactive Oxygen Species: Highly reactive oxygen molecules that participate in cellular signaling and damage.
