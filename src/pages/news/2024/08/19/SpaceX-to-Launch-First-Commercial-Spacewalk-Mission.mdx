SpaceX is scheduled to launch its first commercial spacewalk on August 26 from Florida. The mission, aiming for a 1,400-kilometer orbit, is led by Jared Isaacman and named Polaris Dawn.

Isaacman, a billionaire who previously funded a private space flight, is embarking on his second trip. He is joined by Scott Poteet, Anna Menon, and Sarah Gillis for a five-day mission.

On the first day, the focus is on minimizing meteoroid risks. The second day includes over 40 scientific experiments and EVA suit tests. The third day features the spacewalk, led by Isaacman and Gillis.

SpaceX has designed a new EVA suit for this mission, featuring a 3D-printed helmet and advanced textiles. The mission also tests Starlink for reduced communication delays.

Originally planned for 2022, the mission faced multiple delays due to suit design and technical issues. It is now set for a firm launch in a week.
