New research reveals ancient kelp forests off the Pacific coast date back 3200 million years, older than previously thought. These forests supported extinct beaked whales before the arrival of modern sea otters and birds.

Kelp forests are complex ecosystems, vital for numerous marine species. The study uncovered evidence in 3200-year-old kelp holdfast fossils, indicating that kelp sustained ancient marine life, such as the now-extinct double-toothed whale.

This discovery challenges earlier beliefs that kelp forests evolved alongside modern marine fauna around 1400 million years ago. It suggests that kelp was present much earlier, laying the foundation for subsequent ecosystems.

The research, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, utilized X-ray scans to analyze fossils. These scans revealed ancient kelp holdfasts, the root-like structures anchoring kelp to the sea floor, complete with attached shellfish and barnacles.

This study not only extends the timeline of kelp forest existence but also emphasizes the intricate evolution of marine ecosystems. It highlights how life adapts and evolves in the ocean, often in more complex ways than previously understood.
