Coffee prices are on the rise, influenced by adverse weather conditions, shipping delays, and new environmental regulations. Robusta beans reached an all-time high in July, trading above $4,000 per ton, while Arabica beans are not far behind, at over $2 per pound.

Vietnam's coffee production has decreased due to El Nino, exacerbating previous shortages in Brazil. Shipping challenges and the EU's new deforestation regulations have further tightened the market.

Analysts foresee market volatility continuing through 2024, with some relief expected in 2025 as Brazil's harvests improve. However, climate change poses a significant threat to future production and quality.

In Vietnam, irregular rainfall has affected the size of coffee beans, complicating the harvesting and sorting processes. Rising temperatures and an increase in pests are also adding to farmers' difficulties and increasing costs.

The quest for cheaper beans has altered market dynamics, with robusta often driving price movements. Despite potential short-term price drops, structural issues suggest that coffee prices will likely remain higher than before.
