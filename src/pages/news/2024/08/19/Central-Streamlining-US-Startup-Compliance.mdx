Central automates startup compliance in the US. It manages state registrations, worker's compensation, and filings. This automation saves time and prevents fines. Over 100 companies use it.

Traditional HR platforms do not offer this automation. Central simplifies operations, cutting manual work and legal risks. Its strength lies in efficiency and risk reduction.

**Explanation of Terms:**
- **State Registrations:** Legal processes a company must complete to operate in a state, including obtaining necessary permits and licenses.
- **Worker's Compensation:** Insurance that provides wage replacement and medical benefits to employees injured in the course of employment.
- **Filings:** Legal documents and reports that companies must submit to regulatory bodies.
