TOKYO/LONDON — Seven & i Holdings, the operator of 7-Eleven stores, is facing a takeover bid from Canadian convenience store giant Alimentation Couche-Tard. The Japanese company has established a committee to evaluate the proposal, taking into account its valuation and long-term implications.

Seven & i’s market capitalization is currently at 4.6 trillion yen. A complete acquisition by Couche-Tard would surpass 5 trillion yen, making it the largest foreign takeover of a Japanese company.

If approved, the transaction could combine two retail behemoths, creating a global leader in convenience stores with combined sales approaching 20 trillion yen.

Couche-Tard, which operates in over 30 countries, seeks to expand its regional presence and store network. Seven & i, with 85,000 stores worldwide, aims to reach 100,000 by 2030.

Both companies are primarily focused on convenience stores but differ in operational emphasis and corporate culture, which could present challenges in the integration process.
