NVIDIA's market capitalization reached $3 trillion, making it the third largest company behind only Apple and Microsoft. The stock closed at $124.58, with a total value of $30644.61 billion.

Goldman Sachs maintains a "Buy" rating due to strong demand from cloud providers and large enterprises. NVIDIA is a leader in AI and high-performance computing.

Analysts forecast an EPS of $4.16 for 2025, which is 11% higher than estimates. The target price is set at $135. Delays in GPU production have caused minor issues, but earnings appear robust.

Second quarter 2025 results are expected on August 28. Goldman anticipates revenue and EPS to exceed forecasts, at $297.69 billion and $0.68 respectively.
