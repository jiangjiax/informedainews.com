Studio Seufz and AMC Games announce "The Ultimate Tower of Fortune" for a September 13, 2024, Early Access launch on Steam, priced at $14.99. This adventure-comedy game, a sequel to a popular Flash series, offers randomized chaos in each playthrough. Players navigate a procedurally generated tower, facing unique challenges and characters. Success rewards with village upgrades, new hairstyles, and interactions with rescued companions.
