Gene-editing therapy utilizing Crispr technology has been approved for the NHS. It targets beta thalassaemia, a blood disorder. Stem cells are extracted, reprogrammed, and reinserted with the aim of eliminating lifelong blood transfusions.

Beta thalassaemia is a genetic condition that affects haemoglobin production, causing symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath, and reducing life expectancy. Kirthana Balachandran, diagnosed at three months, experiences muscle pain, back pain, and palpitations.

Crispr, a Nobel Prize-winning tool, functions like a satnav and scissors, targeting and editing DNA. The therapy disables the BCL11A switch, restoring fetal haemoglobin production. Stem cells are harvested, sent to a lab, and then reintroduced after chemotherapy.

Abdul-Qadeer Akhtar, a 28-year-old clinical trial participant, describes the treatment as tough but transformative, leading to improved health and increased activity, including taking up boxing. Out of 52 patients, 49 have been transfusion-free for at least a year, although long-term effects are unknown.

The therapy has been approved by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence, with the NHS paying less than Â£1.6 million per patient. It is offered to 460 eligible patients at seven specialist centres. Beta thalassaemia is prevalent among Mediterranean, south Asian, south-east Asian, and Middle Eastern populations.

Vertex's Casgevy is the first Crispr-based therapy. The UK Thalassaemia Society calls it a revolutionary breakthrough and a beacon of hope. Negotiations are underway for a treatment for sickle cell anaemia.
