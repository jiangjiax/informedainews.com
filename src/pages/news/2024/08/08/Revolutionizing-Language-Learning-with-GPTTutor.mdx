GPT-Tutor, a revolutionary AI tool for language learning, customizes study materials according to the user's language proficiency, interests, and specific needs. Unlike traditional methods that often fall short in providing suitable reading material, GPT-Tutor produces relevant and engaging texts.

It designs personalized learning scenarios. For example, if you are a carpenter, it might incorporate situations related to woodworking. This approach not only improves vocabulary retention and usage but also mirrors the natural process of language acquisition.

Users can also create their own "word books" based on daily experiences, making the learning process more relatable and effective. GPT-Tutor can generate reading materials that match your vocabulary level and preferences, ensuring steady progress.

This tool is free, open-source, and widely accessible, with the goal of making high-quality language education available to all. It offers a more efficient and enjoyable learning experience, uniquely tailored for each user.
