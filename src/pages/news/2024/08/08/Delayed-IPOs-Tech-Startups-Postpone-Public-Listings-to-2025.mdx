Investors initially anticipated a strong 2024 IPO market, but it appears to be losing steam. Only four technology IPOs took place this year, in March and April. Broader economic factors, including the impending presidential election and elevated interest rates, indicate that the IPO market may not fully recover until 2025.

This year could still surpass 2023, with several additional public filings anticipated. Klarna and Shein are on the verge, though their IPO schedules remain uncertain.

Several prominent companies have decided against going public this year:

- **Skims**: Kim Kardashianâ€™s brand, valued at $4 billion, is targeting 2025.
- **Chime**: The fintech startup, which saw its valuation increase by 25% in the past six months, is aiming for 2025.
- **CoreWeave**: The AI company, which raised $1.1 billion in May, is planning for 2025.
- **Sword Health**: The virtual physical therapy startup is also planning for 2025.
- **Plaid**: The B2B fintech company has no plans for a 2024 IPO.
- **Figma**: The design unicorn's actions suggest it will not pursue a 2024 IPO.
- **Stripe**: The fintech unicorn, valued at $65 billion, is likely to hold off.
- **Databricks**: The AI cloud platform, which raised $500 million, is eyeing 2025.
- **Canva**: The design startup might delay until 2026.

These companies continue to grow, secure funding, and prepare for more favorable market conditions. The IPO frenzy is merely delayed, not extinguished.
