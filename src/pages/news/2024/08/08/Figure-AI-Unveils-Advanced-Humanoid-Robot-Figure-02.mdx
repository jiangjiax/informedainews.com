Figure AI has unveiled Figure 02, a humanoid robot designed to mimic and surpass human capabilities. Standing at 1.70 meters and weighing 70 kg, it features a modern exoskeleton design and improved wiring for practical use in factories.

Figure 02 boasts 16 degrees of freedom in its hands, enabling human-like dexterity. It's equipped with six RGB cameras for comprehensive vision and uses a custom AI model from OpenAI for advanced interaction and decision-making.

Capable of continuous operation for over 20 hours, Figure 02 is set to replace human labor in tasks like assembly line work at BMW. Beyond factories, Figure AI envisions broader applications in homes and offices.

The company, backed by significant funding from tech giants like Intel and OpenAI, aims to revolutionize labor through versatile humanoid robots. This marks a significant step towards integrating advanced robotics into everyday life.
