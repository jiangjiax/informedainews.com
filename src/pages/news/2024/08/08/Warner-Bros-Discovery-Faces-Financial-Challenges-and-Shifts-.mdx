Warner Bros. Discovery's stock took a hit, sliding about 9% after reporting a $9.1 billion write-down on TV networks. The company also missed revenue estimates, bringing in $9.7 billion instead of the expected $10.07 billion.

The write-down stems from a reevaluation of TV network values, reflecting a shift away from traditional TV as viewers and advertisers move to digital and streaming platforms. CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels noted this shift during the earnings call, emphasizing the company's focus on studios and streaming growth.

CEO David Zaslav acknowledged the changing market conditions for legacy media, aligning the company's values with future prospects. Warner Bros. Discovery is aggressively paying down debt, reducing it by $1.8 billion in the second quarter, leaving $41.4 billion in gross debt and $3.6 billion in cash.

The company faces uncertainties with future sports rights, including a lawsuit against the NBA over media rights. TV network revenue dipped 8% to $5.27 billion, with declines in both distribution and advertising.

In contrast, the streaming business, centered on Max, added 3.6 million subscribers, reaching 103.3 million globally. Streaming advertising revenue surged 99%, driven by increased engagement and subscriber growth. Despite a 5% drop in direct-to-consumer streaming revenue, the platform shows promise with international expansion and ad spending.

Warner Bros. Discovery is also exploring streaming bundles with Disney and Fox, aiming to boost profitability.
