Research from Texas A&M University reveals that reducing folate intake may promote healthy aging. Folate, a B-vitamin commonly found in leafy greens, is crucial for cell growth. Traditional thinking has been that more folate is better, but new findings suggest that moderate reductions in folate intake can enhance metabolic flexibility, particularly beneficial for older adults.

The research team observed improved metabolic flexibility, good maintenance of body weight and fat, and no adverse effects such as anemia in animal models with restricted folate intake. This challenges traditional views and supports personalized dietary advice, emphasizing that folate needs change with age.

Dr. Polymenys, the lead researcher, stresses the need for further study on the mechanisms of folate restriction and to explore safe and effective interventions for promoting healthy aging. He cautions that while new findings have emerged, it is not recommended to completely avoid folate intake, especially for specific groups like children and pregnant women.

This study offers new perspectives on precision nutrition and personalized diets, and also opens new avenues for developing folate-restricting medications tailored for the elderly.
