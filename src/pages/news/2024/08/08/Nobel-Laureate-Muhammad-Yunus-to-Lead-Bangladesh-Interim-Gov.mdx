Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has been appointed as the head of Bangladesh's interim government, succeeding long-time Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who resigned amidst violent protests and fled to India. Yunus, renowned for his pioneering work in microcredit and awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006, was appointed following advocacy by student protest leaders, military officials, and civil society representatives. In response to the protests, which resulted in hundreds of deaths, Yunus urged the nation to maintain peace and avoid violence, referring to Hasina's resignation as the "second Liberation Day."
