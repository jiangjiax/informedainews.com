Stranger Things: The First Shadow, a play based on the Netflix series, is moving from London's West End to Broadway. The show premiered in December 2023 at the Phoenix Theatre, winning acclaim for its technical wizardry and storytelling. Set to open at New York's Marquis Theatre on April 22, 2025, the play delves into events from 1959, two decades before the TV series.

Directed by Stephen Daldry and Justin Martin, and written by Kate Trefry, the narrative explores the early lives of characters like Jim Hopper and Henry Creel in Hawkins High School, Indiana. The London cast, including Oscar Lloyd and Isabella Pappas, received high praise.

The play's technical aspects, designed by veterans of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, promise a visual spectacle. Set designer Miriam Buether's work has already won an Olivier Award.

Tickets for the Broadway run can be registered for via strangerthingsonstage.com, with presale signups closing on September 12. General sales start on September 17. Expect high demand and prices, mirroring the London run's success.
