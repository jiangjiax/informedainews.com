Archaeologists have discovered a 12,000-year-old calendar at the Göbekli Tepe site in Turkey. This discovery traces the earliest human timekeeping wisdom back to 9600 BC, thousands of years before the ancient Greek calendar. The calendar is carved on stone pillars, marking 365 days, and records a comet impact event that occurred around 13,000 years ago, which was of a massive scale and had profound effects. The impact prompted humans to transition from hunting and gathering to settled agriculture, accelerating the evolution of civilization. Göbekli Tepe is one of the oldest known cities, witnessing the birth of the agricultural revolution and the early forms of civilization.
