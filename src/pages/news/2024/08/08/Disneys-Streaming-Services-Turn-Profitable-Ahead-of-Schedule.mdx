Revenue for the entertainment segment climbed 4% to $10.58 billion, fueled by subscription growth and price increases. Traditional TV networks experienced a 7% decline in revenue.

Disney intends to implement further price hikes and is addressing password sharing to enhance profitability. CEO Bob Iger conveyed optimism about the future, anticipating growth by fiscal 2025.

ESPN's revenue grew by 5%, supported by advertising and subscription growth. The advertising market has recovered, especially in digital and streaming sectors.
