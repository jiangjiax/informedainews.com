Researchers have developed a new method to measure gene expression in specific brain areas without surgery. This technique employs a type of MRI known as diffusion MRI to track genetic activity. It represents a significant advancement as it allows scientists to study the brain more directly, without the need for invasive procedures.

Gene expression involves how cells convert genetic information into proteins and other molecules. It is essential for understanding diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. This new method could aid doctors in discovering more effective treatments by precisely identifying where and how genes are active in the brain.

The simplicity of this approach is its greatest strength. It sidesteps the risks and complications associated with invasive procedures, making it safer for patients and more feasible for long-term studies. The potential of this technology is immense, offering the promise of clearer insights into the brain's most intricate functions.
