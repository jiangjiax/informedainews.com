Suntory, a Japanese distiller, aims to dominate the global ready-to-drink (RTD) market by 2030. RTDs include canned cocktails and hard seltzer. CEO Takeshi Niinami sees potential in combining Suntory's strengths in soft drinks and alcohol.

The company plans a $437 million plant in Australia, its first overseas facility producing both soft drinks and RTDs. Suntory Global Spirits, formerly Beam Suntory, leads product development.

Suntory's -196 vodka seltzer, launched in Japan in 2005, now sells in Germany and the U.S. Consumers favor its natural, fruity taste. RTDs, less restricted than beer or whisky, grew 13% annually from 2020 to 2023 and could top $50 billion by 2030.

Suntory acquired U.S. distiller Beam in 2014 for $1.6 trillion, aiming to boost spirits sales. Despite initial resistance, Beam now integrates well, with high participation in Suntory University.

Overseas revenue rose from 25% to 52% of total sales from 2013 to 2023. Suntory ranks second in RTD volume, third in sales. Mark Anthony Brands International leads with White Claw hard seltzers.

Niinami focuses on adapting products to local tastes, aiming for a "gold medal" in RTDs. He plans to pass leadership to Nobuhiro Torii, a great-grandson of Suntory's founder.
