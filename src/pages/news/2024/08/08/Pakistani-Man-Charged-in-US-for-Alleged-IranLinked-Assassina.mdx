A Pakistani man, Asif Merchant, faces charges in the U.S. for plotting to kill American politicians in retaliation for the 2020 drone strike that killed Iranian General Qassim Soleimani. The plot, thwarted by law enforcement, involved recruiting U.S. residents to carry out the assassinations.

Merchant, who allegedly spent time in Iran, was arrested and charged with murder for hire. A federal judge detained him in New York. The Justice Department is aggressively countering Iran's efforts to retaliate against U.S. officials for Soleimani's death.

The intended targets of the plot remain unnamed. Merchant discussed potential targets with an informant, noting the tight security around one. The Iranian government denies involvement, stating their policy is to legally prosecute Soleimani's killers.

No link has been found between Merchant and a recent assassination attempt on former President Trump. Law enforcement intercepted Merchant's plans before any attacks occurred. He also planned to steal documents and organize protests in the U.S.
