Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III has introduced a temporary WWE-themed mode called Slam Deathmatch. This mode, running alongside WWE SummerSlam, features wrestling-style finishing moves on downed opponents. Players use the right joystick to execute maneuvers like chair smashes or Cross Rhodes finishers, while a WWE announcer reacts.

The mode is simple: it's Team Deathmatch on smaller maps, with enemies downed instead of killed, and grenades disabled. Players can't take damage during a finisher but can be interrupted. The chaos and novelty of the mode, combined with the use of WWE superstar skins like Rhea Ripley, make it a refreshing break from typical FPS gameplay.

Slam Deathmatch is available for a limited time, offering a unique blend of wrestling and shooter elements that remind players of Call of Duty's potential for fun and innovation.
