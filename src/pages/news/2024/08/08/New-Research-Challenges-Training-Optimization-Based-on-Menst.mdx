New research from UiT The Arctic University of Norway challenges the idea of optimizing training based on menstrual cycles. The study, part of the FENDURA project, tested female endurance athletes across different menstrual phases. Key findings: no general fitness or performance benefits tied to cycle phases.

Tests included submaximal intervals, a 30-second full-effort ski ergometer, and a maximal treadmill run. Results showed no group-level impact from cycle phases on physical fitness. However, individual variations exist. Some athletes performed better or worse in specific phases, but these patterns aren't universal.

This research suggests a "one-size-fits-all" training approach based on menstrual cycles isn't effective. Instead, individual tracking and adjustments might be necessary. The study also highlights the importance of including women in sports science research, as menstrual cycles don't generally skew results.

The findings underscore the need for more research on what constitutes a "normal" menstrual cycle. Understanding individual experiences and variations is crucial for tailored training and health strategies.
