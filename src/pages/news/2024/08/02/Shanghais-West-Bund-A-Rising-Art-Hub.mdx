Shanghai's West Bund district is now a major art hub, drawing visitors from across China and beyond. This 11-kilometer stretch, once an industrial zone, aims to rival Paris's Rive Gauche or London's South Bank. Lorenz Hebling, head of ShanghART Gallery, sees Shanghai as the city of the 21st century, much like Paris was in the late 19th.

The area boasts four major museums and numerous private galleries, set in modern architecture. Civic spaces host biennales and art fairs, while animation studios and trendy cafes dot the landscape. Parks and riverside promenades connect these venues, with an open-air "art shuttle bus" for convenience.

Highlights include free exhibits at the West Bund Museum and the Long Museum, known for linking ancient and contemporary art. The Power Station of Art (PSA), a converted industrial space, offers vast exhibition areas and a historic smokestack as a landmark. The Start Museum, repurposed from a former railway station, features an antique train and open-air exhibits.

Despite its focus on contemporary art, the district avoids direct criticism of China's state institutions. Instead, it offers a blend of art, history, and modernity, making it a must-visit for art enthusiasts.
