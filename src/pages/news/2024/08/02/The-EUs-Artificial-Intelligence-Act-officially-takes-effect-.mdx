The EU's Artificial Intelligence Act comes into effect, marking the world's first comprehensive regulation of artificial intelligence. It mandates that chatbots inform users of machine interactions and ensures the detectability of synthetic content. Systems threatening users' fundamental rights are prohibited. Non-compliant companies face fines of up to 7% of their annual turnover. Member states must designate supervisory authorities and complete this by 2025. Most rules will take effect in August 2026.

This Act signifies a significant advancement in the EU's regulation of artificial intelligence, emphasizing transparency and user protection, and holds profound implications for the global development of artificial intelligence.
