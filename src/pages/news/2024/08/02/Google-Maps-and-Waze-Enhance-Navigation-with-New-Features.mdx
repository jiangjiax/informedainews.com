Google Maps and Waze, both owned by Google, are receiving updates. These changes are gradually rolling out for Android and iOS devices.

Google Maps now allows iOS and Android users to report traffic incidents. This feature, previously absent on CarPlay, is now included. Users can tap larger icons to share updates about traffic jams or closed lanes. Other drivers can confirm these reports, aiding everyone on the road.

As drivers approach their destination, Google Maps highlights nearby car parks and also illuminates the destination building and entrance on the screen.

Waze, meanwhile, introduces a new camera alert system. It warns users about cameras monitoring speeding, red light violations, and other infractions. This data is sourced from the Waze community.

Waze users can also share real-time traffic information, including the cause of traffic events and road closures.

Android users will soon receive lock screen navigation on Waze, with iOS users getting it in the fall. It remains unclear whether these features will be available on CarPlay.

These updates come after Apple's move to bring Apple Maps to the web.
