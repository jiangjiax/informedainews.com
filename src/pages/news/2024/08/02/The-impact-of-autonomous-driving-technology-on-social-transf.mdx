Technological advancements are accelerating the implementation of autonomous driving, exemplified by Tesla's FSD and Baidu's Luobo Kuaipao Robotaxi. However, issues such as high costs and safety concerns persist.

Historically, the Red Flag Act hindered automobile development, while Germany and the United States encouraged it, shaping modern urban structures. Autonomous driving could echo this history, necessitating new urban planning and infrastructure modifications.

Autonomous vehicles require exclusive road rights to avoid mixing with human-driven vehicles, enhancing efficiency and safety. Cities must be remodeled to provide dedicated lanes for autonomous vehicles, conserving resources and creating new spaces.

The digital realm's responsiveness is equally crucial, requiring the integration of individual vehicle intelligence with network-wide coordination to improve system performance. 5G networks and Starlink technology support network connectivity.

In summary, autonomous driving is not just a technological innovation but a comprehensive transformation of social and economic systems. It necessitates new planning and infrastructure, combined with digital technologies, to achieve an efficient and safe autonomous driving society.
