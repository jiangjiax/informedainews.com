Trump spoke at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, where thousands waited hours to hear him. He outlined his plans for bitcoin should he return to the White House.

Simultaneously, Trump held a closed-door meeting with crypto CEOs, including the Winklevoss twins, Coinbase's legal chief, and Cantor Fitzgerald's CEO. They discussed potential collaboration between the industry and a Trump administration.

The event served as a fundraiser, with top-tier tickets priced at $844,600. Attendees comprised bitcoin miners and industry experts who paid substantial fees for access to Trump and the conference.

Trump's campaign raised $25 million from the crypto sector, a notable sum given the recent bear market and industry turmoil.

Trump was impressed by the industry's collaborative spirit, contrasting it with more cut-throat competition in other fields. This sentiment was shared by conference attendees.

The event also spotlighted unexpected bitcoin supporters, such as musician Billy Ray Cyrus, who expressed interest in writing a song about bitcoin.

Overall, the conference demonstrated the crypto industry's efforts to influence policy and secure political support.
