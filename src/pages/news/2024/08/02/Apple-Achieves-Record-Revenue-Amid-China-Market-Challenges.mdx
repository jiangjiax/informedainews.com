Apple achieved a revenue peak for the June quarter, bringing in $85.8 billion, a 5% increase. However, iPhone sales dipped 1% to $39.3 billion. Services saw a significant surge, growing 14% to $21.2 billion.

The Chinese market presented challenges, with revenue there falling 6.5% to $14.7 billion. Huawei and Vivo pushed Apple out of the top five. Nonetheless, Cook remains optimistic and is in talks with Beijing to introduce AI features soon.

Globally, Apple set new records in over two dozen countries. The upcoming iPhone 16, slated for September, promises AI-driven enhancements. Siri will become more intelligent, and new tools will be introduced for photo editing and text rewriting.

Cook is proceeding with caution, collaborating with regulators to roll out these features globally. The strategy is to initiate in English-speaking countries and gradually expand. Apple aims to move swiftly but is attentive to local regulations.
