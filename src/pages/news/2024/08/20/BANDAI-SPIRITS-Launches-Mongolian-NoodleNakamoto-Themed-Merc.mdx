BANDAI SPIRITS introduces a "Mongolian Hot Soup Noodle Chūmon" themed collection, starting August 20. Inspired by the popular spicy ramen, items include a 45-cm plush pillow, cushions, acrylic stands, keychains, and a quirky shoulder bag.

The collection's visuals were shot at the "Mongolian Hot Soup Noodle Chūmon Main Store," featuring owner "Makoto Shirane." The brand's enthusiastic collaboration ensured high-quality products.

The shoulder bag, though unconventional, resonates with modern workers' quirky tastes.
