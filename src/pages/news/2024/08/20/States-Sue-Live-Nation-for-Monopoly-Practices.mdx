Attorneys general from 39 states, the District of Columbia, and the Department of Justice are suing Live Nation and Ticketmaster, alleging that the companies have monopolized the concert industry, leading to inflated ticket prices and harming artists. The lawsuit seeks treble damages—three times the original amount—under federal anti-monopoly law.

Live Nation, through Ticketmaster, controls over 80% of primary ticketing for major venues. The company manages over 400 artists and promotes about 60% of concerts at major venues. Live Nation owns or controls more than 265 venues in North America.

The Justice Department approved Ticketmaster's merger with Live Nation in 2010, with conditions to prevent harm to competition. However, in 2020, a court extended oversight to 2025 due to Ticketmaster's retaliation against venues using other ticketing companies. The Justice Department now claims that Live Nation has engaged in more anticompetitive activities.

Live Nation plans to fight the allegations in court. The company has not responded to requests for comment.
