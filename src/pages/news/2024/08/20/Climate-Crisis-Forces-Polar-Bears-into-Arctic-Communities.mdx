Polar bears, forced onto land by melting ice, are increasingly approaching Arctic communities. John Ussak, a fisherman in Rankin Inlet, fired 20 warning shots to scare off a bear. Days later, two bears killed a technician in Nunavut.

Experts warn that these encounters will increase as climate change disrupts bear habitats. Andrew Derocher, a biologist, notes that bears are becoming more unpredictable. Sea ice, essential for bear survival, is thinning. Some areas experienced near-record-low ice levels this summer.

Derocher predicts more conflicts between bears and humans. Communities are ill-prepared. Few have polar bear patrols. Discussions often center on sustaining the annual hunt rather than safety.

Garbage attracts bears. Derocher envisions a bleak future: fewer bears as populations decline. But for now, the conflict persists.
