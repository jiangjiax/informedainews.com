Eli Lilly's weight loss drug, tirzepatide, reduced the risk of Type 2 diabetes by 94% in overweight adults with pre-diabetes. The drug, which belongs to a class known as GLP-1s, imitates gut hormones to suppress appetite and manage blood sugar levels. Over a three-year period, patients receiving the highest dose lost 22.9% of their body weight, compared to a loss of 2.1% for those on placebo.

Pre-diabetes impacts more than one-third of Americans and is often reversible through lifestyle modifications. Long-term use of tirzepatide demonstrated consistent weight loss and postponed the onset of diabetes. Even after discontinuing the drug, patients experienced a weight regain but still had an 88% lower risk of diabetes compared to the placebo group.

Side effects were primarily gastrointestinal and ranged from mild to moderate. Eli Lilly intends to publish these results and present them at a medical conference.
