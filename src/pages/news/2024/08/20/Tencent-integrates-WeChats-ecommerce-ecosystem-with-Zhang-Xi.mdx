Tencent's recent financial report shows that the company's total revenue reached 161.1 billion yuan, an 8% increase year-on-year. Gross profit was 85.9 billion yuan, a 21% rise. Net profit for the period was 58.4 billion yuan, a 51% increase. All business segments achieved growth, with particularly strong performances in online advertising and domestic market gaming.

Tencent President Martin Lau revealed that the company is integrating e-commerce projects within the WeChat ecosystem, led by Zhang小龙, to build a systematic WeChat e-commerce ecosystem. This move aims to leverage WeChat's traffic and user advantages to challenge e-commerce giants such as Alibaba and JD.com.

Zhang小龙, known as the "father of WeChat," has a remarkable track record within Tencent. He successfully created WeChat and launched the video account in the short video field, which directly challenged Douyin. His strategies are always based on user value, rather than simply imitating competitors.

Tencent has a solid foundation in social and gaming areas, and a breakthrough in the e-commerce sector will further enhance its market-leading position. As the internet industry enters the era of stock competition, Tencent's strategic move could reshape the e-commerce landscape.
