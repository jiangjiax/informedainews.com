The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has sparked a $133 billion boom in clean energy and electric vehicle manufacturing since August 2022. This surge, a 305% increase from pre-IRA levels, has channeled $89 billion into actual manufacturing. The IRA's impact goes beyond clean tech, leveraging half a trillion dollars across manufacturing, energy, and retail sectors.

Trevor Houser, a partner at Rhodium Group, notes that this manufacturing upswing is unprecedented, largely driven by new clean energy facilities. The IRA's 271 announced projects promise over 100,000 jobs, mostly in rural areas. Renewable energy deployment has seen $108 billion in utility-scale solar and battery storage investments, up 56% and 130% respectively.

However, the future of these investments hangs in the balance with the upcoming presidential election. Trump's threats to dismantle the IRA, favoring oil, gas, and coal, have unsettled investors. Clean energy stocks fell after Biden's poor debate performance, reflecting investor fears of a Republican sweep.

Despite Trump's rhetoric, 85% of IRA investments target Republican districts, suggesting potential bipartisan support for clean energy tax credits and manufacturing incentives. The political dynamics shift with Biden out and Harris leading, but the industry braces for policy uncertainty.
