South Sudan teeters on the brink. A UN outpost in Abiemnom, surrounded by chaosâ€”Sudan's war, Abyei's violence, Warrap's raids, Unity's militias. 72 peacekeepers hold the line.

Elections loom, a first since independence. The vote, meant to cement peace, stirs anxiety. Preparations lag. UN's Nicholas Haysom warns of a flawed election sparking renewed conflict.

South Sudan, already strained by food shortages and refugee influx, faces economic collapse. An oil pipeline rupture in Sudan threatens further instability.

Haysom, overseeing 14,000 peacekeepers, seeks more troops. He fears a second civil war would be catastrophic.

The election's format remains unclear. Donors hesitate, seeking assurance of a fair process. The population, armed and anxious, awaits clarity.

UN troops are spread thin, with more bases needed. The populace yearns for democracy, despite doubts about the election's integrity.

In this fragile state, every misstep could reignite widespread violence. The stakes are high, the path uncertain.
