"Black Myth: WuKong," first revealed in 2020, after four years of development, finally launched in the summer of 2024. This game, based on the classic Chinese novel "Journey to the West," quickly became a global sensation, achieving nearly $400 million in sales and selling 1.2 million copies, setting a new record for domestic games.

Game Science, originally founded by members of Tencent's Luminous Studio, learned from the failure of "Fight God," and pivoted to independently develop "Black Myth: WuKong." The game utilizes the Unreal Engine 5 and incorporates Chinese cultural elements, such as continuing to refer to "dragon" as "Long" instead of the Western "Dragon."

Despite facing financial and market challenges, Game Science maintained a clear-headed approach, pricing the game at 268 RMB, lower than expected. This strategy aimed to attract more players and cultivate the market. The results exceeded expectations, with global media averaging a score of 82, IGN China awarding a perfect score, and topping Steam sales worldwide.

"Black Myth: WuKong" is not just a game; it is also a symbol of China's gaming industry advancing towards AAA-level productions. It demonstrates China's capability to produce world-class games while preserving and disseminating its native culture.
