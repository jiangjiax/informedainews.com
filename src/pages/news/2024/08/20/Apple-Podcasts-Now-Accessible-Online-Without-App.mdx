Apple now streams podcasts online without the need for an app. Users can access them through browsers such as Safari. Features include browsing, library access, top charts, and premium subscriptions.

This move benefits PC and Android users, although Apple devices still default to the Podcasts app.

Sharing podcasts has become easier, and creators can reach a broader audience.

Apple's strategy includes embeddable podcast links, enhancing accessibility.
