Criminals sell sextortion guides online on platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Telegram. These guides teach how to trick teens into sending intimate photos and then demand money, threatening to share the photos.

A National Crime Agency manager, Adam Priestley, noted that YouTube guides detail every step, from creating fake accounts to targeting victims and profiting. Some guides even instruct targeting secondary schools.

A cybersecurity firm found an 80-page guide on Telegram, offering detailed advice on creating fake profiles, manipulating victims, and choosing the best countries for extortion. The author claims to have exploited 5,000 victims over seven years.

YouTube, TikTok, and Telegram all claim to take strict measures against such content, but the guides remain accessible. This indicates a growing, professionalized crime, with potential for significant profit.
