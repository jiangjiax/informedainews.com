Heat-related deaths in Europe could triple by 2100, with southern countries like Italy, Greece, and Spain bearing the brunt. Currently, cold kills more people, but heat-related deaths are rising faster as populations age.

If global warming reaches 3°C or 4°C, heat-related deaths could surpass those from cold. This could strain public health systems, particularly during heatwaves.

Currently, 44,000 people die from heat each year. This number could jump to 129,000 at 3°C above pre-industrial levels. Even if warming remains at 1.5°C, total deaths from heat and cold could rise from 407,000 to 450,000 by 2100.

The study challenges the notion that fewer cold deaths balance out more heat deaths. It warns of indirect impacts such as crop failures, wildfires, and economic losses.

Heat will increase deaths across Europe, but southern regions will suffer the most. At 3°C warming, an additional 55,000 could die, mostly those over 85.

Predicting temperature-related deaths is complex. Improvements in healthcare and infrastructure might mitigate impacts. However, adapting to rising heat is crucial.

Governments should invest in hospitals, develop action plans, and insulate buildings. Addressing greenhouse gas emissions is key to avoiding worst-case scenarios.

Adaptation efforts should focus on regions with high unemployment, poverty, and aging populations. These areas are more vulnerable to climate impacts.
