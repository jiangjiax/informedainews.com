McDonald’s plans to open 200 new restaurants in the UK and Ireland by 2028, creating 24,000 jobs. This expansion, supported by a £1 billion investment, will focus on high street locations. McDonald’s intends to experiment with new formats, including smaller sites and drive-thru restaurants. The UK food-to-go market is expected to grow by 40% by 2028. Despite global challenges, McDonald’s remains dedicated to growth. The company faces significant competition, particularly from Greggs, which has surpassed McDonald’s in takeaway breakfast sales.
