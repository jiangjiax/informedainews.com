Researchers at the University of Manitoba, in partnership with the Opaskwayak Cree Nation (OCN), are developing vegetables with enhanced nutritional benefits to combat diabetes. The project utilizes a vertical 'smart farm' established in 2016, which grows plants hydroponically under controlled conditions with LED lights and artificial intelligence.

Initially, the farm provided free vegetables to OCN families through local health programs, aiming to promote healthier diets. Currently, the focus is on research. The team has discovered methods to increase antioxidant compounds in vegetables such as cabbage, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts, which could aid in managing obesity, blood glucose, inflammation, and heart function.

These vegetables are being tested on diabetic and obese rats, with early results indicating higher levels of beneficial compounds compared to store-bought produce. The challenge now is to encourage community members to incorporate these vegetables into their diets, especially since fresh produce is not a regular part of their diet.

To address this, the team is collaborating with chefs at Red River College Polytechnic's Prairie Research Kitchen to develop culturally-sensitive recipes that make the vegetables more accessible and appealing.
