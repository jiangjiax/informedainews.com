Global chip market surged 18.3% in Q2, driven by AI and advanced tech. TSMC's revenue soared, with GPUs leading the charge. Samsung and SK Hynix saw memory sales triple. Demand for DRAM and NAND memory is rising, fueled by data centers.

Smartphones and PCs are recovering, but slowly. Legacy chips and silicon wafers are lagging, facing a prolonged downturn. Renesas and Shin-Etsu Chemical struggle with weak demand.

Chipmaking equipment sales are up, thanks to investments in advanced semiconductors. SEMI forecasts a record year for production equipment. However, legacy sectors remain pessimistic.

Generative AI is creeping into devices, potentially shortening replacement cycles. TSMC and Murata expect a demand uptick in 2024-2025. The divide between advanced and legacy tech is stark, with the former thriving and the latter fading.
