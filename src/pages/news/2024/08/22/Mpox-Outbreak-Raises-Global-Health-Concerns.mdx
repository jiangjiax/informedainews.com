Mpox outbreak alarms health experts. A new strain spreads rapidly and is more lethal. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a global emergency. Cases have emerged in unexpected locations such as Sweden, Pakistan, and Thailand. The virus is transmitted through close contact, causing flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions. While typically mild, it can be fatal.

Dr. Hans Kluge of the WHO emphasizes that it is not a new Covid, and can be halted through cooperation. However, experts caution about unknowns, particularly with a new subvariant, clade 1b, which spreads more aggressively, particularly affecting young people and moving through sexual networks. More data is needed to understand and control it.

Clade 1 affects children, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals severely. The outbreak is worsening in countries with poor health systems, high HIV rates, and ongoing conflicts. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) reports over 15,000 cases and 537 deaths. Experts note inadequate controls and unlearned lessons from the previous outbreak.

Bavarian Nordic, the manufacturer of an approved mpox vaccine, may increase production. They are seeking EU approval to use it on teenagers. CEO Paul Chaplin highlights its importance for the current outbreak, with over 70% of cases in Africa occurring in individuals under 18.
