The National Development and Reform Commission and the National Energy Administration jointly released the "Implementation Plan for Large-scale Equipment Renewal in Key Energy Areas," aiming for a 25% or more increase in energy equipment investment by 2027. The focus is on upgrading coal-fired power units and renewing equipment for transmission and distribution, wind power, photovoltaics, and hydropower.

This initiative aims to enhance energy efficiency and promote the development of low-carbon technologies. The policy includes comprehensive renovations of old substations and transmission lines, as well as equipment updates in the hydropower and electric vehicle sectors.

Funding channels have been clarified to support large-scale equipment renewal and the trade-in of consumer goods. The policy encourages regions to tailor their approaches, increase investment subsidies, and broaden the pathways for low-carbon coal-fired power generation technologies.
