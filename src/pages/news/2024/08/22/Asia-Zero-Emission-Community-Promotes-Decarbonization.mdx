Asia Zero Emission Community, an 11-member group including Japan, Southeast Asia, and Australia, met in Indonesia. They agreed to promote decarbonization, considering each country's unique circumstances.

Focus areas include electric power, transportation, and industry. They aim to shift thermal power generation to hydrogen and ammonia, which don't emit carbon dioxide. Plans also include building supply chains for next-generation sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and biofuel for cars.

Japan will share its advanced technologies, particularly in hydrogen, ammonia, and energy saving.
