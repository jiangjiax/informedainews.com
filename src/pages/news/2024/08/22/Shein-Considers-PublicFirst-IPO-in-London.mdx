Shein, a Chinese fast-fashion giant, is considering a London IPO at a valuation of 500 billion pounds. They are contemplating a direct stock sale to the British public, a rare move. Typically, IPOs allocate shares to banks and funds initially, with individuals purchasing later.

Shein's advisors—JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley—are reviewing this public-first strategy. The plan is still in its early stages. Shein filed with the UK's FCA and Chinese regulators in June.

The company is also considering establishing its first UK warehouse, aiming to address tax complaints related to shipping from China. If successful, Shein's IPO would be London's largest, surpassing Glencore's 2011 debut.

Shein's current valuation stands at 660 billion dollars, following a 20 billion dollar fundraising in May. Investors include major funds like General Atlantic, Tiger Global, Sequoia China, and Mubadala.

Direct IPOs to the public have become less common. The UK government's aborted NatWest stock sale highlighted issues with discounted taxpayer-funded deals. However, platforms like Peel Hunt's RetailBook and PrimaryBid have eased the process for retail investors to participate in IPOs.

Shein and its advisors have yet to comment.
