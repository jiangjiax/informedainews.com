Blinken, US Secretary of State, concluded his Middle East tour. A ceasefire with Hamas remains elusive. A bridging proposal is on the table, accepted by Israel. Hamas is not directly negotiating and views the proposal as too Israeli-centric.

The proposal includes a six-week ceasefire, the initial release of female, elderly, and sick Israeli hostages, and the possibility of indefinite extension. The second stage involves exchanges of soldiers, Israeli troop withdrawal, and the return of Palestinians.

The key issue is that Hamas demands a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, which Israel rejects. Blinken clarified the US stance against long-term Israeli occupation. Netanyahu hinted at keeping troops in strategic Gaza corridors, but the White House denied this.

Egypt and Qatar are mediating. There is a fear of a wider regional conflict if the truce fails. Recent attacks in Tehran and Beirut, linked to Israel, have prompted Hezbollah and Iran to vow retaliation.

Casualties continue in Gaza. An Israeli airstrike hit a school, killing 10. Israel recovered six hostage bodies in Gaza, with details of their deaths unclear.
