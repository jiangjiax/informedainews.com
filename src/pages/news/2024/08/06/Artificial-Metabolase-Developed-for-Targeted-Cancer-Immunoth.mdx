Scientists at Shanghai Jiao Tong University have developed a new approach to cancer treatment. They've created an "artificial metabolase" that tweaks tumor cell metabolism, sparking an immune response. This method, detailed in Nature Nanotechnology, targets a broad metabolic marker in tumors, activating nearby immune cells to attack.

Traditional cancer treatments like surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation often lead to drug resistance and side effects. Immunotherapy, which uses the body's immune system to fight cancer, has shown promise but faces challenges like over-activation and individual variability.

The artificial metabolase mimics the action of natural enzymes, specifically xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), which plays a role in converting certain compounds in the body. By doing so, it triggers the production of uric acid within tumor cells. This uric acid acts as a signal, prompting immune cells like macrophages to attack the tumor.

This research, led by Professors Ling Daishun and Li Fangyuan, marks a shift towards more precise, metabolic-based cancer therapies. It's a promising step that could revolutionize how we treat not just cancer, but other diseases linked to metabolic abnormalities.
