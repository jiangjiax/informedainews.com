The "Brake Gate" incident involving Tesla at the Shanghai Auto Show has finally been resolved. The court ruled that Ms. Li from Xi'an must compensate Tesla 70,000 yuan, and Ms. Zhang from Henan must pay 170,000 yuan. Previously, Ms. Li and Ms. Zhang had accused Tesla of brake failure at the Shanghai Auto Show, causing Tesla's reputation to suffer and resulting in the loss of over 1.7 billion yuan in orders and tens of millions in goodwill.

The judicial appraisal institution commissioned by the court confirmed that Tesla's vehicle braking system was normal and effective, with no faults. Tesla subsequently sued the relevant individuals and was awarded a total of 490,000 yuan in compensation. Tesla has not participated in the Beijing/Shanghai Auto Show for three consecutive years since 2021.

The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology recently released a draft for public comment on the "Technical Requirements and Test Methods for Passenger Vehicle Braking Systems," aiming to further standardize braking systems, especially with new requirements for electric regenerative braking systems to reduce misuse. Tesla responded that the standard has not yet been officially implemented and does not affect existing products.

In summary, the resolution of Tesla's "Brake Gate" incident not only vindicated Tesla but also promoted the standardized development of new energy vehicle braking system technology. Passenger safety requires the joint efforts of automakers, regulations, and the public.
