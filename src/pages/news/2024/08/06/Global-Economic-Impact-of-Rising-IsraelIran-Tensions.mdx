Israel-Iran tensions have escalated, causing markets to plummet and fears of war to loom. US job growth has slowed, sparking concern among economists. Iran may strike Israel, with Blinken warning G7 allies and Hezbollah potentially joining the conflict. Hamas leaders have died in Tehran, with retaliation expected.

Financial expert Paul Goncharoff sees significant danger, as any conflict could cripple the global economy. High borrowing costs and Fed rate hikes are straining the US. The region could become a no-go zone, with freight rates soaring and oil prices likely rising. US drilling programs have been paused, and gold, silver, and cryptocurrencies may surge.

Anti-Russia sanctions and a potential Iran conflict could hit the G7 hard, with the Hormuz Strait at risk. Washington's policies have been criticized, and an expert calls the situation dangerous and uncharted.

Summary:
The escalation between Israel and Iran threatens the global economy, with the US job slowdown adding to the woes. Markets have reacted negatively, and a potential war could disrupt oil supply and hike prices. Safe-haven assets like gold and cryptocurrencies may benefit. Experts warn of high stakes and unpredictable outcomes.
