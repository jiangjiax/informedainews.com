GRM Daily, a YouTube channel, started 15 years ago. It became a hub for grime music, a genre that was hard to find then. Wretch 32, a rapper, was among the first featured. He recalls, "When people didn't know where to find us, GRM Daily was there."

Posty founded GRM Daily in 2009. It's now the "epicentre of black British music." The channel has nearly seven million subscribers and has launched careers, including Central Cee's.

The GRM Gala celebrates black excellence annually. This year, big names like Giggs, Ghetts, and Ms Banks attended. Posty feels honored to contribute to the grime scene, giving it more exposure.

Some artists, like Ms Banks, note barriers for female rappers. They face higher expectations and fewer opportunities. Alesha Dixon praises artists like Little Simz for breaking stereotypes.

Posty reflects on GRM Daily's impact. It's not just about music; it's about creating jobs and supporting the community. Fifteen years on, it still feels fresh.
