Flighty, a flight tracking app, now predicts delays using machine learning. It identifies major delay causes such as late aircraft and airspace issues, providing users with advance notice before airlines do.

The app's goal is to inform travelers early, allowing them to adjust their plans accordingly. For example, if an airline gradually delays a flight, Flighty might alert users to a significant delay due to a ground stop at the airport.

This technology also benefits airlines by enabling them to predict delays, optimize operations, enhance passenger satisfaction, and reduce costs.
