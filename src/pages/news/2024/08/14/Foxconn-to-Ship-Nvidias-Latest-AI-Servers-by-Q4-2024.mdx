Foxconn plans to ship Nvidia's GB200 AI servers by the end of the year. The Taiwanese tech giant aims to start with a small batch in Q4 2024, ramping up in Q1 2025. Despite initial delays, Foxconn remains confident, citing strong demand for previous Nvidia AI server models.

AI servers currently account for 40% of Foxconn's server business and 40% of the global AI server market. The company projects this sector will soon reach a trillion-dollar valuation.

Nvidia's GB200 features two Blackwell B200 GPUs, one Grace CPU, and eight high-bandwidth memory chips. The GB200 NVL72, which links 72 GB200 servers, boasts a 30-fold performance increase over its H100 counterpart.

Supply chain challenges, including advanced chip packaging from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and redesigned power and thermal systems, have delayed shipments. These components require extensive testing.

Foxconn's Q2 2024 net income rose 6% to NT$35.04 billion. Revenue for the first seven months of 2024 increased 6.54% to NT$3.446 trillion. The company expects a 15% rise in revenue from components and cloud computing for the current quarter, with consumer electronics stable.
