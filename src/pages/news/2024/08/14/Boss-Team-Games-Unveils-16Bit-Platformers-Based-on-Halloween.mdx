Boss Team Games, creators of Evil Dead: The Game, unveil RetroRealms. This new venture features two 16-bit platformers. One draws from John Carpenter's Halloween, the other from Ash vs Evil Dead.

16-bit platformers: video games characterized by pixelated graphics and simple gameplay mechanics, popular in the late 80s and early 90s.
