Google's dominance in web search is facing scrutiny. The US Department of Justice has hinted at a possible breakup. Android, which is part of Alphabet, could be a target for divestment. This could impact pre-installed apps like Chrome and Gmail.

Alternatively, Google might be required to share search data, aligning with EU mandates. This could help even the competition. Exclusive agreements, such as Google's deal with Apple, are set to conclude. Apple is looking into new revenue sources, such as Patreon subscriptions.

Divestment refers to selling off parts of a company to reduce its size or focus on core activities.
