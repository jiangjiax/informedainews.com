Scientists at MIT have developed a new adhesive material that prevents fibrosis, a scarring process that can disable implanted medical devices like pacemakers. This adhesive, dubbed a "non-fibrotic adhesive," bonds the device to surrounding tissue, shielding it from the body's immune response.

Typically, when a foreign object is implanted, the body reacts by forming a fibrous capsule around it, which can impair the device's function. This new adhesive prevents this by creating a strong bond between the device and the tissue, essentially camouflaging the device.

The adhesive is made from polymers like chitosan or polyvinyl alcohol, materials that are cheap, widely available, and mechanically compatible with human tissue. It has been tested in various animal models, including mice, rats, and pigs, with promising results across different organs.

This innovation could extend the lifespan and effectiveness of implanted devices, from pacemakers to sensors and drug delivery systems. The researchers are now working towards human trials, aiming to bring this technology to clinical use within the next few years.
