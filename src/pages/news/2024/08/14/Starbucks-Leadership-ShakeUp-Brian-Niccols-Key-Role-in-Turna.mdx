Starbucks has revamped its leadership, removing Laxman Narasimhan from the CEO position. Taking his place is Brian Niccol, the former head of Chipotle. Following this announcement, the company's shares surged by 24.5%.

Jim Cramer, a CNBC commentator, applauded the decision. He contended that Narasimhan, coming from a background in consulting and packaged goods, was not the ideal fit. According to Cramer, Starbucks required a leader with expertise in the fast-food industry.

Niccol's time at Chipotle was marked by success. He enhanced food quality, improved store efficiency, and optimized customer flow. Cramer pointed out Niccol's measured approach to expanding the menu, which sharply contrasts with Starbucks' recent over-expansion.

Cramer views Niccol as pivotal for Starbucks' resurgence. He believes Niccol can reinstate Starbucks as the "third place"â€”neither home nor work, but Starbucks. The recovery process may not be swift, but it is expected to occur.

Starbucks has not provided any comments regarding this leadership change.
