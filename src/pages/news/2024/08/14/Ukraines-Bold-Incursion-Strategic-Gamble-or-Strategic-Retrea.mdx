Ukraine's recent incursion into Russia's Kursk oblast has stirred the pot. The move, bold and well-executed, showcased Ukraine's mastery of modern warfare, blending air defense, electronic warfare, armor, and infantry. This contrasts with last year's failed offensive.

The question now: stay or retreat? Staying could pressure Russia to shift troops from the Donbas, and provide a bargaining chip in future peace talks. Retreating, however, might undermine these goals.

Russia's reaction will be fierce. Putin views Ukraine's presence on Russian soil as intolerable. Expect increased attacks as Russia tries to reclaim the territory.

The gamble's success remains uncertain. Sustaining the incursion and holding the territory will be challenging, especially with lengthening supply lines.

This move is Ukraine's boldest yet, and its riskiest. The outcome will shape the conflict's trajectory.
