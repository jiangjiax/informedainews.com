The "Sarcastic AI" Twitter personality has quickly gained popularity, earning up to $4,000 per hour. This AI application analyzes the historical tweets of public accounts to provide sharp commentary without requiring special permissions. User numbers surged to 5 million, earning $22,000 in just 8 hours.

Developer Kyzo announced the complete open-sourcing on GitHub, making the code and prompts public to encourage the creation of custom applications. However, the rapid increase in users led to soaring server costs, prompting founder Filip to urgently seek help and eventually adopt a dynamic pricing model adjusted according to regional purchasing power.

The development platform behind it, Wordware, is valued at $180 million and supports users in building complex AI applications. Its modular design is similar to Notion, operating in units as small as "one line." Wordware received investment from YC, and with only a team of three, founders Filip and Robert have deep backgrounds in AI.

The success of "Sarcastic AI" showcases the entertainment potential of AI on social media and sparks thoughts on balancing commercialization with open-source principles. The proliferation of AI applications not only changes how businesses use AI but also involves more people in AI development, embodying the concept of AI enhancing human capabilities.
