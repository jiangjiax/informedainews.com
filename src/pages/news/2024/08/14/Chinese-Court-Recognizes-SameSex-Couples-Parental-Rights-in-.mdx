Didi, a 42-year-old woman in Shanghai, won the right to monthly visits with her daughter after a four-year separation. This marks a first in Chinese courts, recognizing a child can have two legal mothers. Didi and her ex-wife, now estranged, married in the US in 2016 and underwent IVF treatment. Didi gave birth to their daughter in 2017, while her wife gave birth to a son.

The Beijing court's decision is a milestone for LGBT rights in China, though Didi's son remains out of reach. Chinese law lacks clear provisions for same-sex couples, especially in shared motherhood scenarios. Didi's case highlights the legal complexities faced by LGBT families.

Despite the victory, Didi's access to her son is denied, reflecting ongoing challenges in Chinese legal recognition of same-sex families. The case has sparked discussions on social media and in academic circles, advocating for legal reforms to catch up with societal changes. Didi hopes for incremental legal recognition of same-sex households in China.
