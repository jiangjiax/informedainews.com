Windfall Bio, a California startup, utilizes methane-consuming microbes known as "mems" to convert methane into fertilizer. Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, originates from agriculture, landfills, and oil production. Windfall's technique involves placing these microbes near methane sources. The mems consume methane and produce clean fertilizer.

Josh Silverman, Windfall's CEO, explains their strategy: customers place mems packets near methane sources. Farmers, dairy operators, and oil companies can use the resulting fertilizer or sell it back to Windfall. This method bypasses the high energy consumption and carbon emissions associated with traditional fertilizer production.

Windfall has experienced high demand, operating on every continent. They plan a pilot with Whole Foods' dairy suppliers to reduce methane emissions. Backed by notable investors, including Amazon and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Windfall has raised $37 million.

This innovation could significantly contribute to global climate efforts by reducing methane emissions and providing a sustainable source of fertilizer.
