U.N. urges China to review Xinjiang policies. Two years after a critical report, the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights calls for a full review of laws and policies in Xinjiang, citing ongoing human rights concerns.

The U.N. team discussed China’s criminal justice system and policies, sparking allegations of abuses against Uyghurs and Tibetans. Ravina Shamdasani, spokesperson for the human rights office, highlighted the need for a human rights perspective on national security and counterterrorism laws, and stronger protection against discrimination for minorities.

Allegations of torture and human rights violations require thorough investigation. The U.N. faces challenges monitoring the situation due to limited access and fear of reprisals.

Rights groups accuse Beijing of detaining and abusing Uyghurs and other Turkic-Muslim minorities, including forced labor and internment camps. Beijing denies these allegations, framing the programs as anti-terrorism measures.

Rayhan Asat, a human rights lawyer, praised U.N. rights Commissioner Volker Turk for his commitment but noted little progress since the 2022 report. The report concluded that China’s treatment of Uyghurs may constitute crimes against humanity. Despite Chinese pressure, the U.N. Human Rights Council narrowly voted against debating the report.

Other U.N. expert committees also allege rights abuses. A recent U.N. review found Beijing increasingly rejecting recommendations and limiting access to Xinjiang.
