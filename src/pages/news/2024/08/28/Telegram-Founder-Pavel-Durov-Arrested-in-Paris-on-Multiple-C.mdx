Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, has been arrested in Paris. Charges against him include aiding drug trafficking, money laundering, and distributing child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Telegram's lax moderation and refusal to cooperate with law enforcement have been highlighted.

Durov faces 12 charges, grouped into four categories:
1. Complicity in illegal activities.
2. Non-cooperation with law enforcement.
3. Unreported cryptographic features.
4. Membership in a criminal association and money laundering.

Telegram's new digital currency, Stars, and its conversion to Toncoin, a cryptocurrency, raise suspicions of money laundering. The app's built-in crypto wallet and Toncoin transactions complicate matters.

Durov's arrest is unrelated to the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA). French President Emmanuel Macron denies political motives. Durov's detention can last up to 96 hours, after which the court must decide on formal indictment and potential custody.

**Explanation of Terms:**
- **CSAM:** Child Sexual Abuse Material.
- **DSA:** Digital Services Act, EU regulation governing digital platforms.
- **Toncoin:** Cryptocurrency used by Telegram for various features.
