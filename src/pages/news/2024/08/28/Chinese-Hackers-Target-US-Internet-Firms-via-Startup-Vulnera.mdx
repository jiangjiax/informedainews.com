Chinese hackers, backed by the state, breached US and Indian internet firms. They exploited a bug in Versa Networks, a California startup. Lumen's Black Lotus Labs identified the breaches, linking them to Volt Typhoon. This campaign targets critical US infrastructure, including water facilities and the power grid. Versa has issued a patch for the bug, but concerns persist about US vulnerability to cyberattacks.
