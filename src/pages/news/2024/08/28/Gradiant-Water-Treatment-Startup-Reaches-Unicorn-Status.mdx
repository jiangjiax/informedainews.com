Gradiant, a water treatment startup, has now become a unicorn. They've raised $228 million. Their technology recycles wastewater, cutting costs in half. They claim to recover 99% of water, unlike others who manage 50-60%.

Their process mimics rain. Wastewater heats, turns to vapor, leaving contaminants behind. The vapor then mixes with cool water, condensing into fresh water. They save 1.7 billion gallons daily, enough for 48 million people.

Clients include Coca-Cola, BMW, Pfizer. They've secured over $500 million in orders this year. Investors like General Innovation Capital Partners support them. They also have backing from Warburg Pincus, M&G Investments, and others.

Scaling is tough. Gradiant offers a full solution, a rarity in the industry. Their growth attracts more funding, promising a cleaner future.
