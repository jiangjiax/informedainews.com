X/Twitter is adding a video conferencing tool, X Conference. It's similar to Zoom and Teams, already supports voice chats, and will now include video. The tool will feature spatial audio and automatic subtitles for English speakers. Likely, it will allow selective video streaming, where some users can opt to show video while others don't. This move seems natural for X, given its history of expanding features.
