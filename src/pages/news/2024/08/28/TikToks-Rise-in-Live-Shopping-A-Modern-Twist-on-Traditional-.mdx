TikTok's For You Page is now bustling with live sales events, reminiscent of the '90s TV shopping channel QVC. Made By Mitchell, a makeup brand, earned $1 million in just 12 hours through a TikTok live stream. Live shopping, which has been popular in China, is gaining traction in the UK and US. TikTok Shop, launched in 2022, is driving this trend.

Live selling flourishes on the immediacy and sense of community it creates. Josh Reais, from Luxe Collective, observes the daily engagement of viewers who negotiate prices, make purchases, and bond over luxury fashion. This format combines the convenience of online shopping with the camaraderie of in-store experiences.

Whatnot, another platform, targets collectors. Daniel Fisher, its General Manager, emphasizes their focus on passion rather than just purchases. As traditional shopping declines, live shopping provides a dynamic and interactive retail experience.
