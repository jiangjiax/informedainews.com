France plans to implement a mobile phone ban in 197 schools for children under 15, requiring phones to be handed in at reception. This trial, aimed at creating a "digital pause," builds on a 2018 law that only restricted phone use, not possession. If successful, the ban will be extended nationwide in January.

A presidential commission has warned about the detrimental effects of screen time on children's health and development. Their report links digital devices to issues such as sleep disturbances, sedentary habits, and obesity.
