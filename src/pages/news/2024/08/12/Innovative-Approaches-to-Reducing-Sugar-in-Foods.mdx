Scientists at Harvard's Wyss Institute are developing a "sugar-to-fiber" enzyme. This enzyme, encased in tiny pectin cages, converts sugar to fiber in the intestine. The goal is to reduce sugar absorption by 30%. This technology could also address lactose and gluten issues. It remains costly and is better suited for solid foods.

Another approach comes from Biolumen's Monch Monch, a drink mix that uses microscopic sponges to absorb sugar in the stomach. One gram can sequester six grams of sugar. It is available online, and discussions are underway with food manufacturers.

Magic Spoon uses allulose, a natural sugar derived from figs and raisins, which does not contribute to sugar totals on labels. Tate & Lyle produces allulose from corn, and it tastes like sugar but is not metabolized.

Blommer Chocolate uses Incredo, a sugar modified to taste sweeter with a fast-dissolving mineral carrier. This allows for up to 50% less sugar in products.

Researchers are also modifying individual sugar crystals to dissolve quickly, enhancing sweetness.
