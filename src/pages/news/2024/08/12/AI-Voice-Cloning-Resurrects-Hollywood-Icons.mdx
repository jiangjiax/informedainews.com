Hollywood's past stars, such as Burt Reynolds and Judy Garland, are making a comeback through AI voice cloning. ElevenLabs, supported by major venture capital firms, enables this with its IconicVoices tool. The tool allows these stars' voices to read texts within an app but restricts exporting the voices or using them outside the app.

This technology, though controversial, is being handled through agreements with celebrity estates. It provides a controlled method to utilize AI voices, sidestepping some legal and ethical concerns. ElevenLabs collaborates with prominent publishers and was selected by Disney for its accelerator program.

Crafting a professional voice clone necessitates approximately 30 minutes of high-quality audio. The AI analyzes the actor's vocal patterns and subtleties, striving to sound identical to the real person.

Nonetheless, the technology sparks concerns. Voice actors fear their roles might be usurped or their voices used without permission. Legal disputes regarding AI voice usage are already underway.

ElevenLabs asserts that it prioritizes safety, implementing content moderation and accountability protocols. The future of AI voice technology appears promising yet intricate, with ongoing discussions about permissions, remuneration, and control.
