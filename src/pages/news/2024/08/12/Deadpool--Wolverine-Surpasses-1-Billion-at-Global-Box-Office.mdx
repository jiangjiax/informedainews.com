"Deadpool & Wolverine" crossed $1 billion globally. Only the second R-rated film to do so. Surpassed "Joker," which made $1.078 billion. Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman led the charge. Disney and Marvel's strategy paid off: viral marketing, perfect release timing, and relentless promotion. The film's success marks a rebound for Disney post-pandemic.

Disney's reliance on established franchises is evident. "Inside Out 2" also hit $1 billion this year. Upcoming films like "Moana 2," "Toy Story 5," and "Frozen III" aim for similar heights. The Marvel Cinematic Universe, already at $30 billion, continues with new titles like "Captain America: Brave New World" and "Avengers: Secret Wars."
