Scientists have discovered how gluten triggers celiac disease, which begins in the cells lining the gut rather than solely in immune cells. These gut lining cells enhance the immune response, leading to symptoms. Bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa can exacerbate the condition. This finding could pave the way for new medications. Currently, only gluten-free diets provide relief, but they are not flawless. The study has been published in Gastroenterology.

Celiac disease: an immune reaction to gluten that causes gut damage and symptoms such as diarrhea and bloating.

Gluten: a protein found in grains like wheat, barley, and rye.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa: a harmful bacterium often found in hospitals, known for causing infections.
