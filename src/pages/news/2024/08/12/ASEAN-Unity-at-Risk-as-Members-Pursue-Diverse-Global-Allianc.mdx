ASEAN's unity is showing signs of strain as Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia pursue divergent global alliances. Indonesia is eyeing membership in the OECD, Thailand is interested in both the OECD and BRICS, while Malaysia is leaning towards BRICS.

The OECD, consisting of developed nations, stands in contrast to BRICS, which represents the Global South. Indonesia, with a GDP per capita of $4,942, is closer to the economic range of BRICS, yet it seeks OECD membership for credibility and economic reform. Malaysia, with a higher GDP per capita, views BRICS as a means to diversify and reduce reliance on the dollar.

Each country's choice reflects its unique diplomatic history and current economic needs. Indonesia's past as a non-aligned leader influences its bid for OECD membership. Malaysia's strategic shift towards BRICS aims to navigate geopolitical risks. Thailand's dual pursuit balances current and future markets.

ASEAN's cohesion is under pressure as its members pursue independent paths in a rapidly changing global order.
