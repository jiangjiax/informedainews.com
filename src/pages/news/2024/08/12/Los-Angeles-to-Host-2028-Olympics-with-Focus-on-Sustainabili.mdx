Los Angeles is set to host the 2028 Olympics, marking the third time for the city. The opening ceremony is scheduled for July 14, 2028, and for the first time, the Paralympics will be included.

No new permanent structures are planned; existing venues such as the LA Memorial Coliseum and SoFi Stadium will be utilized. Beach volleyball will be held on an actual beach.

Sustainability is a key focus, with the aim of a car-free event, relying on buses. The budget is estimated at nearly $7 billion.

New sports debuting include cricket, lacrosse, paraclimbing, and flag football. Baseball/softball and squash are returning, while skateboarding, surfing, and sport climbing continue.

Stars to watch include Keely Hodgkinson, LÃ©on Marchand, and Sky Brown. Simone Biles' participation is uncertain.

LA faces challenges in matching Paris's public transport and setting a new standard for Olympic glamour.
