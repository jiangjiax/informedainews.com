China-built Mazan Oil and Gas Gathering and Transportation Platform, weighing 17,000 tons, is the largest in the world. It took 34 months to construct and is set to head to the waters off Saudi Arabia. The platform integrates cutting-edge systems, with a deck as large as 15 basketball courts and standing as tall as a 25-story building. It has an annual oil transportation capacity of 2,400 million tons and a gas transportation capacity of 7.4 billion cubic meters. Following the increase in oilfield production, it will produce 2,400 million tons of oil annually, equivalent to the annual output of China's Shengli Oilfield.
