The Paris 2024 Olympics concluded with a spectacular finale. Tom Cruise made a dramatic entrance at the Stade de France to pass the flag to Los Angeles, which will host the 2028 Games. The ceremony was capped off with performances by Red Hot Chili Peppers, Billie Eilish, Snoop Dogg, and Dr Dre on Venice Beach.

Gold medalists Alex Yee and Bryony Page led Great Britain, finishing seventh in the medal table with 65 medals, an improvement from their tally at Tokyo 2020.

IOC president Thomas Bach described these Games as "sensational," highlighting a new era of full gender parity and sustainability. He commended the athletes for demonstrating human excellence and promoting a culture of peace.
