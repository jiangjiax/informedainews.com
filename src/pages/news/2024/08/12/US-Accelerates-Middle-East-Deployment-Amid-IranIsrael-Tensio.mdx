US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered the Abraham Lincoln strike group, including fighter jets and navy warships, to speed up deployment to the Middle East. This move follows the assassination of senior Hamas and Hezbollah members, sparking fears of retaliatory attacks by Iran on Israel.

Austin also announced the deployment of a guided missile submarine, a rare public disclosure. This follows earlier commitments to bolster Israeli defenses with additional jets and warships.

Ismail Haniyeh, a key Hamas leader, was killed in Tehran, with Iran blaming Israel, though Israel has not claimed responsibility. The killing of Hezbollah's Fuad Shukr in Beirut further escalated tensions, raising fears of a broader Middle East conflict.

Hamas, backed by Iran, has shown reluctance to resume ceasefire negotiations, despite calls from the US, Egypt, and Qatar for talks to finalize a ceasefire and hostage release by August 15.

Israel has indicated its willingness to negotiate, but Hamas's recent statements suggest it may avoid further talks, demanding a direct implementation of previously agreed terms based on President Biden's proposal.

In Gaza, thousands fled Khan Younis after Israeli warnings of a new operation targeting regrouped Hamas militants. The city saw extensive damage earlier this year during prolonged Israeli military efforts.

Biden's three-phase ceasefire proposal, outlined in May, has faced repeated obstacles in implementation.
