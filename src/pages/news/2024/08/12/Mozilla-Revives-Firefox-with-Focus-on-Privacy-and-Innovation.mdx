Mozilla's new interim CEO, Laura Chambers, is refocusing on Firefox. After years of neglect chasing other ventures, like VPN and email masking, Firefox is back in the spotlight. Chambers sees it as crucial not just for Mozilla but for the internet itself.

They're adding features like vertical tabs and tab grouping, and rethinking web apps. Mozilla's also testing a privacy-focused ad measurement system, which is less invasive than Google's alternatives.

Financially, Mozilla leans heavily on Google, which paid $510 million to be Firefox's default search engine in 2022. Chambers aims to reduce this dependency, exploring ad-tech and generative AI as potential revenue streams.

Expect a stronger marketing push for Firefox, emphasizing its independence and commitment to user privacy. Mozilla's strategy is to quickly test new products and features, seeing what sticks.
