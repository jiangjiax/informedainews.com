Central banks are ditching dollars for gold. US debt's a problem, warned Fed's Powell. Bukele calls US money-printing a bubble. Dollar's grip weakens in global reserves. Gold's appeal grows, seen as stable. IMF data shows dollar's share down. Yuan's reserve use also drops. Gold buying hits high in 2023. China leads in gold hoarding. India boosts gold reserves, moves some home. Geopolitical tensions drive gold demand. Bukele criticizes US financial system.

Gold's allure stems from its perceived stability and non-reliance on any single nation's policies. Central banks, wary of geopolitical risks and currency manipulation, are shifting towards this traditional safe-haven asset. The trend underscores a broader loss of faith in fiat currencies, especially the dollar, amid ongoing global uncertainties.
