Scientists have created a new type of insulin that adjusts to blood sugar levels in real time. This "smart" insulin could revolutionize how millions with type 1 diabetes manage their condition.

Currently, patients inject synthetic insulin up to 10 times a day. This constant need to balance blood sugar can lead to health issues and stress. The new insulin, known as glucose-responsive insulin (GRI), only activates when blood sugar is high, preventing both high and low blood sugar levels.

Researchers from the US, Australia, and China are collaborating on this project. They've received millions in funding to expedite development. The aim is to reduce the frequency of insulin injections, potentially to once a week.

This new insulin mimics the body's natural response to sugar levels. It could alleviate the daily challenges of managing diabetes and enhance overall health. The research is backed by organizations like Diabetes UK and JDRF, with the goal of achieving transformative advancements in diabetes care.
