The State Council of China has issued the "Opinions on Accelerating the Comprehensive Green Transformation of Economic and Social Development," aimed at promoting the green transformation of the transportation industry. The plan emphasizes the promotion of new energy vehicles and electrified urban public service vehicles, and encourages the use of clean power for ships, aircraft, and non-road mobile machinery. The goal is to reduce the carbon emission intensity of operational vehicles by 9.5% by 2030 and to make new energy vehicles the mainstream by 2035. Additionally, the document involves enhancing the green and intelligent level of transportation infrastructure, developing a low-carbon transportation service system, and improving the utilization of new energy and urban-rural logistics distribution systems. In terms of energy transition, the State Council plans to vigorously develop non-fossil energy, advance the construction of clean energy bases and new energy development, with the goal of increasing the proportion of non-fossil energy consumption to 25% by 2030.
