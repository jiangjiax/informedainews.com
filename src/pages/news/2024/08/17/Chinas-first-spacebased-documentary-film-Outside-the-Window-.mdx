"Beyond the Window Lies the Blue Planet," China's first space documentary filmed in real-time, has received approval from the National Film Administration. Produced by China Central Television, the script is written by Zhu Yiran. The Shenzhou XIII astronauts will use an 8K ultra-high-definition camera to film inside the Chinese space station. The film aims to provide an immersive space experience and showcase the lives of astronauts. Previously, the China Manned Space Engineering Office released an 8K short film of the same name.
