Kristen Faulkner, 31, a Harvard graduate and former venture capitalist, stunned the world by winning two Olympic gold medals in cycling. Her journey began in Alaska, where rugged outdoor activities were the norm. At Harvard, she balanced her studies in computer science with rowing, setting records.

After college, Faulkner worked in venture capital, but her passion for cycling, ignited at the age of 24, grew. She focused on her strengths, avoiding the pitfalls of trying to be a well-rounded cyclist. Her analytical skills from her VC work translated into strategic racing tactics.

In 2021, she quit her job to train full-time. Despite a near-career-ending crash, she recovered and excelled, winning national titles. At the Olympics, she seized unexpected opportunities, becoming the first American woman to win gold in both road and track cycling at the same games.

Her story echoes that of Anna Kiesenhofer, an Austrian mathematician who won gold in Tokyo's road race. Both women, with no professional cycling backgrounds, defied expectations, proving that intellect and athleticism can coexist.

Faulkner's next challenge: the Women's Tour de France, riding a bike named "Wonder Woman." Her tale is one of resilience, passion, and the unexpected paths to greatness.
