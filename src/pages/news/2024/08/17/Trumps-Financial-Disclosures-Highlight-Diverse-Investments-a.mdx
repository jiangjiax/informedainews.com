Trump's latest financial disclosures reveal a complex financial landscape. He made hundreds of thousands from his branded Bible and millions from properties, yet faces millions in debts from defamation and fraud cases. His global financial interests span countries like China, Saudi Arabia, and Israel.

He holds millions in cryptocurrency and a six-figure investment in gold bars. His Mar-a-Lago club income dropped by $8 million. The disclosures lack detailed financial statements, leaving his solvency unclear.

Trump's fortune rose to $6.5 billion, boosted by a Spac merger for his media group, though its value has since declined. His running mate, JD Vance, has a net worth of $4 million, including $250,000 in bitcoin.

Trump earned $12 million through licensing deals, including $7 million from NFT trading cards and $5 million in royalties from recent books. His Bible, in collaboration with singer Lee Greenwood, earned $300,000.

He supports cryptocurrencies and holds between $1 and $5 million in Ethereum. His son Eric is also involved in crypto. Melania Trump earned $237,500 from a speaking engagement and $330,000 from NFTs.

Changes in Trump's real estate empire include dissolving three Chinese companies related to real estate deals and paying off a Deutsche Bank mortgage on his Chicago hotel.
