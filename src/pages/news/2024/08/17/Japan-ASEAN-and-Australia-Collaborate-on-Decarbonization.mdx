TOKYO â€” Japan is collaborating with ASEAN and Australia to significantly reduce carbon emissions in a region heavily reliant on fossil fuels. The Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC), which includes 11 nations, is meeting in Indonesia. Japan's Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry, Ken Saito, is leading the Japanese delegation.

AZEC is focusing on three key sectors: electricity, transportation, and industry. A 10-year plan is being developed, with an emphasis on decarbonizing thermal power using hydrogen and ammonia as fuels. Japan is currently testing these technologies.

The transportation policy aims to increase the use of sustainable aviation fuel and biofuels through regional supply chains. Industrial policies are promoting renewable energy in manufacturing parks and energy-saving technologies.

AZEC, initiated by Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in 2022, includes nine ASEAN members, Japan, and Australia. An AZEC summit is scheduled for October in Laos.
