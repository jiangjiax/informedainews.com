India plans to hold elections in Jammu and Kashmir, its only Muslim-majority region, starting September 18. This marks the first regional polls in a decade, following the revocation of the area's special autonomy in 2019. The decision aligns with a Supreme Court order demanding these polls by September 30.

Jammu and Kashmir has been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan since their 1947 independence from Britain. Both nations claim the region entirely but govern parts of it, having fought three wars, two over Kashmir.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government argues that ending Kashmir's special status has brought stability and spurred economic growth through new projects and a thriving tourism sector. However, tensions persist, with India accusing Pakistan of supporting insurgency in the region.

Despite past security threats and low voter turnout, recent parliamentary elections saw a significant increase, reaching 58.46% participationâ€”the highest in 35 years. This surge is seen as a positive sign of local trust in the democratic process.
