Indonesia's President Joko "Jokowi" Widodo presided over the country's 79th Independence Day ceremony in Nusantara, the future capital. This event signified a significant step in the government's plan to relocate the capital from Jakarta.

Approximately 1,400 guests participated in the scaled-down ceremony at the new State Palace. The event featured a flag-raising, a military parade, a flypast, and cultural performances. Attendees included state officials, politicians, business leaders, and construction workers involved in the $29.7 billion project slated for completion in 2045.

Local residents voiced optimism about the development, highlighting improvements in infrastructure and job opportunities. The government trimmed the guest list from 8,000 due to construction delays and investment shortfalls.

Vice President Maâ€™ruf Amin led a simultaneous ceremony in Jakarta. Jokowi stressed the importance of tangible progress on the ground before officially relocating the capital. President-elect Prabowo Subianto, who will take office on October 20, vowed to continue the project, aiming for completion within three to five years.

Nusantara, still under construction, is transforming from a eucalyptus plantation into a modern administrative center. New palaces, ministry towers, and residential complexes are emerging, with some bureaucrats scheduled to move in next month.
