Scientists from the U.S. and Israel have solved a mystery that intrigued Charles Darwin: plants move. Not in the way animals do, but by growing in spirals and zigzags. This slow and subtle behavior helps them find sunlight.

Orit Peleg and Yasmine Meroz led a study using time-lapse videos and computer simulations. They discovered that sunflower seedlings, growing in circles, use these movements to track the sun. This isn't random; it's a strategy to maximize light exposure.

The research, published in Physical Review X, suggests that controlled movements in plants are crucial for their survival. These findings could lead to improved farming techniques, optimizing crop growth.

Darwin, even in his later years, was fascinated by plant movements. He observed and documented these behaviors, though he couldn't explain them. Now, with modern technology, we understand that these movements are not chaotic but are essential for plant growth.

In essence, plants, through slow, deliberate movements, adapt to their environment, ensuring their survival. This research not only solves an old mystery but also opens new avenues for agricultural science.
