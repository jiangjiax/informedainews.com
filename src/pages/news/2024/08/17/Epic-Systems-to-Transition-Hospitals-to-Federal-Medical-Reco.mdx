Epic Systems, a major player in healthcare software, plans to shift all its customers to a new federal medical records network by 2025. This network, called TEFCA, aims to simplify the sharing of patient data across different healthcare providers. Currently, medical records are scattered among various formats and vendors, complicating access for doctors.

Epic, with records for over 280 million Americans, is pivotal in this transition. TEFCA provides a unified framework for secure data exchange, addressing privacy concerns under HIPAA, which mandates patient consent for data access.

Carequality, another interoperability network, is also aligning with TEFCA. It currently links over 70% of U.S. hospitals and numerous clinics and providers. This alignment aims to prevent misuse of patient records, ensuring data is shared only for legitimate medical purposes.

Epic's move bolsters TEFCA's credibility, potentially bringing more hospitals into the network and enhancing trust among healthcare organizations. This shift is crucial for streamlining patient care and data management in the healthcare sector.
