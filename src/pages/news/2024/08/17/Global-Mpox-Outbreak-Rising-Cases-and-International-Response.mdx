Mpox cases surge outside Africa. ECDC raises risk level. Pakistan and China report first cases. UK prepares for potential outbreaks.

Clade I mpox, endemic in Africa, now spreads via sexual and non-sexual contact. Over 14,000 cases and 524 deaths in Africa this year. Tecovirimat, an antiviral drug, showed no benefit in recent trials.

Global health emergency declared. More research needed on clade Ib transmission dynamics. Africa faces critical shortages of diagnostic kits, treatments, and vaccines.

Gavi, the vaccines alliance, may provide 65,000 doses soon. Bavarian Nordic aims to produce 10 million vaccine doses by 2025.

**Explanation:**
- **ECDC:** European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, a European Union agency responsible for public health.
- **Clade I and II:** Variants of the mpox virus, with clade I being more prevalent in Africa and historically more deadly.
- **Tecovirimat:** An antiviral drug used to treat mpox, also known as TPOXX.
- **Gavi:** The Vaccine Alliance, a global partnership aimed at improving access to vaccines in low-income countries.
