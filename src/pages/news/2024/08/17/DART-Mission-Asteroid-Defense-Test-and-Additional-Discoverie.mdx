NASA's DART mission, which involved colliding with Dimorphos, tested asteroid deflection techniques. Post-impact studies revealed the geology and history of the Didymos system. Key findings include: Dimorphos likely separated from Didymos, its surface is young and fragile, which facilitated DART's orbital adjustment.

Images from DART and LICIACube displayed Dimorphos's rugged landscape and Didymos's smoother, older surface. Analysis indicates that Dimorphos may have formed from Didymos's debris, influenced by rotational forces and mass loss events.

Further research detailed the asteroids' surface materials, internal structures, and formation processes. Notably, thermal fatigue rapidly deteriorates Dimorphos's boulders, changing its surface more quickly than anticipated.

DART's success confirms kinetic impact as an effective defense against asteroid threats. The upcoming ESA's Hera mission will revisit the site in 2026, enhancing our understanding and planetary defense strategies.
