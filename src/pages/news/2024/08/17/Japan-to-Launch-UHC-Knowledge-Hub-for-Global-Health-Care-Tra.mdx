Tokyo will host a UHC Knowledge Hub in 2025. This center aims to train officials from developing nations on setting up health care systems. The hub is a joint effort by Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, the Ministry of Finance, the World Bank, and the World Health Organization.

UHC, or universal health coverage, ensures all people get basic care at a reasonable cost. As of 2021, about 4.5 billion people lacked essential health services. The United Nations has made UHC a goal for 2030.

At the hub, officials will study Japan’s health insurance and medical systems, along with their challenges. They’ll use this knowledge to design programs for their countries. Financial officials will also attend, learning how to fund social security.

Japan’s health care system is known for its affordability and efficiency, despite some issues. It has contributed to the country’s high life expectancy.

If Japan’s system spreads, it could boost demand for advanced medical care, opening markets for Japanese medical equipment companies. Aging populations in Southeast Asia also present opportunities for Japanese companies in long-term care.

Japan already trains health professionals from developing countries. The new hub will expand these efforts, hosting international conferences on UHC.
