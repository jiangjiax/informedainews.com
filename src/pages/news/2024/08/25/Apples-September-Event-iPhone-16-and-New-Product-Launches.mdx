Apple's major iPhone event is scheduled for September 10. Anticipate the launch of the iPhone 16, new AirPods, and the Apple Watch Series 10. The iPhone 16 will see modest enhancements over its predecessor, featuring a bigger screen and improved camera functions on the Pro versions.

The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max will come with 6.3 and 6.9-inch screens, respectively. A new Capture Button, akin to a camera shutter, will be introduced on all iPhone 16 models, improving photo and video capture capabilities.

Apple Intelligence, an AI-powered personal assistant, will be a standout feature, supported by the A18 chip. The Watch Series 10 will be slimmer with a larger display, and AirPods will introduce noise cancellation for the first time in the mid-tier model.

Updates to the Mac lineup are in progress but will not be unveiled at this event. New Macs equipped with M4 chips are being tested for compatibility with third-party applications.
