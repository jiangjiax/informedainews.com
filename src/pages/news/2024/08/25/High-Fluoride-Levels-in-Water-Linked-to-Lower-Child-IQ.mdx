A new US government report links high fluoride levels in drinking water to lower IQ in children. The National Toxicology Program found that water with more than 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter consistently lowers kids' IQs.

Fluoride, known for strengthening teeth, has been added to drinking water for decades. The current recommended limit is 0.7 milligrams per liter. The World Health Organization sets a safe limit at 1.5 milligrams.

About 1.9 million Americans drink water with naturally high fluoride levels. The report calls for more research and protection measures for these populations.

The American Dental Association, a longtime supporter of water fluoridation, is reviewing the report. Fluoride is naturally present in water and soil, and its benefits for dental health were discovered about 80 years ago.

The report raises questions about fluoride's impact on brain development, especially in children. It suggests pregnant women might need to reduce their fluoride intake from water and certain teas.
