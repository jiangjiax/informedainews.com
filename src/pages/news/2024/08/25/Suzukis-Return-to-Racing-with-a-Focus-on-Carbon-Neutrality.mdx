Suzuki Motor returned to racing, focusing on carbon neutrality. They finished eighth in the Suzuka 8 Hours endurance race.

The company had quit MotoGP and endurance races in 2022, shifting focus to electric tech. This exit hurt morale. Racing had long boosted Suzuki’s global reputation, even aiding their car brand.

In 2023, Suzuki considered re-entry using carbon-neutral tech. They emphasized feedback for mass production, a past weakness. Shinichi Sahara, with MotoGP experience, led the project. The team mixed veterans with newcomers from various company divisions.

They used sustainable fuel and parts, aiming to match conventional racing performance. Time was tight—less than three months. They faced challenges integrating eco-friendly components and training inexperienced members.

Sustainable fuels, mixed with bio-based materials, showed promise for future use in cars and boats. Despite hurdles, the team learned valuable lessons from rapid problem-solving.
