Takeda Pharmaceutical, a Japanese drugmaker, plans to seek U.S. approval for its dengue vaccine. CEO Christophe Weber disclosed this move, aiming to break into the American vaccine market dominated by U.S. and European companies.

Dengue, a mosquito-borne virus, infects nearly 400 million people annually. Its spread is exacerbated by global warming. Takeda’s vaccine is notable as it is safe for children aged four and up, with minimal serious side effects. The World Health Organization endorses its use.

Takeda already sells the vaccine in Southeast Asia and Europe. They previously sought U.S. approval but withdrew. Now, they anticipate global sales reaching $2 billion annually.

Vaccines are crucial for medical economic security. During COVID-19, the U.S. boosted domestic vaccine production using the Defense Production Act, which grants the president emergency control over industries. Europe also restricted vaccine exports at one point.

Takeda focuses on developing vaccines for various infections, aiming to make vaccines a profit center alongside prescription drugs. Wider vaccine use could boost profits, funding further vaccine development and enhancing Japan’s competitiveness in the global vaccine market.
