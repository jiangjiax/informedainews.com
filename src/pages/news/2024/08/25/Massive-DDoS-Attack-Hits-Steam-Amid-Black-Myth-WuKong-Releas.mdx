On August 24, Steam experienced a massive DDoS attack. Nearly 60 botnets bombarded the platform, increasing attack commands by 20,000 times. The assault targeted Steam servers in 13 countries, with 280,000 attack commands detected. Such a coordinated attack is uncommon.

The attack occurred concurrently with the release of "Black Myth: WuKong," which quadrupled Steam's popularity. The timing and scale indicate a well-organized, targeted effort.
