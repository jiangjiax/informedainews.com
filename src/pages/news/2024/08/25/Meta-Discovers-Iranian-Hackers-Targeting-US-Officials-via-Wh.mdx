Meta, the company behind WhatsApp, recently blocked several accounts linked to Iranian hackers. These accounts were targeting officials from both Biden's and Trump's teams. The hackers, known as APT42, are suspected of being state-sponsored. They attempted to deceive individuals by posing as tech support for major companies such as AOL and Microsoft. Meta is collaborating with law enforcement to thwart their activities. This development occurs as the U.S. approaches another major election, heightening concerns about digital security and potential interference.
