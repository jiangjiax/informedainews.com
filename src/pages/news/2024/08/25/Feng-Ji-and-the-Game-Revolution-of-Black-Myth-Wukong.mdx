Feng Ji, having once written a 10,000-word manifesto titled "Who Killed Our Games" out of disappointment with the gaming industry, later joined Tencent and participated in the project for "Battle God." Eventually, due to conflicts between his ideals and reality, he left and founded Game Science. Determined to create a highly immersive single-player game, "Black Myth: Wu Kong," he faced challenges with funding and talent but ultimately attracted significant attention and resources with a trailer.

"Black Myth: Wu Kong" successfully launched, becoming the first domestic AAA single-player game, offering rare emotional value and fulfilling players' long-awaited expectations for a homegrown AAA game. Although its commercial achievements do not yet match those of mobile games, the emotional value it provides is even more precious.

Feng Ji's silence contrasts with the game's popularity, and the plagiarism accusations he faces have also drawn attention. His story, much like Sun Wukong in "Journey to the West," endures trials and tribulations to achieve success, but also foreshadows new challenges.
