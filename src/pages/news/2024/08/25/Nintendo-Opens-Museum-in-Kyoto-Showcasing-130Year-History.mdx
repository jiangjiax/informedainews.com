Nintendo's museum opens in Kyoto on October 2. Located in a 1969 factory, it chronicles the company's 130-year history from hanafuda cards to video games.

The second floor features every Nintendo game and early products such as diazo copy machines and baby strollers. A notable exhibit showcases the evolution of graphics in iconic series like Super Mario and The Legend of Zelda.

The first floor offers eight interactive experiences, including a giant controller experiment for two players. A central floor display allows visitors to play Hyakunin Isshu, a traditional Japanese card game.

Admission fees vary by age, with tickets available via reservation and lottery. The museum includes a cafe, workshops for custom hanafuda cards, and a gift shop.

Founded in 1889, Nintendo has expanded beyond games to Universal Studios Japan, where Super Nintendo World is a major attraction. A new Donkey Kong zone is set to open within 2024.

Nintendo plans to announce its next console by March.
