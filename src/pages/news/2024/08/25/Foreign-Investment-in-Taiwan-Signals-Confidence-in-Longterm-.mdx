Foreign investors, not armchair analysts, bet big on Taiwan's peace. Over $25 billion poured in last seven years. Tech giants like Nvidia and AMD lead, with over $6 billion since 2018. Nvidia plans a Taipei AI center, hiring 1,000 engineers.

Beyond tech, Japan's Mitsui Fudosan and others invest heavily in property and retail. Mitsui's Taipei shopping center costs $1.43 billion.

Renewable energy sees significant foreign cash. Wind and solar projects attract over $9 billion. European firms like Orsted and financial giants like CDPQ invest. CDPQ, managing $313.9 billion, backs Taiwan's wind farms.

These investments signal confidence in Taiwan's stability. Despite tensions with China, foreign firms see long-term peace. Their bets boost Taiwan's economy and domestic confidence.
