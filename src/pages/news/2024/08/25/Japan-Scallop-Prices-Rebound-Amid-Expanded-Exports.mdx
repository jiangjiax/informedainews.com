Japan's scallop prices have rebounded as China's ban took a toll, but exports surged to other markets. The U.S., Canada, Thailand, and Vietnam experienced significant increases. Domestic demand also grew, aided by government initiatives.

Tamarei, or flash-frozen scallops, are a favorite in sushi and tempura. Prices at Toyosu Market rose by 30% year-on-year. Tokyo fish shops now sell sashimi at rates approaching pre-ban levels.

Japan's scallop exports fell by 37% in the first half of 2024, but new markets helped offset losses. JETRO is focused on integrating scallops into global cuisines to cultivate long-term demand.

Hokkaido's scallop season began robustly, but shortages are anticipated due to escalating overseas demand. High prices are impacting their use in processed foods. Local businesses are adapting, though costs are straining them.

Diversification is crucial for Japan's fisheries. The goal is to reach 1.2 trillion yen in marine exports by 2030, with scallops playing a leading role.
