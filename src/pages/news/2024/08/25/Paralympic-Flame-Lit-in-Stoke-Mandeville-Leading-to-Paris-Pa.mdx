The Paralympic flame was lit in Stoke Mandeville, the birthplace of the Paralympics. This signifies the lead-up to the Paris Paralympics, which open on Wednesday. The games originated here in 1948, initially as a rehabilitation program for WWII wounded.

Andrew Parsons, President of the International Paralympic Committee, emphasized the event's global impact and viewership. Two British Paralympic medalists lit the flame, with Parsons serving as the first torchbearer.

The torch will journey across France, dividing into 12 flames, which will unite in Paris on the opening day. The games will last 12 days, concluding on September 8. Over 1.75 million tickets have been sold, mostly in France, with many events nearly sold out. The recent Paris Olympics likely heightened interest in the Paralympics.
