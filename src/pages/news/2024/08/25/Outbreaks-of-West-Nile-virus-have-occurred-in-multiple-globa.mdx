The West Nile virus outbreak has spread to multiple regions worldwide, with cases reported in Israel, Canada, the United States, and Spain. This summer alone, Israel has seen 858 infections and at least 62 deaths. The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and can cause symptoms such as fever and encephalitis, which can be fatal in severe cases. Currently, there are no specific drugs or vaccines available, and preventive measures include eliminating mosquitoes and preventing them from entering indoor spaces.

The West Nile virus was first identified in 1937 in Uganda, Africa, and is commonly found in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and West Asia. The virus has a complex pathogenic mechanism, making vaccine development challenging. Professor Zhao Wei from Southern Medical University notes that China has a wide distribution of Culex mosquitoes, posing an importation risk. He advises residents to avoid traveling to affected areas and to take mosquito-repellent measures when necessary.

It is important to note that many vector-borne diseases, such as dengue virus and Japanese encephalitis virus, lack specific treatments and can only be managed symptomatically. Professor Zhao Wei reminds that the West Nile virus is primarily transmitted by Culex mosquitoes, which are most active during dawn and dusk. Therefore, it is advisable to avoid going outdoors during these times.
