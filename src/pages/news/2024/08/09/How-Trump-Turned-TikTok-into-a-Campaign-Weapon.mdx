Trump once sought to ban TikTok, but now it has become a campaign weapon. In just two months, he has amassed nearly ten million followers, far surpassing his rivals. His team views it as a secret weapon to attract young voters, aiming to portray Trump as the "number one celebrity entertainer on Earth."

TikTok strategy: Avoid deep policy discussions, focus on behind-the-scenes footage, and showcase a human side. The videos are short and punchy, designed to amplify spontaneous humor and charisma. The team analyzes data, tracks viral moments, and hires TikTok experts to optimize content.

Trump's TikTok account has garnered over 500 million views. His campaign team calls it "the most successful entry in political history," emphasizing Trump's authenticity and charm.

Despite continued Republican attacks on TikTok, Trump's inner circle encourages its use. The number of pro-Trump posts on TikTok is twice that of Biden's. Although the Biden team is working hard, they lag far behind in followers and engagement.

Trump's first TikTok video received nearly 170 million views. Subsequent videos may not have replicated the explosive viewership but remain popular. The team disseminates videos via email, highlighting their popularity.

After Harris joined TikTok, her engagement soared, challenging Trump's dominance. Trump's team strives to maintain their advantage, but Harris's team seems to have gained the upper hand.

Trump leverages the influence of sports and internet celebrities to mobilize young male voters. Collaborations with golf player DeChambeau and video game streamer Ninja have garnered high attention.

Trump explicitly states that saving TikTok is an electoral strategy, urging TikTok users to vote for him. A live video reached 27 million views, with commenters expressing their admiration.

TikTok has become the nerve center of American political debates, with the boundaries between political leaders and influencers blurring. In the social media landscape,争夺关注度与相关性至关重要.
