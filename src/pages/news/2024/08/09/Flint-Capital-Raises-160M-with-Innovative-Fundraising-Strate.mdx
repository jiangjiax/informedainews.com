Flint Capital, based in Boston, has raised $160 million. This marks their third fund, which is quadruple the size of their 2013 debut. They concentrate on early and late-stage technology, cybersecurity, fintech, and digital health startups.

Dmitry Smirnov, one of the founders, took an unconventional route. Rather than seeking traditional investors such as pension funds, he focused on IT entrepreneurs. Smirnov was convinced that these tech leaders would be eager to invest in the next wave of innovation.

Flint also casts a global net, particularly in Europe and Israel, but remains committed to the potential of the U.S. market. They have backed successful companies like Socure, WalkMe, and Flo, all of which have reached billion-dollar valuations.

Andrew Gershfeld observed that some investors were former founders backed by Flint. This reinvestment was a testament to Flint's successful strategy.

Despite a challenging fundraising environment, Flint was able to secure the necessary funds. Over the past year, they have supported Israeli startups during the Gaza conflict. Gribov witnessed these companies flourish, reinforcing Flint's global approach.
