Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone shattered her own 400m hurdles world record, clocking 50.37 seconds for Olympic gold. This marks her sixth record-breaking performance in the event. She topped Dutch runner Femke Bol and USA's Anna Cockrell, who took silver and bronze, respectively.

McLaughlin-Levrone is set to compete in the 4x400m relay, aiming for her third Olympic gold. She's the first American to defend an individual track gold since Michael Johnson in the 400m.

In other events, Noah Lyles and Kenny Bednarek secured bronze and silver in the 200m, with Botswana's Letsile Tebogo winning gold. Grant Holloway added another gold for Team USA in the men's 110m hurdles.
