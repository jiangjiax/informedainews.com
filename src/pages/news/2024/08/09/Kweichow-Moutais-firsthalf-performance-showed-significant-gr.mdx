Kweichow Moutai's first-half performance was impressive. Revenue reached 81.931 billion yuan, up 17.76%; net profit was 41.696 billion yuan, up 15.88%. Moutai liquor sales amounted to 68.567 billion yuan, and series liquor sales were 13.147 billion yuan. Through the "iMoutai" platform, alcohol sales excluding tax reached 10.25 billion yuan. Total assets stood at 279.207 billion yuan, up 2.39%.

The stock price rose by 1.82%, and the balance of cash and equivalents was 145.267 billion yuan. A three-year dividend plan was announced, with annual dividends not less than 75% of net profit. Advance receipts at the end of June were 11.2 billion yuan, indicating the ability to navigate through cycles.

Experts say Moutai's market price is rising steadily, and the dividend plan enhances shareholder cohesion. The fundamental demand for Moutai liquor remains unchanged, and the company is confident in navigating through this cycle.
