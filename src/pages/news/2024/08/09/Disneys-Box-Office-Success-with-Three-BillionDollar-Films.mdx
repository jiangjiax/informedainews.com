Disney's box office is roaring back in 2024. "Inside Out 2" leads the charge, now the top-grossing animated film ever, surpassing $1.5 billion globally. "Deadpool & Wolverine," an R-rated Marvel flick, smashed opening weekend records and is on track to hit $1 billion.

"Moana 2" is next, expected to capitalize on the original's streaming success and hit theaters over Thanksgiving. "Mufasa: The Lion King," a prequel to the 2019 blockbuster, is a December wildcard.

Disney's strategy extends beyond films. Hits like these bolster theme parks, merchandise, and TV shows. The company's recent struggles, including a dip in theme park revenue and criticism over content quality, are being addressed.

CEO Bob Iger attributes the turnaround to a focus on quality over quantity and a renewed emphasis on the theatrical experience. Disney's resilience is evident; it has produced more billion-dollar hits than any other studio.
