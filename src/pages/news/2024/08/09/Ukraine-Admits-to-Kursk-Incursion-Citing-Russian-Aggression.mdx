In its first official admission, Ukraine justified its incursion into Russia's Kursk region. Mykhailo Podolyak, a top aide to President Zelenskiy, cited Russia's "unequivocal aggression" as the root cause. He added, "War is war, with its own rules, where the aggressor inevitably reaps corresponding outcomes."

Fighting escalated near Korenevo and Sudzha, with Ukrainian forces reportedly in control of parts of Sudzha. Russia declared a state of emergency in Kursk, evacuating 3,000 civilians.

Russian military bloggers, often the most reliable sources, detailed the conflict. Ukraine's advance, using infantry, armor, drones, and electronic warfare, surprised Moscow. President Putin, visibly angry, convened his security council.

Experts remain divided on the strategic value of the incursion. Jade McGlynn, a Ukraine expert, noted its success as a political strategy, undermining claims of Russia's invincibility.

The US, unaware of Ukraine's plans, reiterated its policy restricting high-value weapon use within Russia's borders. The main gas pipeline to Europe runs near Sudzha, but Ukraine has allowed gas flow to continue, adhering to a contract expiring in 2024.
