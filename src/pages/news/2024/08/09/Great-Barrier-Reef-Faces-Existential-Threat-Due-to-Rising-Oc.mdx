Ocean temperatures at the Great Barrier Reef have reached 400-year highs. Scientists attribute this to greenhouse gases emitted by fossil fuels. The reef is under an "existential threat." Swift reductions in emissions are essential. Without them, the reef's destruction is imminent. The World Heritage committee postponed labeling the reef "in danger" until 2026.
