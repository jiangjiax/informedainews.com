Austrian police arrested a 19-year-old suspect and two others for planning an Islamist attack at a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna. Chemicals and technical devices found in the suspect's home indicated bomb-making intentions. The plot led to the cancellation of Swift's three-night run at Ernst Happel stadium, affecting over 170,000 fans.

The suspect had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State and stolen chemicals from his former employer. Reports suggest he planned to use a car, machetes, and knives in the attack. Austrian authorities, with help from foreign intelligence, thwarted the plot, though an abstract danger remains.

Taylor Swift has yet to comment. Fans will receive refunds, and there are no plans to reschedule the Vienna shows. Swift's tour continues, with upcoming dates in London's Wembley stadium. UK authorities are monitoring the situation.
