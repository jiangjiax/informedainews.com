Grant Smith, a security researcher, uncovered a smishing scam masquerading as USPS. Scammers deceived victims into divulging credit card details through counterfeit websites. Smith infiltrated the scammers' systems, collected evidence, and collaborated with USPS and a major US bank to safeguard 438,669 unique credit cards.

Smishing is a type of phishing that employs text messages to mislead.

The scam encompassed 1,133 domains, capturing over 50,000 email addresses and 1.2 million data points. Victims were spread across the U.S., with California being the most severely affected. The scam likely extends beyond what Smith discovered, potentially connected to similar frauds in various countries.
