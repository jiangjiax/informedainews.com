Disney plans to double its cruise fleet by 2031, with the expansion targeting Asian markets to boost theme park business growth.

At a recent fan event, Disney announced plans to build four new ships by 2031, which will increase their fleet to 13 vessels. Disney cruises are known for their themed entertainment, dining, and activities inspired by popular movies.

Currently, Disney cruises mainly depart from U.S. ports, offering itineraries ranging from two to three nights up to two weeks. Destinations include the Caribbean, Hawaii, and Europe. Prices for a four-night cruise in 2025 start at $2,196 per person, covering meals, room service, and shows.

The cruise business is expanding to Asia, with the Disney Adventure ship set to start service from Singapore in 2025, targeting Southeast Asia. Oriental Land, operator of Tokyo Disney Resort, will operate a new Disney cruise ship by 2029, aiming for 400,000 annual passengers and 100 billion yen in revenue.

Disney's Parks, Experiences and Products segment, which includes cruises, plays a significant role in the company's operating profit. However, inflation and higher costs are impacting this segment.

Cruises offer flexibility in location and attractions, potentially driving growth. Disney's cruise business, originally targeting retirees, now attracts younger customers, presenting a growth opportunity.
