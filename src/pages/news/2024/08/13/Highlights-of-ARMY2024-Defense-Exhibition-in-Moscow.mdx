ARMY-2024, Russia's major defense exhibition, kicked off in Moscow. Representatives from 83 countries attended, featuring over 20,000 pieces of military equipment and gadgets from 1,000 companies.

The showcase spotlighted advancements in drones, electronic warfare, and enhanced armor. The Lancet-E, a new drone, is capable of striking targets on both land and sea. Ground drones like Depecha and Buggy can stealthily approach enemies and resupply troops.

Smaller drones such as Mangust and Argus-D serve different purposes: one for land inspections, the other for deep-sea missions. Octavis is a docking station for underwater drones, improving their management.

The BTR-22 is an upgraded armored vehicle, offering enhanced protection against bullets and mines. The Plastun series provides lighter, more agile troop carriers.

Russia's defense minister emphasized that modern, precise weapons are crucial in contemporary warfare. Russian arms manufacturers appear to concur, focusing on the development of new technologies and upgrades.
