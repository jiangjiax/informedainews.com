Pakistan's army arrested Faiz Hameed, the former chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), on August 13, 2024. Hameed, a retired Lieutenant General, is facing a military court martial for a property case and banned political activities post-retirement. This marks the first arrest of a former ISI chief in Pakistan's history.

The ISI, known for its significant political influence, has often been linked to the rise and fall of governments. Hameed's arrest signals a strict adherence to military laws and serves as a warning to politicians, including jailed ex-Prime Minister Imran Khan, that no one is above the law.

Hameed was involved in a land development scandal, accused of orchestrating a raid on a housing company executive's properties. His association with Khan, who was ousted in 2022 and arrested in 2023 on graft and state secrets charges, further complicates the political landscape.

Khan's supporters reacted violently to Hameed's arrest, attacking military installations. The army holds Khan responsible for these attacks, demanding an apology, which he has refused. Hameed's trial serves as a stark reminder to Khan and his allies of the military's resolve.
