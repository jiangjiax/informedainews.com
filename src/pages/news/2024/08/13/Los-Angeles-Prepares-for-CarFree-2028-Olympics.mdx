Los Angeles prepares for the 2028 Olympics with a vision of "no-car Games." Mayor Karen Bass intends to exclusively use public transit, leasing 3,000 buses. The city, famous for its car culture, aims to construct a more sustainable future.

This will be LA's third time hosting the Olympics, following the events in 1932 and 1984. Preparations involve expanding hotel capacity and renovating venues. Bass also plans to promote remote work during the Games.

Tackling homelessness is a significant challenge. LA has over 45,000 homeless individuals, a higher rate than in other major US cities. Bass is dedicated to providing both temporary and permanent housing solutions.

The city is under pressure to enhance its offerings, particularly after Paris's successful pre-Olympics relocations. LA28 chairperson Casey Wasserman describes the flag handover from Paris to LA as "the biggest moment in LA28 history to date."
