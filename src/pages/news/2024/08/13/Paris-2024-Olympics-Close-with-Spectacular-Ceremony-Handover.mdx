Paris 2024 Olympics closed with a vibrant ceremony at Stade de France. The event was a blend of joy and spectacle, marking the end of 19 days of competition. The ceremony featured traditional elements like the passing of the Olympic flame to Los Angeles for 2028, highlighted by Tom Cruise's dramatic entrance.

The ceremony was more than a spectacle; it was a celebration of unity and sportsmanship. Athletes from around the world participated in a heartwarming procession. The event also showcased French culture through performances and music, including a standout act by a French Cambodian rapper.

The closing speech by Tony Estanguet, chairman of the Paris committee, emphasized the Games' role in fostering unity and joy. Despite the theatrics, the underlying message was clear: these Games were about more than sport; they were about coming together.

As the flame was passed to Los Angeles, the ceremony reminded us of the enduring spirit of the Olympicsâ€”a beacon of hope and unity in a chaotic world.
