Scientists at Shanghai Jiao Tong University have developed a new approach to cancer treatment. They've created an "artificial metabzyme," mimicking a natural enzyme called xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR). This new tool tweaks tumor cell metabolism, triggering an immune response that targets cancer cells specifically.

Traditional cancer treatments often cause side effects and drug resistance. This new method, detailed in Nature Nanotechnology, uses the tumor's own metabolic changes to signal immune cells, enhancing their ability to attack the cancer.

The team, led by Professors Ling Daishun and Li Fangyuan, synthesized a catalyst called FeMoO4. This catalyst acts like XOR, but with precision targeting capabilities. It alters the metabolism of tumor cells, producing signals that activate nearby immune cells, turning them against the cancer.

This research opens new avenues for treating not just cancer, but other diseases linked to metabolic abnormalities. The potential for personalized, targeted treatments is significant, marking a shift in how we approach disease management.
