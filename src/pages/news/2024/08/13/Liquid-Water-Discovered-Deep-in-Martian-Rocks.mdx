NASA's Insight lander discovered liquid water deep within Mars' crust. The lander, operational from 2018 to 2022, utilized a seismometer to detect Mars quakes, uncovering seismic signals indicative of water. This marks the first direct evidence of liquid water on Mars, located at depths ranging from 10 to 20 kilometers.

This discovery provides insight into the fate of Mars' ancient water. While some of it evaporated into space, a significant portion likely remains buried underground. This finding poses challenges for Mars colonization plans, as accessing this water would necessitate deep drilling into the planet's crust.

The existence of liquid water deep beneath the surface could also suggest potential habitats for life, indicating that future Mars missions may concentrate on exploring these subterranean environments.
