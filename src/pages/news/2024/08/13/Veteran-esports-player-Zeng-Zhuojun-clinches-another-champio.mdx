Zeng Zhuojun, known as "Kid," at 35, is a veteran of esports who has claimed victory once again. He won the championship in "Street Fighter 6" at the 2024 Esports World Cup, overcoming numerous hardships. Transitioning from "The King of Fighters" to "Street Fighter," he has moved forward amidst doubts.

Zeng Zhuojun, nicknamed "Kid," started playing games at the age of six. He has already become a legend in the "King of Fighters" realm. In 2017, SNK awarded him the title of "China's King of Fighters Player Mentor." However, he chose to challenge himself by venturing into "Street Fighter."

When he first entered the "Street Fighter" scene, he faced skepticism and exclusion. He frequently changed characters and couldn't find his "main." No one in domestic training matches was willing to play against him, and he was mocked as a "poor player" abroad.

But "Kid" did not give up. After winning the EWC, he answered all the doubts. From "King of Fighters" to "Street Fighter," he has become a dual champion, truly deserving the title.

Esports is残酷, with players racing against time. Zeng Zhuojun, confident and arrogant, remains undefeated to this day. He has proven that age is not an obstacle; persistence and strength are the key.
