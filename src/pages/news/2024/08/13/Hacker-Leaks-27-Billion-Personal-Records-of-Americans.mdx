A hacker forum leaked nearly 2.7 billion personal records of Americans, including names, social security numbers, addresses, and aliases. The data was allegedly obtained from a company that collects and sells personal information for background checks and investigations. The company, National Public Data, reportedly gathers this data from public sources to create individual profiles. Threat actors have claimed to have stolen 2.9 billion records from the company, including data from the US, UK, and Canada. The leaked information, totaling 277GB, includes unencrypted records of deceased individuals and their personal details. This breach has led to lawsuits against Jerico Pictures, believed to be associated with National Public Data. Residents in the US are advised to monitor their credit reports and be cautious of phishing attempts due to the sensitive nature of the leaked data.
