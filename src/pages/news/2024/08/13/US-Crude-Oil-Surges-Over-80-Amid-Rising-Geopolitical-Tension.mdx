U.S. crude oil surged over 4% to surpass $80 per barrel as the Pentagon deployed more forces to the Middle East amid fears of an Iranian attack on Israel. Defense Secretary Austin ordered a carrier strike group and a guided-missile submarine to the region. Israel is on high alert following the assassination of a Hamas leader in Tehran. Despite OPEC lowering its demand growth forecast, oil prices rose due to heightened geopolitical tensions. Analysts recommend adding oil and gold to portfolios for protection. The market remains on track for a deficit as inventories decline. Last week, U.S. crude oil rebounded after a 4-week decline, driven by market recovery and interest rate adjustments.
