Shanghai Fudan Microelectronics Group developed RFID cards with a backdoor, making them easy to clone and capable of unlocking doors globally. Quarkslab discovered this vulnerability. Attackers require only brief proximity to the card. In supply chain attacks, cloning could occur instantly on a massive scale.

RFID stands for Radio-Frequency Identification, a technology using radio waves to read and capture information stored on a tag attached to an object. It is commonly used in access control cards.
