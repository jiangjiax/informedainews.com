Warming in the Bering Sea has wiped out snow crab populations. NOAA scientists link this to climate change, noting a 200-fold increase in extreme conditions since preindustrial times. Arctic warming, four times faster than the global average, threatens not just crabs but other marine life too. Alaska's fishing industry reels from the loss. This is a preview of broader ecological shifts as the planet heats up.
