Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, faces a French court after being arrested at Le Bourget airport. He is accused of failing to curb criminal activities on his messaging app, which includes fraud, drug trafficking, and the promotion of terrorism.

Durov, a Russian-born billionaire, left Russia in 2014, evading Kremlin demands to suppress VK opposition groups. He then focused on Telegram, which evolved from a simple messaging app into a social network, hosting groups of up to 200,000 members and broadcast channels.

Telegram, with its 950 million monthly users, plays a crucial role in disseminating both information and misinformation about Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine. Its robust encryption has attracted extremists and conspiracy theorists.

Durov resides in Dubai, praising its business-friendly, neutral environment. Western governments are pressuring Telegram to moderate illegal content, unlike in the UAE.

The app is popular among Ukrainian leaders and Russian citizens seeking unfiltered war news. Critics, including anti-racism groups, label Telegram a hub for extremists and hate speech.

Durov advocates for Telegram as a neutral platform, resisting government interference. His arrest underscores the ongoing battle between tech freedom and regulatory control.
