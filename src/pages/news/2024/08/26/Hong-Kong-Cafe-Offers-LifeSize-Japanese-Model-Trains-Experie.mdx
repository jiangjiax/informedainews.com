The Hara Cafe in Hong Kong's Tsim Sha Tsui district offers a taste of 1920s Japan through life-size replicas of vintage train cars. These mock-ups, based on models by the late Nobutaro Hara, a renowned model railroad enthusiast, include a 1919 Hakone Tozan railway car and a 1921 Hanshin Electric Railway vehicle.

The original models are displayed at the Hara Model Railway Museum in Yokohama, Japan, which also houses railroad memorabilia and detailed dioramas. George Hara, Nobutaro's son and museum director, has previously declined to exhibit these fragile models abroad. However, the Hong Kong cafe allows international audiences to experience their charm without leaving the city.

Inside the cafe, guests dine within the vintage carriages, enjoying virtual scenic views of Japanese landscapes, including Mount Fuji. This unique dining experience provides a nostalgic journey back in time, all within the bustling heart of Hong Kong.
