Reddit, which has been public for six months, attracts advertisers by avoiding the use of user data. Instead, it targets ads based on interests by leveraging its network of over 100,000 subreddits. This strategy has significantly boosted sales, with the company's stock rising 66% since its IPO.

Reddit's "conversation ads" align products with user queries within specific subreddits, such as displaying water bottle ads in r/HydroHomies. These ads represent Reddit's fastest-growing format.

Since 2018, Reddit has concentrated on advertising, highlighting its content moderation as a safer option for brands. With over 60,000 volunteer moderators and a user voting system, Reddit ensures high-quality content.

These improvements have led to partnerships with major sports leagues like the NFL, NBA, and MLB. Fortune 500 companies are the primary contributors to Reddit's ad revenue, which reached nearly $800 million last year. Analysts forecast $1.1 billion in ad revenue for this year, with a goal of reaching $2 billion by 2027.

Reddit heavily relies on a few top advertisers, underscoring the need to attract smaller marketers. With over 90 million daily users, Reddit presents a promising platform for advertising investment.
