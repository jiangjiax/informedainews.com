Paraclete Energy, a Michigan-based company, has developed a new silicon-based anode material called SILO Silicon™. This material could significantly boost the energy density of lithium-ion batteries, crucial for electric vehicles and renewable energy storage.

Traditional lithium-ion batteries use graphite as the anode, limiting their energy density to about 250Wh/kg. SILO Silicon™, with a silicon content of 83%, aims to raise this to 520Wh/kg, tripling the energy density. This increase allows electric vehicles to travel over 1000 kilometers on a single charge.

The challenge with silicon anodes has been their tendency to expand during charging, risking battery failure. Paraclete Energy's solution involves encapsulating silicon particles in polymer microspheres, controlling expansion to under 4%. This design also enhances ion conductivity and stabilizes the electrode's surface, addressing key issues in silicon anode technology.

Scheduled for release in late 2024, SILO Silicon™ promises faster charging times and lower costs, potentially revolutionizing the electric vehicle market by making longer ranges and quicker charges more affordable.
