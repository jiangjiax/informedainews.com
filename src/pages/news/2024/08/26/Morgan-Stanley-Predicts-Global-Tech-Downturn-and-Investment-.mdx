Morgan Stanley predicts a tech downturn in 2025. The bank cites slowing revenue growth and tight supply-demand conditions as triggers. Semiconductor materials and AI supply chains face the brunt due to price volatility and high operating costs.

The bank advises focusing on quality stocks with strong cash flows and low valuations. Companies that fared well during past recessions are recommended. Morgan Stanley also highlights tech areas with defensive, countercyclical, and growth potential.

Key stocks mentioned include Nvidia, Apple, Seagate, Dell, and Arista Networks. Nvidia, despite its high position in the AI market, is seen as resilient. Apple and others in IT hardware are expected to sustain their cycles. Arista Networks is favored for its high-performance networking capabilities in AI.

Global picks include Samsung Electronics, TSMC, and Quanta. Samsung and TSMC are noted for their stability and defensive qualities during downturns. Quanta, a laptop maker, is praised for its strong balance sheet and growing exposure to AI infrastructure.
