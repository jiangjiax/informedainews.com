Iranian hackers, known as APT42 or CharmingKitten, targeted Trump's campaign. They specialize in mobile surveillance, recording calls, stealing texts, and activating cameras and microphones. Linked to Iran's Intelligence Organization of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC-IO), they focus on high-value targets in Washington and Israel.

APT42 uses mobile malware for detailed surveillance, including geolocation data. They impersonate journalists and think tanks via email, aiming to trick targets into opening malicious messages. Targets include anti-Iran activists, reporters, academics, and foreign-policy advisers.

In 2018, they targeted nuclear workers and U.S. Treasury officials during the U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA. APT42 continues to target campaign officials and former Trump administration figures critical of Iran.
