In South Korea, the birth rate has plummeted to 0.76, with just 60,000 births in the first quarter of 2024. This decline mirrors trends in Japan and Spain, where low fertility rates reflect a broader global shift in attitudes towards parenthood.

Young adults now approach childbirth with caution, influenced by economic pressures and societal changes. The concept of "birth consent" has emerged, suggesting that unborn children should have a say in their arrival. This idea challenges traditional views on the rights of parents versus the rights of the unborn.

The article explores the complexities of this debate through the fictional scenario of "birth consent" checks, where fetuses are asked if they wish to be born. This raises profound questions about autonomy and the nature of life itself.

Economic factors, including high housing costs and education expenses, contribute to the reluctance to have children. Social media and cultural shifts also play roles, with discussions about the hardships of parenting influencing public opinion.

The article concludes by questioning the authenticity of our choices in life, whether influenced by external factors or genuine free will. It suggests that the decision to have children, like many life choices, is complex and multifaceted.
