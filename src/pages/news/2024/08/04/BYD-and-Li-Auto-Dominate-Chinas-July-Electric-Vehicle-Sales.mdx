In July, China's top two electric vehicle manufacturers, BYD and Li Auto, dominated sales, capturing over half of the market. BYD sold over 340,000 units, a record high, while Li Auto reached 51,000 units, its best performance to date.

The industry was abuzz with discussions on "internal competition" and weekly sales rankings, but the spotlight remained on these leading companies. BYD expanded its DM-i lineup and reduced prices on the Fang程豹, leading to protests from early buyers. Li Auto introduced system upgrades that enhanced safety and driving aids.

Other players such as NIO, Xpeng, and Geely experienced mixed results. Geely's Zeekr saw a decline after two strong months, while Xpeng and NIO maintained steady sales, with NIO unveiling new technology like its SkyOS system.

The market is consolidating around a few key brands, leaving less space for others. BYD and Li Auto's dominance highlights a trend towards concentration in China's EV market.
