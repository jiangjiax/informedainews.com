Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy and other investors are scouting university founders for climate tech startups. Molten Industries, a company that breaks down methane without CO2 emissions, began in a Stanford professor's garage.

Breakthrough Energy Catalyst supports early-stage founders with grants of up to $500,000. They have backed 42 climate tech companies, which have collectively raised $250 million.

Venture capitalists are moving earlier, betting on proto-companiesâ€”ideas that could become businesses. Azolla Ventures funds graduate students to scout for overlooked projects.

The Collaborative Fund provided Harvard's Wyss Institute with $15 million to research sustainable materials, aiming to bridge the gap from lab to market.

Breakthrough Energy's business fellows assist founders in navigating intellectual property and industry connections. For example, Molten Industries pivoted from burying carbon to using it in batteries with their support.

Investors stepping in early improve startups' chances of transitioning from idea to reality.
