The U.S. Justice Department is suing TikTok and ByteDance, accusing them of failing to protect the privacy of children under 13, thereby violating the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). They are required to obtain parental consent for data collection. TikTok permitted underage users to create accounts, shared videos and messages with adults, and collected personal information without parental consent, affecting millions of American children.

The FTC is seeking penalties of up to $51,744 per violation per day. TikTok has been working with the FTC for over a year and is disappointed by the litigation. With 170 million U.S. users, TikTok faces potential divestiture or a ban and has already faced fines in the EU and U.K. over children's data.

A U.S. Senate bill proposes extending COPPA to cover those up to age 17, banning targeted ads to kids and teens, and allowing the deletion of information from social media. It requires House approval to become law.
