Cloud revenue reached $79 billion this quarter, a 22% increase from last year, driven by AI. Synergy Research predicts the market will double again in four years.

Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud, including Azure, fell short of analyst estimates but still grew by 30%. Amazon's revenue increased by 19%, maintaining a steady growth rate. Google Cloud surpassed $10 billion for the first time, up 29% year-over-year, gaining market share.

Market share distribution: Amazon leads with 32%, Microsoft follows with 23%, and Google holds 12%. Microsoft lost some share but continues strong growth, partly due to Azure's seasonal sales cycle.

Oracle tied with Salesforce at 3%, surpassing IBM. The top three companies control over 73% of the market.
