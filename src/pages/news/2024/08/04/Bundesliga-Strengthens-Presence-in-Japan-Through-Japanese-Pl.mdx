TOKYO â€” Peer Naubert, the chief marketing officer of Bundesliga International, views Japan as a pivotal market. The league has embraced 66 Japanese players, ranging from icons like Makoto Hasebe to emerging talents like Ritsu Doan.

Bundesliga's worldwide strategy hinges on local icons, essential for fostering brand recognition and enthusiasm in regions like Japan. Interest in the Bundesliga among Japanese audiences has surged by 26% since the 2022 World Cup, a rate more than twice the 9% rise in general soccer interest.

Satellite broadcaster Sky Perfect JSAT holds exclusive rights to Bundesliga matches. Audience numbers have increased, with "avid" fans tuning in more often than those of the Premier League or La Liga.

Stuttgart's trip to Japan features exhibition matches against Kyoto Sanga and Sanfrecce Hiroshima. Despite the lack of current Japanese stars, Naubert appreciates the contributions of Stuttgart's former players, including Okazaki and Endo.

The Bundesliga is set to establish a Japanese partnership starting in 2025. Naubert is optimistic about the responses from potential partners in a competitive market.
