Snoop Dogg's presence at the 2024 Paris Olympics boosted viewership. NBCUniversal's coverage averaged 34 million viewers over five days, up 79% from Tokyo 2021.

Snoop, known for his music, took on roles as commentator and entertainer. He interacted with athletes, tried sports, and offered analysis. Molly Solomon, NBC's Olympics executive producer, praised him as an "ambassador of happiness."

His activities, from carrying the Olympic torch to learning swimming from Michael Phelps, went viral. Snoop's appeal lies in his ability to connect with fans and athletes alike, bringing a fresh perspective to the Games.

NBCUniversal plans to keep Snoop involved, including a role on "The Voice" this fall. His integration into the Olympics aimed at attracting a broader, younger audience. Some traditional fans, however, felt his celebrity presence diluted the sports' seriousness.
