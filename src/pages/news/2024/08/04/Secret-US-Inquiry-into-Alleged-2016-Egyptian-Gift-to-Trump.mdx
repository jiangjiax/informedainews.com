Trump's spokesperson denies allegations of a $10m gift from Egypt's Sisi in 2016. The Washington Post reports a secret US investigation into the matter. Steven Cheung claims the probe found no wrongdoing and was closed.

The Post details a $10m withdrawal from Egypt's National Bank days before Trump's inauguration. US officials described the cash as heavy bags of $100 bills. Investigators discovered this in 2019, two years after initial CIA intelligence on Sisi's intent.

Such a foreign donation would break federal law. Trump's praise for Sisi raised eyebrows, given his authoritarian rule. The investigation faced scrutiny, notably from Attorney General William Barr, who appointed a prosecutor to close the case without charges.

The Post's report comes amid Trump's 2024 presidential bid and the bribery conviction of Senator Robert Menendez, who took Egyptian gold and cash. Menendez faces up to 222 years in prison.

The justice department and FBI declined to comment. The closing prosecutor, Michael Sherwin, stands by his decision. An anonymous source questions the justice department's handling of the case, suggesting a lack of thorough investigation.
