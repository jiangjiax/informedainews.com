PS5 Pro, a step up from the standard PS5, boasts significant performance boosts. Developers at the 2024 Gamescom revealed its specs: a faster GPU and memory. This upgrade promises a 45% leap in rendering speed and up to four times faster ray tracing, enhancing visual realism.

A custom machine learning setup, capable of 300TOPS at 8-bit operations, supports Sony's PSSR technology. Sony plans to unveil PS5 Pro details at the upcoming Tokyo Game Show, aiming for a November launch, mirroring the PS4 Pro's release strategy.
