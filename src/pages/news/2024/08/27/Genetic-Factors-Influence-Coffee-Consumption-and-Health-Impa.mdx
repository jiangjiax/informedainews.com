Coffee's impact on health hinges on your genes. Sandra Sanchez-Roige, a researcher at the University of California, San Diego, led a study comparing coffee habits in the U.S. and the U.K. using genetic data from 23andMe and the UK Biobank.

The study, published in Neuropsychopharmacology, found genetic links to coffee consumption. Specific gene mutations inherited from parents influence how much coffee one drinks.

However, the health effects of coffee remain unclear. The research showed mixed results: positive genetic associations with harmful outcomes like obesity and drug use, but also potential protective traits.

Differences in data collection methods and cultural preferences complicate the findings. For instance, the type of coffee consumed—instant in the U.K. versus ground in the U.S.—and the inclusion of sugar in American coffee affect results.

The study underscores the interplay between genetics and environment. A person's genetic makeup can lead to different behaviors and choices depending on their surroundings.

More research is needed to fully understand these interactions and their implications for health.
