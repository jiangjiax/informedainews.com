UN chief Guterres warns Pacific islands face grave danger from rising seas. He urges global action before it's too late.

Sea-surface temps in the south-west Pacific have risen three times faster than the global average since 1980. Marine heatwaves have doubled in frequency and intensified.

Last year, 34 hydrometeorological hazard events in the region led to over 200 deaths and affected 25 million people.

The climate crisis and sea-level rise are no longer distant threats, especially for small island developing states. Sea-level rise is caused by melting land ice and seawater expansion due to warming.

Guterres calls for a drastic slash in global emissions and a fast, fair phase-out of fossil fuels. He demands a massive increase in finance and support for vulnerable countries.

Civil-society groups urge Australia to step up and support Pacific neighbors. Australia's climate finance contributions are falling short of need.

Pacific communities endure severe climate impacts despite contributing the least to the crisis. The climate emergency deepens debt and gender inequality in the region.
