Prosecutors raided the residence of former Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je this morning as part of their investigation into the Core Pacific City corruption scandal. Ko initially refused to open the door, temporarily obstructing the search. Prosecutors did not issue a subpoena but directly went to Ko's residence to conduct a simultaneous search and interview.
The Core Pacific City case involves NT$450 million in bribes, with city councilor Angela Ying being bribed to pressure Ko's city government to increase the floor area ratio. Shen Ching-ching, Angela Ying, and Ying's assistant Wu Shun-min have already been detained.
Today's interrogation of Ko Wen-je will focus on confirming his illegal approval of the floor area ratio increase, which involves the crime of profiteering. Prosecutors will subsequently investigate the cash flow to explore potential corruption or unexplained wealth charges.

- Core Pacific City: A shopping mall in Taipei that was once a local landmark. It ceased operations in 2019 due to poor business, and the Wei Jing Group later obtained the redevelopment rights, planning urban renewal and construction of commercial and office buildings.
- Floor area ratio: The ratio of a building's total floor area to the size of the parcel of land upon which it is built, commonly used to measure land use density. In the Core Pacific City case, the ratio was increased from 392% to 840%, prompting public suspicion of improper benefits.
- Agency Against Corruption: Taiwan's prosecutorial agency responsible for anti-corruption and integrity-related investigations.
- Profiteering: Using one's official position to violate laws and regulations to obtain personal or others' benefits.
- Cash flow investigation: Investigating the movement of funds to determine if corruption or other illegal activities exist.
