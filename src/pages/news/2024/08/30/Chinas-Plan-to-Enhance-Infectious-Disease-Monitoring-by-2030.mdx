By 2030, China aims to establish a robust, intelligent system for early warning of infectious diseases. This system will enhance detection and response to new outbreaks, unknown illnesses, and key infectious threats. The plan involves integrating multiple data sources—clinical, laboratory, and environmental—to improve accuracy and speed.

This initiative, detailed in a joint directive by nine ministries, focuses on streamlining reporting, risk assessment, and information sharing among health authorities, other sectors, and medical institutions. It emphasizes collaboration and rapid adaptation to changing situations.

The goal is clear: to match or exceed global standards in disease surveillance and early warning.
