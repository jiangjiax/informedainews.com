China's recent export restrictions on rare metals such as antimony and gallium have caused prices to skyrocket. Antimony, used in flame retardants and solar cells, saw its price surge to $25,000 per tonne, more than doubling its value at the end of last year. Gallium, essential for semiconductors, experienced a 20% price increase within a month.

China holds a dominant position in the global production of these metals, accounting for 48% of antimony and over 90% of gallium. The introduction of new export licenses has raised concerns about potential supply shortages, prompting buyers to stockpile. Despite a slight recovery in exports, the market remains uneasy, anticipating further restrictions.

This action by China affects industries worldwide, from electronics to automotive, underscoring the global economy's reliance on Chinese mineral supplies. The uncertainty could encourage more countries to seek alternative sources or enhance their own production capabilities.
