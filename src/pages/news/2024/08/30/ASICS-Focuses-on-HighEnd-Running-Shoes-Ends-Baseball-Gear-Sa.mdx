ASICS, a Japanese sports brand, will halt sales of baseball gloves and bats in 2025. The company, renowned for providing equipment to MLB stars such as Ichiro Suzuki and Shohei Ohtani, is shifting its focus to high-end running shoes. This strategic move aims to capitalize on global demand and enhance profitability.

ASICS' recent financial success, marked by a 70% increase in net profit during the first half of 2024, highlights the potential of this strategy. The decision to concentrate on running shoes mirrors a broader trend in the sports industry towards specialized, high-margin products.
