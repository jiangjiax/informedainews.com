Google trains AI with 300 million audio clips—coughs, sniffles, labored breathing—to spot diseases like tuberculosis. They partner with Salcit Technologies, an Indian AI healthcare startup, aiming to integrate this tech into smartphones. The goal: assist high-risk groups in areas with limited healthcare access.

This isn't Google's first venture into digitizing human senses. They've previously invested in AI that detects diseases through scent.
