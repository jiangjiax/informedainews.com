Folder Hub accelerates file access on Macs by floating a Finder window, simplifying navigation across multiple monitors. Activate it using a shortcut or by moving the mouse to the screen's edge.

Highly praised, Folder Hub enhances productivity with a touch of enjoyment.

**Explanation:**
- **Finder window:** The default file management interface on Macs.
- **Multi-monitor setups:** Using more than one screen for computing.
- **Screen's edge:** Refers to the border of the screen, used here metaphorically.
