The Western Land-Sea Corridor, a vital logistics artery connecting China's western regions to the world, is transforming the fortunes of inland areas. Beginning in Chongqing, it traverses Guangxi and Yunnan, reaching global markets. Over the past five years, it has not only expedited cargo transport but also spurred robust economic growth along its route.

The opening of the corridor has addressed long-standing logistics challenges in the west. For instance, Yang Ming of Zun Cheng Supply Chain used to be troubled by lengthy transport times. Now, fresh produce from Southeast Asia can quickly reach western China, reducing the risk of spoilage.

Lemons from Tongnan, Chongqing, which once struggled to enter international markets, are now exported to over 30 countries via the new corridor. Similar stories are unfolding in Ningxia, Xinjiang, Guangxi, and Guizhou, where local specialty products are reaching the world through the new corridor.

The corridor has not only accelerated logistics but also driven industrial upgrades. For example, Chongqing Hua Feng Chemical's adipic acid, exported via the corridor, has seen a 20-day reduction in logistics time and cost savings, enhancing the company's market competitiveness and attracting more international clients.

Countries along the route have also benefited. Products like Thai longans, Laotian rice, and Vietnamese basa fish enter the Chinese market quickly through the corridor, reducing costs and improving competitiveness.

The Western Land-Sea Corridor is not just a logistics route; it is an international economic corridor that unleashes new momentum in China's west, offering new opportunities for沿线国家和地区带来了新机遇.
