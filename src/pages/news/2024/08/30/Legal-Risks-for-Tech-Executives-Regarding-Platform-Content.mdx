Tech executives are facing increasing legal risks related to content on their platforms. X closed its operations in Brazil following threats to its executives. Binance's Zhao pleaded guilty to money laundering charges. Twitter executives in India were threatened with arrest over takedowns requested by the government. Telegram's Durov was indicted in France for crimes on the platform, including child abuse imagery.

Traditionally, liability fell on companies, not individuals. U.S. law protected platforms from harm caused by users, thanks to Section 230. However, the standards are changing, particularly in areas of child safety. Britain's new legislation holds executives personally responsible for failing to remove content that endangers children.

Durov's indictment signifies a shift. His defiance of authority and Telegram's refusal to comply with French law enforcement have drawn intense scrutiny. Telegram claims that EU laws exempt platforms from responsibility for user abuse.

Meta has fought to exclude Zuckerberg from a child protection lawsuit. In authoritarian countries, U.S. tech firms strive to protect their employees to prevent being used as leverage by governments.

Previous cases have seen executives charged but ultimately acquitted. Executives like Somm of CompuServe, Koogle of Yahoo, and Dotcom of Megaupload faced legal challenges but avoided conviction.

It is difficult to prove that executives were aware of crimes on their platforms. Platforms such as TikTok and Meta actively report illegal content. Awareness remains crucial in determining whether immunity is lost.

Personal sanctions carry more weight than corporate fines, compelling executives to act responsibly.
