Zakia Khudadadi, a taekwondo fighter, won bronze at the Paris Paralympics. She's the first Refugee Paralympic Team medallist. Khudadadi, from Afghanistan, started taekwondo at 11, training in secret. The Taliban blocked her from competing in 2021, but international pressure allowed her to join the Tokyo Games.

After Tokyo, she moved to Paris. At the 2024 Paralympics, she fought for the Refugee Team, winning bronze in the women’s -47kg category. Her coach, Haby Niare, praised her resilience. Khudadadi hopes her win inspires refugees and promotes peace in Afghanistan.
