Lego plans to utilize renewable or recycled materials for half of its bricks by 2026, with a full transition by 2032. Despite facing higher costs and material challenges, the company promises not to increase prices. Currently, 22% of their bricks are free from fossil fuels. Lego is prepared to pay up to 70% more for certified renewable resin to enhance production. Additionally, Lego has extended its brick takeback program, Replay, to the UK, offering free shipping for donations.
