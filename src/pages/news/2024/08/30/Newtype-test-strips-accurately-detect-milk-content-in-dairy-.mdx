The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences has developed a new type of test strip capable of accurately detecting the milk content in dairy products. This technology utilizes a non-nucleic acid amplification molecular hybridization method, designing probes specifically for mitochondrial DNA to achieve efficient hybridization. The method is straightforward to operate and can detect milk content as low as 1%, making it suitable for authenticating the purity of specialty dairy products such as yak milk and camel milk.

**Explanation:**
- **Non-nucleic acid amplification:** A method that detects DNA without the need for complex amplification steps.
- **Molecular hybridization:** A technique that uses the complementarity of DNA or RNA fragments to bind together.
- **Mitochondrial DNA:** DNA found within the mitochondria of cells, which is species-specific.
