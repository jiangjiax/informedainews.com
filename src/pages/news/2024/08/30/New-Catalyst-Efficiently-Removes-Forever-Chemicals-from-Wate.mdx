PFAS, or "forever chemicals," are difficult to break down and pose a risk to both human health and the environment. Traditional methods for removing them from water either trap them or break them down, but not both.

Engineers at UBC have developed a new solution. They utilize a combination of iron oxide and graphite as a catalyst. This material captures PFAS and converts them into harmless components. The process is fast, cost-effective, and functions in low light conditions, not just under strong UV.

This catalyst is versatile and can also address other persistent pollutants. The team believes it could revolutionize water purification. They are evaluating its market potential through their company, ReAct Materials.

The catalyst is both simple and sustainable, made from waste materials such as wood or agricultural byproducts. It effectively removes PFAS from water within just three hours, significantly faster than current methods. This innovation could be a major advancement in maintaining clean water supplies.
