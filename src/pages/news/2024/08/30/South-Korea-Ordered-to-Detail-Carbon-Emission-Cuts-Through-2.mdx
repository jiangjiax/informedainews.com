South Korea's Constitutional Court has ordered the government to outline carbon emission reductions through 2049. This decision backs climate activists who claim that inadequate emission cuts infringe on their rights.

The court required revising the climate law, with a focus on strategies from 2031 to 2049. It dismissed demands for a more aggressive 2030 goal, noting that the plaintiffs did not demonstrate the policy as unconstitutional.

Justice Lee Eun-ae pointed out the absence of plans beyond 2031 as unconstitutional, placing a burden on future generations. The Ministry of Environment has committed to adhering to the court's ruling.

Activists anticipate that this verdict will encourage comparable measures worldwide. They call for more robust 2030 targets and comprehensive plans for the following years.

South Korea's government, led by President Yoon Suk Yeol, has prioritized nuclear energy. Critics advocate for less dependence on coal and greater use of renewable energy. Currently, just 9% of South Korea's electricity is derived from renewables, significantly below the OECD average of 34%.

Environmental groups have criticized the court for not advocating for a more ambitious climate goal. Nonetheless, some view the ruling as a pivotal move in Asia, potentially impacting other nations such as Japan.
