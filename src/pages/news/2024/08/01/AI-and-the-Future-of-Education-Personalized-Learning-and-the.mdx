The application of artificial intelligence in education is triggering profound transformations. Traditional educational models, primarily based on Prussian-style large-class instruction, are gradually being replaced by personalized and highly interactive learning methods. AI technologies, such as GPT and Khanmigo, can provide customized learning plans and intelligent tutoring, making learning more efficient and engaging.

The core of education is shifting from knowledge transmission to competency development, such as aesthetics, empathy, and innovative thinking. Although AI can process vast amounts of knowledge, the role of teachers remains indispensable; they are responsible for reviewing, guiding, and establishing relationships with students.

In the future, education will place greater emphasis on students' individual needs and emotional development, with the collaboration of AI and teachers becoming the norm. Education is not just about the transmission of knowledge but also about the accumulation of life and social experiences, a dual emergence of intelligence and emotion.
