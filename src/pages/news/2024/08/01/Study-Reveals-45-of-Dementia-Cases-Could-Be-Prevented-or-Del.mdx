Almost half of dementia cases worldwide could be prevented or delayed. A study identified 14 risk factors.

By addressing these factors from childhood through old age, 45% of dementia cases could be avoided. This includes high "bad" cholesterol from age 40 and untreated vision loss later in life.

The 14 factors: lower education, hearing impairment, high blood pressure, smoking, obesity, depression, physical inactivity, diabetes, excessive alcohol, brain injury, air pollution, social isolation.

Healthy lifestyles—exercise, no smoking, cognitive activity, moderate alcohol—can delay dementia onset.

Recommendations include hearing aids for hearing loss, cholesterol checks from 40, and good-quality education.

Public health interventions could save billions by reducing dementia rates and improving health.

Age and genetics are still top risk factors, but lifestyle and health factors offer a chance for prevention.
