The Paris Olympics sparked excitement with LVMH's substantial 1.5 billion euro sponsorship. Chinese brands such as Alibaba and Mengniu also joined as top sponsors. Local advertisements, including Yili's featuring Chinese athletes, emerged, overcoming language barriers.

Brands utilized the Olympics to enhance visibility, with some like Nike and Adidas sponsoring teams and athletes. Others, such as Yili and Mengniu, experienced short-term sales boosts and long-term brand elevation.

Experts recommend that effective marketing necessitates precision, offline events, and sustained engagement. Despite the high costs, the return on investment from increased brand recognition can be significant.

In essence, the Olympics continue to be a premier platform for brand exposure and engagement, extending beyond the event itself.
