Tai Tzu-ying, a badminton legend, may not have won an Olympic gold medal, but her achievements are undeniable. Since 2016, she has dominated the women's badminton world, accumulating 214 weeks as the world's number one, a record unmatched in history. Tai Tzu-ying won her first international title at the age of 15 and became the world's top player at 22, reigning for 72 consecutive weeks, second only to the longest streak in history.

She has won over 500 matches in her career, claiming 32 titles, the only woman to surpass 30 singles titles. Tai Tzu-ying has never won a World Championship or Olympic gold medal; she has participated in the World Championships nine times, earning only one silver and one bronze. She reached the gold medal match at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics but lost to Chen Yufei. At this year's Paris Olympics, hampered by knee injuries, she was eliminated in the group stage.

Tai Tzu-ying is immensely popular, with fans worldwide cheering her on as if it were her home court. At the French Paris Olympics, spectators chanted "Xiao Dai, go for it!" making it feel like a Taiwanese home game. Commentator Gill Clark praised her playing style and personality as full of talent. Tai Tzu-ying may retire due to injuries, and although she hasn't won an Olympic gold, she has already secured a remarkable career.
