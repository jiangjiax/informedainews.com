The U.S. Copyright Office warns of AI-powered impersonation. They call for a new law to protect against unauthorized digital replicas. These replicas, made easily and cheaply from public data, threaten reputations and livelihoods.

The Office recommends liability for distributing these replicas, not just creating them. Protection should last a lifetime, with options for postmortem extension if needed. They suggest a safe harbor for online platforms to remove unauthorized replicas upon notice.

This law should mirror existing copyright protections but allow states to add extra measures. The Office's focus is on intellectual property, but the issue also touches on privacy and ethics.

In crafting this law, basing it on effective existing legislation might be wiser than starting from scratch.
