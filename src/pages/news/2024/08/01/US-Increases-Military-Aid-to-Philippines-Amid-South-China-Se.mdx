The U.S. pledges $500 million in new military aid to the Philippines. This move deepens the defense alliance as China asserts claims in the South China Sea. Biden and Marcos strengthen ties, unlike Marcos' predecessor who leaned towards China.

The U.S. and Philippines held their first 2+2 session in Manila. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III attended. The meeting focused on countering aggressive Chinese actions in the South China Sea.

The $500 million aid will modernize the Philippine military and coast guard. This funding is unprecedented, signaling strong U.S. support. The U.S. also gained access to four additional Philippine military bases earlier this year.

Tensions peak in the South China Sea. Chinese coast guard vessels have harassed Philippine ships. In one incident, a Philippine sailor lost a thumb. The U.S.-Philippine treaty's mutual defense clause applies to these actions.

China recently allowed a Philippine resupply mission to the Sierra Madre ship without interference. Blinken urged China to refrain from further hostilities against the Philippines in the South China Sea.

The U.S., along with Japan, India, and Australia, denounced military aggression in the South and East China Seas. This joint stance aims to deter China's assertive territorial moves.
