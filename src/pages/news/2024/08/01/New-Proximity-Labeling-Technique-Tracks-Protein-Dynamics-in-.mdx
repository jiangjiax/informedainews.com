Wei Qin, an assistant professor at the School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tsinghua University, has developed a novel proximity labeling technology called TransitID. This technology can track the migration paths of thousands of proteins within living cells, revealing the dynamic transport of proteins both inside and outside the cell. Wei Qin's research findings were published in the journal _Cell_, earning him the honor of being selected as one of the "Innovators Under 35" in China by the _MIT Technology Review_.

The TransitID technology utilizes proximity labeling enzymes to mark target proteins in their vicinity, thereby capturing their dynamic changes. Wei Qin's research extends beyond intracellular processes to include intercellular protein transport, identifying proteins that transfer from cancer cells to macrophages.

Wei Qin's research goal is to drive innovation in proteomics technology, evolving from one-dimensional to four-dimensional representations, to depict the life trajectories of proteins across time, space, function, and interactions. He plans to apply the technology in the field of tumor immunology, exploring the communication mechanisms between tumor cells and immune cells, and providing new insights for novel tumor immunotherapies.

Proximity Labeling (PL): This technique uses specific enzymes to mark target proteins in their vicinity, identifying and capturing molecules that interact with them.

Wei Qin's research not only deepens the understanding of dynamic protein regulation but also provides new avenues for the discovery of disease biomarkers and drug targets. His work demonstrates the powerful potential of chemical biology in the life sciences.
