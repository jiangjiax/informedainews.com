Telegram's latest update is packed with features:

- **In-app Browser**: This browser supports tabs and Web3, and is accessible to nearly a billion users. Pages collapse, allowing you to switch between messages and websites without losing your place.
- **Mini App Store**: Over 500 million users engage with mini apps monthly. A new 'Apps' tab in Search helps you find and access these apps quickly. Developers can showcase their apps with video demos and screenshots.
- **Gifting Stars**: Stars are digital goods in mini apps or paid content in channels. Now, you can gift them to friends. Access via Settings > My Stars.
- **Video Messages**: Use the front flash to brighten your screen in the dark.
- **Weather Widget**: Add animated weather to your stories, automatically switching between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- **Story Covers**: Choose which frame of your video story will be the cover photo.
- **MacOS Tabs**: The new browser on Telegram for macOS supports games, mini apps, and Web3 sites.

This update enhances user experience and opens new opportunities for both developers and users.
