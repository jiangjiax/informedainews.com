The team led by Dr. David Liu has recently upgraded their gene editing system, named eePASSIGE. This technology can precisely insert large gene fragments into designated positions of the DNA in mammalian cells, significantly improving both efficiency and accuracy.

Traditional gene editing requires modifying each mutation individually, whereas eePASSIGE does not. It achieves a leap in gene insertion efficiency by improving the DNA serine recombinase Bxb1. This means that in the future, a single gene editing therapy might be able to treat diseases caused by multiple gene mutations.

This technology is not only expected to enhance ex vivo therapies such as CAR-T immune cell therapy but can also be applied to synthetic biology, optimizing the production of medicinal proteins, and even improving crop traits and yield.

Dr. Xin Gao is one of the main contributors to this research. He used AI technology to predict the structure of Bxb1, optimized experimental conditions, and improved editing efficiency. His next goal is to develop new delivery methods to address the challenges of delivering large molecular editors.

The research by Dr. David Liu's team not only breaks through technical barriers but also brings new hope for the treatment of genetic diseases.
