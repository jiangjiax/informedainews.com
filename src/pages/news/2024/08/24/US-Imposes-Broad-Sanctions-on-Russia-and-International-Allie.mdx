The US Treasury has imposed severe sanctions on Russia, targeting 400 names, individuals, and companies from Russia and beyond. The objective is to eliminate tools that support Russia's military and evade sanctions.

Among the sanctioned entities:
- 46 Chinese firms and one individual.
- 34 Russians, including a son of Russia's Defense Minister.
- International figures from Belarus, Italy, Turkey, and more.

Key Russian entities affected:
- Space firms such as Roscosmos and its affiliates.
- Cargo airlines like Volga-Dnepr and subsidiaries.
- Cybersecurity divisions of MTS and related groups.
- Drone manufacturers Vostok and Stratim.
- Defense research institutes and design bureaus.
- Heavy industries such as Evraz and coal companies.
- Norilsk's mining and metallurgical plants.
- Energy giants YATEK and its affiliates.
- Moscow Jewelry Factory.

Tankers for liquefied natural gas (LNG) transportation, flagged in Palau and Panama, and associated companies, are also subject to sanctions.

This action is significant, targeting sectors crucial to Russia's economy and military. It sends a clear message: supporting Russia's military efforts comes with a high cost.
