This year's midsummer heat broke records, with average temperatures reaching 23.24℃ across China, the highest ever recorded. Southern regions endured prolonged heatwaves, and even after midsummer, the south continues to experience scorching temperatures. The next four days will bring relentless heat to the Sichuan Basin, Jianghan, western Yangtze River Delta, and central-western south China, with local peaks expected to reach up to 42℃ in Sichuan and Chongqing.

July marked a new high for average temperatures, and August is expected to bring even more intense heat to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai. The Climate Change Bluebook 2024 warns of increasing extreme weather events. National forecasts suggest a warmer-than-usual summer, with persistent northern heat and frequent afternoon storms in North and Northeast China.

In June, over 20 weather stations surpassed historical temperature records, and October's national average was the warmest since 1961.
