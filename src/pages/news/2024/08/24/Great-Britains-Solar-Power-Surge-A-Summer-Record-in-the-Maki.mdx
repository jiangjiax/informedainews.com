Great Britain's solar power sector is experiencing significant growth. This summer, solar output is expected to increase by nearly 25% compared to last year. Experts forecast a 16% increase from the 2022 record, with solar generation potentially reaching 5.86 terawatt hours by August.

Solar panels function even on cloudy days, although their efficiency decreases when temperatures are too high. The government aims to triple solar capacity by 2030, while doubling onshore wind capacity and quadrupling offshore wind capacity.

Three new solar farms, approved by the Labour government, will significantly boost capacity. Another potential large-scale farm at Cottam could become the UK's largest.

The "rooftop revolution" initiative aims to install solar panels on millions of homes, thereby reducing energy bills and emissions. The CEO of Solar Energy UK highlights the rapid expansion of solar capacity.

The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero emphasizes the role of solar energy in transforming Britain into a clean energy superpower and reducing energy dependency.

**Explanation of Terms:**
- **Terawatt hours (TWh):** A unit of energy equivalent to one trillion watt hours, used to measure large quantities of electrical energy.
- **Photovoltaic cells:** Devices that directly convert sunlight into electricity.
