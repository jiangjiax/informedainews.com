Led by "Hearthstone's Father" Ben Brode and crafted by the former Blizzard team behind "Hearthstone," "Marvel Snap" is a competitive strategy card game (CCG) set to begin its public beta on August 29th. Developed by Second Dinner Studio, the team includes veterans such as former Hearthstone executive producer Hamilton Chu.

The game is known for its fast-paced battles, with each match lasting only three minutes, where players engage in six rounds using 12 cards. It combines a "shared turn system" with a "super boost" mechanism, offering strong strategic elements that are easy to learn but deeply engaging.

"Marvel Snap" features over 300 Marvel hero cards, each with multiple variant designs created through collaborations with global artists. The game quickly earned the "TGA Game of the Year for Mobile" award after its release, surpassing strong contenders like "Genshin Impact" and "Diablo Immortal."

In summary, "Marvel Snap" is a game that merges the allure of Marvel heroes with the fun of strategy card games, attracting widespread attention with its unique mechanics and fast-paced gameplay.
