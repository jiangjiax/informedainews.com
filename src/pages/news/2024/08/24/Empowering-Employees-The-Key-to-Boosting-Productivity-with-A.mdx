Lifting productivity in Asia requires more than AI; it needs engaged employees. The World Bank notes lagging productivity, partly due to uneven skills and weak management. AI can boost output, but only if workers are empowered to use it.

Employee experience directly impacts the bottom line. Qualtrics research shows firms that excel in understanding and responding to employee feedback see triple revenue growth and double profitability. Yet, employee engagement indicators have stagnated or declined in many Asian countries, especially in the service sector.

Improving employee experience involves better listening and timely responses to workforce needs. This goes beyond annual surveys; frequent, specific insights are crucial. Understanding employee support needs during onboarding, high-performing team characteristics, and software usage can enhance productivity.

During the COVID pandemic, frequent listening programs correlated with higher employee satisfaction and productivity. Companies must adapt engagement strategies as work evolves. Investing in adaptive employee experiences can yield significant organizational benefits.

For example, a leading sports brand doubled sales and boosted customer advocacy by 20 points through employee feedback-driven improvements. Regular training and manager feedback were key.

In short, AI alone won't solve productivity issues. Empowered, engaged employees are the real key.
