Helen Fisher, a biological anthropologist, lived as an Explorerâ€”novelty-seeking, creative, independent. She crafted a personality test categorizing people into four types, each linked to specific neurochemicals. Fisher, high in dopamine, matched with John Tierney, her husband, also an Explorer.

Fisher's research delved into the biological roots of love, identifying three brain systems: sex drive, romantic love, and long-term attachment. Her studies using fMRI scans revealed that love activates brain regions similar to those in addiction.

Her work culminated in the Fisher Temperament Inventory, a test taken by over 40 million people, aiding in matchmaking. Fisher's life, full of romantic entanglements, finally settled with Tierney, whom she married at 75, maintaining separate homes.

Fisher's legacy is her scientific exploration of love, blending hard data with poetic insight, proving that understanding love's biology can enhance relationships. Her life and work underscore the complexity of human emotions and the value of scientific inquiry in unraveling them.
