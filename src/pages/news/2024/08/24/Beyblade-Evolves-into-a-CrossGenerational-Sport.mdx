Beyblade, the spinning tops game, has evolved into a sport. Tomy, the Japanese toy manufacturer, marks its 25th anniversary with the launch of Beyblade X, which sold 5 million units within a year. The game now grants points for gameplay, fostering greater engagement and offering exclusive blades via a mobile app.

In July, 500 players ranging from 6 to 62 years old competed in Osaka. A newcomer, a young boy, triumphed over more experienced opponents. Sales of Beyblade X have outpaced previous versions, exceeding 5 million in Japan.

The Beypoint System rewards players for their involvement and victories, converting gameplay into points that can be redeemed in a lottery for rare blades. The mobile app, utilized by 200,000 players, streamlines point management and enriches the gaming experience.

Tomy has broadened Beyblade's appeal beyond traditional boy's toys, positioning it as a sport that transcends generations. Female participation has risen to nearly 10%, up from 1-3% in earlier tournaments. The company is focused on attracting a more diverse player base and expanding globally.

Venues that host Beyblade events experience higher visitor traffic and sales. Tomy remains committed to enhancing the game to attract a wider audience and maintain its popularity.
