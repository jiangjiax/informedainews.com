Chinese food and beverage companies are making waves globally, especially in Southeast Asia. Haidilao, a Sichuan hotpot chain, led the charge, starting in Singapore twelve years ago. Now, it operates 119 stores worldwide, with most in Southeast Asia.

Other brands like Tai Er, Zhangliang Malatang, and Yangâ€™s Braised Chicken Rice have followed, expanding across multiple countries. Mixue, a bubble tea giant, boasts over 4,000 stores in 11 countries. Even Luckin Coffee, once in trouble, has rebounded with 37 stores in Singapore.

These companies use franchising and direct operations to expand. Franchising is popular, especially in Southeast Asia due to lower costs and easier management. Brands often rely on overseas Chinese entrepreneurs for local expertise.

Despite growth, challenges persist. Supply chain issues and localization are hurdles. Competition is fierce, demanding high operational efficiency, cost control, and innovation.

The expansion reflects China's saturated domestic market and the global appeal of its diverse cuisines.
