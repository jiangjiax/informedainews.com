India's ongoing struggle with women's safety was starkly highlighted by the recent rape and murder of a 31-year-old doctor in Kolkata. This incident, reminiscent of the 2012 Delhi gang-rape, has sparked widespread protests and demands for systemic change.

Despite India's aspirations to global leadership, its record on gender-based violence remains grim. Rape and domestic violence are prevalent, with low conviction rates. The Supreme Court has intervened, questioning the handling of the Kolkata case and advocating for immediate protective measures.

Gender-related violence is not unique to India, but the rapid urbanization and economic growth have not translated into safer public spaces for women. Traditional customs continue to restrict women, making their safety a secondary concern.

The 1997 Supreme Court guidelines to prevent workplace harassment have been ineffectively implemented. Vrinda Grover, a lawyer and women's rights activist, criticizes the unprofessional and prejudiced approach of state authorities in handling sexual assault cases.

The ongoing protests, supported by public figures, underscore broader concerns about workplace safety for women. Gita Gopinath of the IMF emphasizes the necessity of safety for women to fully participate in the labor force.

India ranks 128th out of 177 countries in the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security's annual index, underscoring the urgent need for reform.
