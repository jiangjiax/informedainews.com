Researchers using ESA's Venus Express discovered unexpected increases in H2O and HDO, water molecules with different isotopes, in Venus's middle atmosphere. The ratio of HDO to H2O surged significantly, suggesting a history of water loss and potential past habitability.

Venus, now harsh and dry, might once have had abundant water like Earth. The high HDO/H2O ratio, 120 times what's seen on Earth, indicates heavy water loss due to hydrogen's light weight, allowing it to escape into space.

A proposed mechanism for this involves sulfuric acid aerosols forming above the clouds, which then rise, heat up, and release more HDO than H2O, starting a cycle that enriches the atmosphere in deuterium.

These findings, crucial for understanding planetary habitability, were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
