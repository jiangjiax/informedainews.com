The Justice Department sued RealPage, a property management software provider, for allegedly enabling landlords to fix rents. RealPage's software shared nonpublic information, suggesting rent hikes. This scheme, violating the Sherman Act, hurt millions of renters.

Antitrust laws prevent businesses from unfairly controlling prices. The Sherman Act, a key law, bans monopolies and collusion. RealPage's actions, using software to coordinate rents, skirted these laws, leading to higher rents for tenants.
