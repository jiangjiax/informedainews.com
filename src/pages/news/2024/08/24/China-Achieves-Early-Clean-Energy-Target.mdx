China achieved President Xi's 1,200 gigawatt clean energy goal six years ahead of schedule. In July, an additional 25 gigawatts of wind and solar capacity was added, bringing the total to 1,206 gigawatts. China is the global leader in clean energy investment, setting new records for installations. This rapid expansion has reduced coal-fired power and may have already peaked emissions before 2030.
