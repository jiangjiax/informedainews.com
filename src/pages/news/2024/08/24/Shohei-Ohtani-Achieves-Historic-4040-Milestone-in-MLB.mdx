Shohei Ohtani, Los Angeles Dodgers, made MLB history. He hit his 40th home run and stole his 40th base in 126 games, faster than anyone before. His grand slam won the game against the Tampa Bay Rays, 7-3.

Ohtani's achievement, known as the 40-40 club, puts him among elite players like Alex Rodriguez and Barry Bonds. He's the first Dodger to reach this milestone.

Manager Dave Roberts called it "storybook." Ohtani, humble, focused on team wins, not personal records.

This season, Ohtani's base stealing improved significantly. His 12 steals in August without being caught set a Dodger record.

Ohtani's goal: lead the Dodgers to the World Series. His performance this season makes him a strong contender for National League MVP.
