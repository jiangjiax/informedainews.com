Amazon and Walmart's drone delivery plans face challenges. Amazon's Prime Air project in a Texas college town has been protested by residents over noise issues. The drone noise ranges from 47 to 61 decibels, which residents describe as sounding like a swarm of bees. The mayor has written to the Federal Aviation Administration to express residents' dissatisfaction. Amazon plans to introduce smaller and quieter MK30 drones and expand to Phoenix.

Walmart has partnered with DroneUp, but has ended drone delivery services in some areas due to cost issues. DroneUp plans to lay off 17% of its staff and close 18 distribution centers, aiming to reduce delivery costs from $30 to under $7.

China is actively developing in the drone delivery sector, with drone delivery and takeout services already launched in multiple cities. Beijing has established drone logistics delivery routes, allowing tourists to quickly receive supplies delivered by drones.

Drone delivery faces challenges such as noise, cost, regulation, and technology. Amazon and Walmart need to find a balance between innovation and community harmony. Although drone delivery technology represents the future of logistics, its commercialization still requires time and effort.
