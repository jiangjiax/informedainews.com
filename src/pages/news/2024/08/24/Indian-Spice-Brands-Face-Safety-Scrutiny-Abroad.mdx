Indian spice brands MDH and Everest have faced safety issues abroad. Hong Kong halted sales in April due to high pesticide levels. Britain, New Zealand, the U.S., and Australia have scrutinized imports.

India's Food Safety and Standards Authority tested 4,054 samples. 474 failed, about 12%. No brand-specific data was provided. Penalties were imposed, but details were sparse.

Canada's CFIA monitors the situation, with no current issues reported.

India's spice market is massive, worth $10.44 billion domestically and $4.46 billion in exports.

The incident underscores the global reach and scrutiny of food safety. Even minor lapses can have wide repercussions.
