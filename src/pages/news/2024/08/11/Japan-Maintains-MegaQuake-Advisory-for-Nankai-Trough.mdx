Japan Meteorological Agency warns of a possible mega-quake in the Nankai Trough. The advisory continues following a 7.1 magnitude earthquake near Miyazaki, with no unusual crustal strain detected. A tsunami affected Kyushu and Shikoku, and the earthquake intensity reached lower 6 on a scale of 0 to 7. The agency anticipates more earthquakes, possibly up to lower 6 intensity, within the next week. A special advisory has been issued under the Nankai Trough Earthquake Extra Information protocol. While there is no specific timeframe for an earthquake, disaster preparedness checks are urged in 29 prefectures. The government advises securing furniture and reviewing evacuation plans, with vulnerable households encouraged to consider voluntary evacuation.
