Russia's Kursk region experiences rapid civilian evacuations as Ukraine advances into Russian territory. Over 76,000 people have been relocated. Ukraine's President Zelenskiy confirms military operations in Kursk, with the goal of restoring justice following the 2022 Russian invasion.

Intense fighting continues near the border in three villages. Russia's FSB has activated a counter-terrorism regime in Kursk, Bryansk, and Belgorod, granting extensive security powers.

Rosatom warns of a direct threat to the Kursk nuclear power station due to ongoing hostilities, although there is no direct evidence of Ukrainian forces targeting the plant. Power outages have been reported in Kursk after a substation was hit by a drone.

Belarus has reinforced its border troops in response to alleged Ukrainian drone incursions, which could lead to diplomatic repercussions.

Ukraine's navy claims to have damaged a Russian-used Black Sea gas platform. Casualties have been reported in Russian attacks on Donetsk and Kharkiv, and a Ukrainian drone attack in Lipetsk.

Ukraine has seen a decrease in combat engagements, possibly due to its incursion into Kursk. Russia has launched an air attack on Kyiv, which was repelled by air defenses.

Zelenskiy hints at banning the Moscow-linked Orthodox church, citing its alleged support for the Russian invasion.
