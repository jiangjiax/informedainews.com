Disney's D23 Expo unveiled ambitious plans for its theme parks. A new villains-themed land is set to debut at Magic Kingdom in Orlando, following two years of speculation since the 2022 Expo.

The expansion also includes a "Cars"-themed area in Frontier Land, featuring an off-road rally race and a family-friendly ride. Hollywood Studios will introduce a "Monsters, Inc." land with a suspended coaster tour of the Laugh Factory.

Animal Kingdom's Tropical America's land, slated to open in 2027, will include an Indiana Jones attraction within a Mayan Temple. Additionally, a "Coco" attraction is coming to California Adventure, combining modern audio animatronics with classic ride elements.

Disney plans to invest $60 billion in experiences over the next decade, focusing on new attractions and technology. This strategy aims to maintain the parks' competitiveness and appeal in the post-pandemic era with evolving consumer habits.
