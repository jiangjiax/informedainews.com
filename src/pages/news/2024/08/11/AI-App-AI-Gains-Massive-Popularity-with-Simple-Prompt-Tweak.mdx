"毒舌AI" Twitter Personality, an AI app that critiques Twitter users based on their past tweets, has gone viral. It earns $4,000 per hour by analyzing public accounts without needing permissions. The app hit 5 million users and made $22,000 in 8 hours.

Developer Kyzo made the code open-source on GitHub, encouraging others to build on it. The app runs on Wordware, a low-code platform allowing anyone to create AI apps. Wordware, valued at $180 million, recently faced financial strain due to high traffic and model costs. They resorted to a dynamic pricing model, charging $6.99 in developed regions and $1 to $7.17 elsewhere.

The app's global success stemmed from a simple tweak in the prompt, using the user's language for replies. Wordware, backed by Y Combinator, emphasizes modular, text-based app creation. Its founders believe in the importance of domain experts in AI development, advocating for AI to enhance, not replace, human decision-making.

This approach aligns with industry trends, viewing human language as the latest programming language. The app's simplicity and accessibility highlight a broader shift towards democratizing AI development.
