NH Foods, a Japanese meat processor, is set to introduce a foie gras substitute made from chicken liver to European markets. The product, dubbed "Gras Foie," aims to offer an ethical alternative to traditional foie gras, which is produced by force-feeding ducks and geese.

The company plans to start selling Gras Foie in Europe this year on a trial basis, with full-scale production slated for 2027. Initial markets include France and Spain, known for high foie gras consumption.

Gras Foie combines chicken liver with pork fat and plant-based oil to replicate the taste of foie gras. It was first launched in Japan in 2023 through crowdfunding, achieving five times the sales target.

The product is currently available in Japan via NH Foods' online store and is gaining traction among commercial clients like restaurants and hotels. A four-pack with a special sauce sells for 3,218 yen, significantly cheaper than real foie gras.

NH Foods aims to reduce food waste by utilizing chicken liver, which is often used as animal feed. The company has secured a patent for Gras Foie in Japan and seeks international patents as it expands globally.

The convenience of preparation is a key selling point. Unlike traditional foie gras, which requires careful cooking to avoid melting the fat, Gras Foie is designed to be easier to prepare.

NH Foods envisions replacing all foie gras with Gras Foie worldwide.
