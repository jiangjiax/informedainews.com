Tokyo's Shogakukan is planning an app called Novelous for North American fans of light novels. Set to launch this year, it will utilize AI translation technology from Tokyo startup Mantra, with the goal of offering 400 titles within two years.

Light novels, which are popular in Japan, combine anime-style illustrations with adolescent or fantasy storylines. Shogakukan aims to attract a million users by 2028, targeting revenues in the billions of yen. The app will include features such as vertical scrolling text and speech bubbles for enhanced readability.

Currently, only about 10 titles are available in English due to the high costs of translation. The app intends to increase both digital and print sales, including works from other publishers.

Competitor Kadokawa is a leader in overseas expansion, having acquired U.S. licensor J-Novel Club in 2021. Their light novel sales in North America are about a fifth of their manga sales.

The popularity of anime is driving demand for light novels. "The Apothecary Diaries" became a bestseller at Kinokuniya's U.S. stores following its anime adaptation. Kinokuniya's vice president views light novels as the next major trend after manga and anime.

Japan aims to quadruple its content exports to 20 trillion yen by 2033.
