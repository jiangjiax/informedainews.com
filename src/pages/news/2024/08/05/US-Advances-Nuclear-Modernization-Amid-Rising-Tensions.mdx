The US is upgrading its nuclear arsenal. Vipin Narang, acting US Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy, cites Russia's nuclear stance as the reason. Jill Hruby, US Under Secretary for Nuclear Security, detailed the modernization plans at the National Institute for Deterrence Studies.

The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) seeks a $25 billion budget for 2025. This includes:
- $21 billion for nuclear weapon stockpile maintenance.
- $2 billion for nuclear non-proliferation efforts.
- $2 billion for Navy nuclear propulsion systems.

The NNSA aims to replace all nuclear components and designs. Over 200 modernized weapons were delivered to the Department of Defense in 2023. The modernization spans the nuclear triadâ€”land, air, and sea-based systems.

Key programs include:
- W88 Alteration 370 for Navy's Trident II D5 SLBM.
- B61-12 and B61-13 for newer aircraft compatibility.
- W80-4 for Air Force's Long Range Standoff Cruise Missile.
- W87-1 for land-based Minuteman III ICBM.
- W93 for ballistic missile submarines.
- Sea-Launched Cruise Missile-Nuclear (SLCM-N) for low-yield, non-ballistic capability.

Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister, Sergei Ryabkov, warns that US escalation could prompt Moscow to strengthen its nuclear deterrence. President Vladimir Putin considers adjusting Russia's nuclear doctrine due to the West's lowered nuclear use threshold. He denies Russia brandishes the "nuclear stick" and emphasizes the clear conditions for nuclear use in Russia's doctrine.
