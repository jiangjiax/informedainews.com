Ukrainian pilots now fly F-16s, announced Zelenskiy. These jets, long sought, arrived 29 months post-Russian invasion. At an undisclosed airbase, Zelenskiy addressed pilots, with two F-16s overhead.

"F-16s are in Ukraine. We did it. Proud of our guys mastering these jets," he said. The jets' impact on air defenses and the battlefield remains unclear. Russia targets potential F-16 bases, vowing to shoot them down.

Ukraine lacked enough trained pilots and jets. "Positive thing is we expect more F-16s... many guys training," Zelenskiy noted. Ukraine's Soviet-era planes were outmatched by Russia's advanced fleet.

Zelenskiy sees this as a new stage for Ukraine's air force. "We did a lot for Ukrainian forces to transition to western combat aviation," he said, highlighting relentless diplomacy.

The jets' missile range is unclear. Longer range could enhance battlefield impact. Zelenskiy hopes NATO countries might help intercept Russian missiles. "Another tool... I want to try it," he said, aiming to avoid excessive escalation fears.
