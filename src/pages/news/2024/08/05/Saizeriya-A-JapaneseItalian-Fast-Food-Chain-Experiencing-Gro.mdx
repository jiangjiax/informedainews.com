In terms of operations, Saizeriya employs a central kitchen model, constructing its own farms and processing plants to control costs and quality from the source. It also effectively reduces labor costs through flexible employment and increased hourly productivity. This meticulous management allows Saizeriya to remain profitable even during economic downturns.

Saizeriya's success is not solely attributed to its low-price strategy but also to its rigorous control over costs and efficiency. In the context of escalating global economic uncertainty, Saizeriya's experience is worth emulating for other food and beverage enterprises.
