New antibiotic, macrolones, strikes bacteria twice. It inhibits protein production and disrupts DNA, leaving bacteria unable to defend against both attacks simultaneously. This makes it more difficult for them to develop resistance. Macrolones are synthetic compounds that combine elements of erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. Erythromycin halts protein synthesis, while ciprofloxacin targets DNA gyrase, an enzyme crucial for bacterial function. Scientists suggest refining macrolones to enhance their effectiveness on both targets.
