Global stock markets have experienced significant declines, with the Japanese stock market plummeting by 6%. Weak U.S. employment data, a surge in the yen, tensions in the Middle East, and damaged investor confidence have all contributed to the downturn. The Nikkei 225 index has fallen by over 12% in just three days, and the Tokyo Stock Exchange has triggered a circuit breaker, entering a technical bear market. Banking stocks led the decline, with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group's share price dropping by 21%. South Korean and Australian stock markets also saw simultaneous declines.

- Technical bear market: A market that has fallen by 20% or more from its recent high.
- Circuit breaker mechanism: A temporary halt in trading when the market drops to a certain level to prevent panic selling.
