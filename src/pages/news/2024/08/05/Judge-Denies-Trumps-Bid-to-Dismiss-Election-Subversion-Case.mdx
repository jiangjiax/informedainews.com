Judge Tanya Chutkan denied Trump's attempt to dismiss his election subversion case. Trump's team alleged he was targeted for political reasons. Chutkan dismissed this claim, concentrating on his alleged false statements and obstruction.

The case, which had been on hold since December, gained new momentum following the Supreme Court's ruling on presidential immunity. The high court's 6-3 decision clarified that while presidents enjoy broad immunity, it is not absolute. Chutkan now must determine which charges are valid.

Trump faces four counts for attempting to overturn his 2020 loss. His lawyers contend he is immune as a former president. The case continues with a status conference scheduled for August 16.
