Earnings season is intensifying. Investors are advised to look beyond quarterly results. Leading Wall Street analysts favor stocks with long-term potential.

ServiceNow is next. Its cloud-based workflow automation has made a strong impression. Goldman Sachs' Kash Rangan raised the price target, attributing it to robust growth and AI contributions.
