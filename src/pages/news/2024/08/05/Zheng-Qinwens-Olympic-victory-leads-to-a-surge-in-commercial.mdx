Zheng Qinwen, a 21-year-old girl from Hubei, has become the champion of the women's singles tennis event at the Paris Olympics. Her victory, which lasted 1 hour and 47 minutes, marks a new chapter in Chinese tennis history. Prior to this, no Chinese athlete had ever reached the final of the tennis singles event at the Olympics.

Zheng Qinwen's path to victory was fraught with challenges. She staged a comeback against American player Navarro in the round of 16, defeated former world number one Kerber in the quarterfinals, and beat the current world number one Swiatek in the semifinals. Her performance has earned her the title of "Queen of Comebacks."

Commercially, Zheng Qinwen has become a darling. In the Forbes 2023 list, she ranks 15th with an income of $7.2 million, including $5.5 million from endorsements. Her endorsement brands include Nike, Ant Group, and Yili.

Zheng Qinwen does not want to be merely seen as "the next Li Na." She has her own path, a more international perspective, and a more professional plan. Her future is filled with possibilities.

Sports agencies believe that Zheng Qinwen's commercial value is in the top tier, with endorsement fees exceeding tens of millions. Experts point out that the commercial value of tennis players mainly depends on their performance in professional tournaments, not Olympic results.

Zheng Qinwen's new endorsements include Lancôme and Tea King. Her Weibo followers have surged, and her influence continues to expand. Her success is not only a victory for sports but also a victory for business.
