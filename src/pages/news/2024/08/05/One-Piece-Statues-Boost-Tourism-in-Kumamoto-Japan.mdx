Kumamoto, Japan, has turned to "One Piece" statues to draw tourists and aid recovery from 2016 earthquakes. The One Piece Kumamoto Revival Project, a partnership with manga creator Eiichiro Oda, features ten bronze statues across nine municipalities.

Statues of Straw Hat Pirates like Luffy, Sanji, and Usopp attract fans from Taiwan, the Philippines, and beyond. A Taiwanese couple and a Filipino duo visited, posing by Luffy's statue at the Kumamoto prefectural office.

The project, completed in 2022, includes a fictional narrative where the crew helps rebuild Kumamoto, known as "Hino Kuni." Social media buzz, especially from the official "One Piece" account, boosts visibility.

This initiative not only revitalizes tourism but also symbolizes community resilience and global fandom's support.
