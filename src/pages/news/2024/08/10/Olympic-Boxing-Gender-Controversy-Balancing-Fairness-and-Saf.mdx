Gender controversy at Paris Olympics sparks debate. Algeria's Imane Khelif and Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting faced disqualification and slander. Misinformation spread, labeling them transgender or claiming disorder of sex development (DSD). DSD refers to variations in chromosomes or reproductive organs.

IBA and IOC conflict complicates matters. IBA's gender tests and public naming raise issues. History shows past gender suspicions and invasive checks. IOC's 1968 chromosomal tests led to mental health crises. Tests abolished in 2000 due to discrimination and scientific doubts.

Science now recognizes gender complexity. XY chromosomes don't always mean masculine bodies. Sports separate men and women by testosterone levels, but this method is flawed. Testosterone's impact on strength varies, and it's not the sole factor for athletic prowess.

The debate continues, highlighting the need for fairer, safer sports policies.
