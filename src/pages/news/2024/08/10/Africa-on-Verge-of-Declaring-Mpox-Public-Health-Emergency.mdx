Africa CDC may declare a public health emergency due to rising mpox cases. Dr. Jean Kaseya, the director, warns of a potential pandemic if borders aren't secured. This week, 887 new cases pushed the year's total to 15,132, a 160% increase from last year. Sixteen countries are affected, with the Democratic Republic of Congo leading in cases and deaths.

Mpox, a viral disease causing rashes and flu-like symptoms, is related to smallpox. It spreads through direct contact. A new, more virulent strain was reported in the DRC. Vaccine shortages in Africa complicate control efforts; only 200,000 doses are available against a demand of 10 million. The AU approved $10.4 million to support the fight against mpox.

Kaseya emphasizes collective action. The WHO may declare a global emergency. The process involves technical consultations and a summit of African Union heads of state.
