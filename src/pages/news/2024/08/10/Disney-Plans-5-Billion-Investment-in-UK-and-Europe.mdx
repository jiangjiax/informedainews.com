Disney plans to invest $5 billion in the UK and Europe over the next five years, primarily for film and television production. Approximately $1 billion per year will be allocated to movie and TV production, including content for Disney+ and National Geographic. Additionally, â‚¬2 billion will be used to expand Disneyland Paris.

This move underscores Disney's commitment to the European market, particularly in its strategic positioning post-Brexit. Investing in Disneyland Paris not only enhances visitor experiences but also strengthens Disney's physical presence in Europe.

Disney has been actively acquiring and investing in recent years, such as its $15 billion investment in Epic Games, showcasing its ambition to expand in the gaming and digital entertainment sectors. These initiatives aim to solidify its leadership position in the global entertainment industry.
