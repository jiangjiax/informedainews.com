Ukrainian forces ambushed a Russian convoy deep in Kursk, triggering a federal emergency in Russia. The Kremlin responded by moving military reserves, including Grad rockets and tanks, to the region.

A video showed the destroyed convoy near Oktyabrskoe, with casualties evident. This attack mirrored earlier strikes near Kyiv, showcasing Ukraine's hit-and-run tactics.

In Kursk, the acting governor urged calm among residents, while 3,000 civilians were evacuated. Meanwhile, a Russian missile hit a supermarket in Kostiantynivka, killing 10 Ukrainians and injuring 35.

Ukraine's incursion into Kursk marked a significant shift, employing fast-moving maneuver warfare, a stark contrast to the trench-dominated battles seen previously.

Russian military bloggers reported Ukraine's capture of parts of Sudzha, with tactics involving armored vehicles and ambushes. Ukraine's leaders have been cautious in their public comments about the operation.

Analysts suggest this attack has psychologically impacted Putin's image and might divert Russian forces from the Donbas, easing pressure on Ukraine's eastern front.

The White House has shown support for Ukraine's actions, despite previous concerns about escalating the conflict. The Pentagon emphasized its policy consistency but reiterated its opposition to long-range attacks into Russia.
