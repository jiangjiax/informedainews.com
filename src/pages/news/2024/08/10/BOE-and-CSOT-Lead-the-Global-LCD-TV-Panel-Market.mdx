BOE leads the global LCD TV panel shipments in the first half of 2024, reaching 28.1 million units. CSOT follows, with a market share of 20.6%. These two Chinese companies are in the lead, showcasing the strength of China's panel manufacturing. Korean LGD and Japanese Sharp have seen growth in shipments, while Taiwanese Innolux and AUO have also performed well.

Demand for OLED is rising, prompting BOE and others to accelerate their OLED deployment. BOE's OLED screens are already supplying Apple's iPhone, with nearly 40 million units shipped in the first three quarters.
