The United States, along with 18 states and 38 additional jurisdictions, has filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google LLC. The suit, initiated under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, targets Google's alleged monopolization of general search services, search advertising, and text advertising markets. The plaintiffs accuse Google of maintaining these monopolies through anticompetitive practices.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the initial 18 states seek to restrain Google's monopolistic activities and remedy their effects. Meanwhile, 38 other states and jurisdictions have filed a separate action, incorporating the DOJ's allegations and adding further claims of Google's unlawful monopoly maintenance.

This legal action marks a significant challenge to Google's dominance in the tech industry, aiming to restore competition and fairness in the markets it allegedly controls.
