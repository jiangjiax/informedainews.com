The U.K. government is considering stricter tech regulation following recent violence fueled by online disinformation. Prime Minister Keir Starmer plans to review the Online Safety Act (OSA), which was enacted in September 2023. The OSA requires platforms to remove illegal content and protect users from harm, such as hate speech, with significant fines for non-compliance.

Starmer emphasizes that online spaces are not lawless, pointing to prosecutions for hate speech linked to the violence. However, he acknowledges the need for broader scrutiny of social media. London Mayor Sadiq Khan criticizes the OSA as inadequate.

The unrest started after a knife attack in Southport, with false claims about the attacker's identity causing widespread chaos. A woman was arrested for allegedly spreading these falsehoods.

The OSA, which is not yet fully operational, faces criticism for its drafting and for omitting provisions against "legal but harmful" speech. Critics argue it fails to address platforms' profit models based on outrage-driven engagement.

Platforms like Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) claim to enforce content standards, but enforcement is often opaque. The EU is already scrutinizing X for its handling of disinformation.

Once the OSA is fully operational, it could pressure platforms to more proactively manage misinformation. The U.K.'s internet regulator warns of the risks posed by social media in inciting violence.
