Sketch2Scene transforms rough sketches into interactive 3D game environments. It employs deep learning and a 2D image model to decipher drawings, subsequently converting them into 3D scenes using game engines such as Unity or Unreal. This process guarantees that the end result matches the creator's original concept, enhancing the intuitiveness and accessibility of game design.
