Grant Smith, a security researcher, tackled a smishing scam aimed at USPS customers. Scammers sent texts, masquerading as USPS, requesting credit card details. Smith's wife was duped, sparking his investigation.

He traced the scammers to a Chinese-language group, infiltrated their systems, and collected evidence. He then collaborated with USPS and a US bank to safeguard over 438,000 credit cards.

The scam encompassed 1,133 domains, capturing over 1.2 million pieces of information. Smith's efforts likely only touched the surface, as similar scams have been identified in other countries.
