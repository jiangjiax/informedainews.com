Major League Baseball plans to hold a game at Bristol Motor Speedway, a NASCAR venue, on August 2, 2025. The game will feature the Atlanta Braves against the Cincinnati Reds, marking the first MLB regular-season game in Tennessee.

Bristol Motor Speedway, which seats nearly 150,000, could potentially break the MLB attendance record. The current record of 115,300 was set in 2008 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred views this event as an opportunity to blend sports, music, and community in Tennessee. The league is looking to expand its reach, having previously played in nontraditional venues such as military bases and iconic movie locations.

Bristol Motor Speedway has previously hosted diverse events, including an NFL game and an NCAA football game that attracted a record-breaking 156,990 spectators.

Atlanta Braves' Austin Riley sees the event as a unique and fun experience, reflecting MLB's broader strategy to engage new audiences.
