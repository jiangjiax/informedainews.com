"Avatar 3: Fire and Ash" is set to release on December 19, 2025, in North America and China simultaneously. The film has completed motion capture and live-action shooting and has entered post-production. Director James Cameron revealed that the film carries high emotional risks, with characters' emotions significantly impacted, and there may be unexpected twists. Cameron is already contemplating "Avatar 4," which might require the efforts of several generations to complete and could potentially be directed by other filmmakers. The release dates for the "Avatar" sequels are scheduled for 2025, 2029, and 2031.
