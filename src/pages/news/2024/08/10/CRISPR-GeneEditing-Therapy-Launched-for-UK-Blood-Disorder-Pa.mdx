Gene-editing therapy, CRISPR, makes its debut on the UK's National Health Service (NHS). It targets beta thalassaemia, a blood disorder. Stem cells are extracted, corrected, and then reinserted. The aim is to eliminate the need for lifelong, frequent blood transfusions. Beta thalassaemia impairs the production of haemoglobin, which is vital for oxygen transport. This genetic condition affects energy levels, breathing, and life span. It marks a significant step forward in medical innovation.
