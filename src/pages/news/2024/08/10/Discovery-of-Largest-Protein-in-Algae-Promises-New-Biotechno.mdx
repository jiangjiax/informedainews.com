Scientists discovered a colossal protein, PKZILLA-1, in algae. It measures 1250 nm in length and weighs 4730 kDa, aiding in the production of a toxin lethal to fish. This protein surpasses titin, the former record holder in size.

PKZILLA-1 and PKZILLA-2, both enzymes, undergo 239 reactions to synthesize prymnesin. This groundbreaking discovery could pave the way for new diagnostic tests for algae and innovative chemical products, potentially including cancer treatments.
