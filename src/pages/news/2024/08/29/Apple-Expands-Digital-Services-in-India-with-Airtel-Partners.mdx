Apple has partnered with India's Bharti Airtel, bundling Apple TV+ and Music with Airtel's premium plans. Airtel, India's second-largest telecom with 281 million subscribers, aims to expand Apple's digital services reach.

Apple TV+, small in India's $28 billion media market, competes with Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+ Hotstar, and JioCinema. Known for originals like Ted Lasso, it stands out with in-house content.

Airtel plans to announce new tariffs including free Apple TV+. Apple TV+ costs $9.99 in the U.S., 99 rupees in India. JioCinema, offering free cricket, starts at 29 rupees. Cricket is a major draw in India.

Apple Music, at 99 rupees, integrates with Airtel's Wynk app, which shuts down. Apple holds 6% of India's smartphone market, dominated by Samsung, Xiaomi, and Google's Android.
