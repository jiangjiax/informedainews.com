New research on the Cascadia Subduction Zone, a 600-mile fault line off the west coast of North America, suggests a major earthquake is imminent. This fault, where the Pacific Plate dives under the continent, periodically locks and then releases massive stress, causing powerful earthquakes and towering tsunamis.

The last big quake hit in 1700. Scientists now map the fault's complex structures, aiming to predict where and how severe the next quake might be. They've discovered the fault isn't a single, continuous break but is segmented, which could affect the quake's intensity.

One segment, stretching from Vancouver Island to Washington, appears particularly dangerous due to its smooth, uninterrupted nature and shallow angle of subduction. This could mean a more severe quake directly affecting land, especially around Seattle and Tacoma.

The research, funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation, uses advanced sonar to image the seafloor. This data helps refine models for earthquake and tsunami risks, potentially guiding future building codes and warning systems.

Scientists continue to analyze these findings, with implications for coastal safety expected soon. The complexity of the fault demands careful study to prepare for the inevitable next seismic event.
