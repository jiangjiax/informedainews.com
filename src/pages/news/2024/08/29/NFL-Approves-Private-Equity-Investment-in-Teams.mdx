NFL owners have approved private equity firms to acquire up to 10% of teams. This decision, backed by 31 out of 32 owners, permits these funds to invest in up to six teams each. Cincinnati Bengals owner Mike Brown was the sole dissenter.

The approved firms include Ares Management, Sixth Street Partners, and Arctos Partners, among others. These firms, managing assets totaling $2 trillion, plan to invest $12 billion. This capital infusion is intended to aid team growth and improve fan experiences.

The minimum investment period is set at six years. This move addresses liquidity concerns within ownership groups and introduces a new capital source without disrupting team operations.

Subject to final approval, Arctos may invest across major North American sports leagues. The NFL, being the last major league to permit private equity, restricts investment to 10%, in contrast to other leagues that allow up to 30%.

This initiative could also finance new stadiums and renovations, benefiting teams such as the Buffalo Bills and Tennessee Titans.

Overall, the NFL's acceptance of private equity signifies a strategic change, aiming to strengthen team finances and infrastructure while preserving operational independence.
