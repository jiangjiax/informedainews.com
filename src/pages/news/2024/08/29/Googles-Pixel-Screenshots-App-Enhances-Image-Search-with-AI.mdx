Google's Pixel Screenshots app simplifies searching through vast collections of saved images. Available on Pixel 9 series devices, it uses AI named "Gemini Nano" to title and summarize each screenshot.

During a demo, the app summarized a hair dye guide article. Users can search by typing or speaking, finding relevant screenshots quickly. For instance, saying "What's the Wi-Fi code at Jared's house?" pulled up the needed info.

The app also suggests actions like "Search in Maps" for screenshots with addresses and allows setting reminders for unread articles.

This tool streamlines the often tedious task of sifting through screenshots, making it a standout AI feature for 2024.
