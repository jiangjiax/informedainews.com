Typhoon Gaemi struck hard in July, causing extensive flooding in the Philippines, Taiwan, and China's Hunan province. Over 100 people were killed, and millions were affected. Winds reached speeds of 145 mph, sinking ships, and floods in Manila rose to building-high levels.

Scientists from the World Weather Attribution (WWA) attribute Gaemi's ferocity to global heating, caused by the burning of fossil fuels. Wind speeds increased by 9 mph, and rainfall was 14% higher. Hot sea temperatures, a key factor in cyclone strength, are linked to the climate crisis.

Dr. Ben Clarke of Imperial College London warns of larger, more deadly typhoons in the future unless we transition to renewable energy. Dr. Friederike Otto adds that reducing inequality and protecting the vulnerable is crucial.

Since 1900, typhoon intensity in the Pacific has increased by 30%. Carbon emissions continue to rise. Researchers used weather data and climate models to study Gaemi's impact, conducting the first comprehensive analysis of its kind.

Maja Vahlberg of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre notes progress in flood protection but emphasizes the need for stronger action, particularly for those living in vulnerable areas. She states that the future depends on our decisions now.
