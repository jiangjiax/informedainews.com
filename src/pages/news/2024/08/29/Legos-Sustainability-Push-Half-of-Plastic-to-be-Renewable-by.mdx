Lego aims to shift half of its plastic to renewable or recycled sources by 2026. Currently, 22% of their bricks use fossil fuels. They plan to go fully green by 2032, testing over 600 materials.

The move costs moreâ€”up to 70% extra for certified renewable resin. Lego absorbs these costs, not passing them to consumers. They've tripled sustainability spending to 3 billion Danish kroner annually by 2025.

Lego's also expanded its brick takeback program, Replay, into the UK. They test similar models in the US and Europe.

Sales rose 13% in the first half of this year, hitting 31 billion kroner. Operating profit surged 26% to 8.1 billion kroner. New sets, including high-end models like the Lamborghini kit and Eiffel Tower, boosted performance.

Lego's CEO, Niels Christiansen, emphasized the relevance of their portfolio across ages and interests, driving demand. They use their financial strength to invest in strategic initiatives for future growth.
