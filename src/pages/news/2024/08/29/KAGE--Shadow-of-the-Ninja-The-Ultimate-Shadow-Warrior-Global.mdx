"KAGE ~ Shadow of the Ninja: The Unbroken Shadow," a beat-'em-up action game developed by Tengo Project under NatsumeAtari, is set to launch globally on August 29. This game is a modern remake of the classic 1990 title, retaining its 16-bit pixel art style while introducing new systems and details.

The game offers both arcade and racing modes, with options for single-player or cooperative play, allowing players to experience redesigned levels. New character movements and a seven-item system enrich the combat options. Levels and enemy designs have been comprehensively upgraded to enhance immersion.

The music is composed by Ikuro Waterzumi and Hiroyuki Iwatsuki, and a digital soundtrack featuring 16 tracks will also be released.

**Explanation:**
