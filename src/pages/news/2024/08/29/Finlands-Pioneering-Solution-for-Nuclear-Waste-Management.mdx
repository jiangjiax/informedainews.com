Finland's Onkalo, the world's first geological nuclear waste repository, is set to begin operations within the next few years. Located deep beneath the forests of southwest Finland, this facility will store spent nuclear fuel in durable copper canisters, encased in bedrock over 400 meters below ground.

The project, managed by Posiva, a Finnish company jointly owned by nuclear power company TVO and utility Fortum, marks a significant milestone in nuclear waste management. Onkalo, named after a Finnish word for a small cave, is designed to isolate nuclear waste from human contact for 100,000 years.

The initiative has sparked global interest, with many viewing it as a model for sustainable nuclear energy. Despite debates over the long-term safety of nuclear waste and the role of nuclear power in combating climate change, Onkalo's approach offers a concrete solution to a pressing environmental and technological challenge.

Gareth Law, a professor of radiochemistry at the University of Helsinki, praised the project as a "big milestone" for Finland and the international nuclear industry. He noted that while many countries are still in the planning stages, Finland is "at least a decade ahead" in implementing a safe and robust method for nuclear waste disposal.

The Onkalo project is based on the KBS-3 method, a multi-barrier principle developed by the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company. This method employs several engineered barriers to ensure the long-term safety of spent nuclear fuel, making it a pioneering approach in the field of nuclear waste management.
