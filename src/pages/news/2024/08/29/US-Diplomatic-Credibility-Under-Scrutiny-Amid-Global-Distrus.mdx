Iran's Supreme Leader Khamenei advises President Pezeshkian to negotiate with the US but warns against trusting them. Iran's distrust of the US stems from Trump's 2018 withdrawal from the JCPOA, the Iranian nuclear deal, and Biden's refusal to return in 2022. Iran's nuclear program has advanced significantly since the JCPOA.

The credibility of the US is globally questioned. NATO expanded eastward despite assurances given to Gorbachev. Glaspie's comments to Saddam Hussein prior to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait were misinterpreted as US neutrality.

Countries are skeptical of US promises. Over 40 nations are seeking BRICS membership to escape Western financial systems. The Iranian nuclear deal is nearly irrelevant given Iran's advanced enrichment capabilities.

US sanctions are losing their effectiveness. Russia's economy grew despite Western sanctions. Countries like Iran and Russia are adapting, becoming more self-sufficient. The rise in BRICS and SCO memberships is leading to de-dollarization, undermining the US's economic power.
