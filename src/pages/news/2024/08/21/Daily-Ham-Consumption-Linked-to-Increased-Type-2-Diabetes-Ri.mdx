Two slices of ham daily may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes by 15%, according to a Cambridge-led study involving 2 million people worldwide. The findings were published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology.

The study found that processed and red meats are associated with a higher risk of diabetes, while the link with poultry is less clear. Consuming 50 grams of processed meat daily increases the risk by 15%, while 100 grams of unprocessed red meat raises the risk by 10%. The risk increase for poultry is 8%, indicating a weaker correlation.

The research supports the idea of limiting intake of processed and red meats. The UK's National Health Service recommends consuming no more than 70 grams of meat daily. The study provides more concrete evidence of the link between meat consumption and diabetes.

It's important to note that the study shows an association, not causation, and aligns with recommendations for healthy eating. Moderate meat intake, along with a focus on vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, beans, peas, and lentils, is advised. Regular physical activity is also key to reducing the risk of diabetes.
