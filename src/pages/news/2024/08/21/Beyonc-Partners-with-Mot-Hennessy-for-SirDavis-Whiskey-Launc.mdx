Beyoncé collaborates with Moët Hennessy to launch SirDavis whiskey, named in honor of her great-grandfather, a moonshine maker, reflecting her heritage. Crafted in Texas, the whiskey combines rye and malted barley, aged in sherry casks. Priced at $89, it will be available in stores starting September.

Moët Hennessy, a division of LVMH, focuses on luxury products. "Moonshine" denotes illegally produced alcohol, historically made during Prohibition.
