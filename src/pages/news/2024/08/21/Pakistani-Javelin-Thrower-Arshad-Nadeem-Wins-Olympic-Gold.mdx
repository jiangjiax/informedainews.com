Arshad Nadeem, a Pakistani javelin thrower, won Olympic gold in Paris, setting a world record with a throw of 92.97 meters. This victory marked Pakistan's first gold in track and field and its first Olympic medal since 1992.

Nadeem's success has transformed his village, where cricket was the dominant sport. Now, children use branches as javelins, inspired by his achievement. Nadeem started with homemade javelins due to a lack of facilities and funding.

His victory has brought national recognition and substantial rewards, including over $1.2 million in prize money, three cars, and an apartment, all tax-free. This could encourage more funding for lesser-known sports in Pakistan, traditionally focused on cricket and hockey.

Nadeem's journey from a mud-brick house in Khanewal to Olympic champion shows the potential for underfunded sports to produce global success. His story might shift the focus in Pakistan from cricket to other athletic pursuits.
