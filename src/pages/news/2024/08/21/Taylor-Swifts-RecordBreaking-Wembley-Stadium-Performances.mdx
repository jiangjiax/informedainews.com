Taylor Swift shattered records at Wembley Stadium, playing to over 1.2 million UK fans this summer. Her Eras Tour finale featured guest appearances by Florence Welch and Jack Antonoff, and premiered a new music video. Swift's eight Wembley shows surpassed Michael Jackson's 1988 Bad Tour record for solo artists.

The tour, spanning 131 dates, boosted the UK economy by an estimated Â£1bn. Geophysicists recorded seismic waves from fan dancing at Murrayfield Stadium, peaking at 23.4 nanometres during "Ready For It?"

Swift's London shows outnumbered any other city on her tour. She expressed gratitude to fans for memorizing her lyrics. The Eras Tour has broken box office records and dominated headlines for over a year.

Despite the tour's success, tragic events marred the summer. A Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport suffered a fatal stabbing, and three Vienna concerts were canceled due to a security threat. Swift reached out to the Southport victims but did not reference these incidents on stage, focusing instead on the tour's sense of community.
