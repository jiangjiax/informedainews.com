The Tesla Cybertruck was spotted on the streets of Tianjin, sporting a new energy vehicle license plate, sparking heated discussions. The vehicle, listed at a staggering 3.5 million yuan on second-hand platforms, highlights its scarcity and appeal. Previously, the Cybertruck faced difficulties in being legally driven on Chinese roads due to design issues, but its successful registration indicates that some owners have modified it to meet Chinese regulatory requirements.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk had stated that it would be challenging for the Cybertruck to be legally driven in China and that a "special edition" compliant with Chinese standards would need to be produced. Despite this, some owners have successfully registered their vehicles by importing them through parallel channels. Tesla China has no current sales plans, but it does not rule out the possibility of consumers purchasing through unofficial channels.

The Cybertruck features a unique design with an ultra-hard stainless steel body, offering excellent durability and ease of maintenance. The high-performance version, the "Cyberbeast," accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in just 2.7 seconds with a range of up to 547 kilometers. In terms of autonomous driving, the Cybertruck supports FSD functionality.

Although the Cybertruck faces challenges in terms of positioning and acceptance in the Chinese market, its successful registration undoubtedly lays a foundation for Tesla's development in China and brings new vitality to the Chinese new energy vehicle market.
