Trump, eyeing a White House return, dangles a cabinet spot for Musk. He's also mulling axing the $7500 electric car tax credit, a move that could jolt Tesla's sales. Trump's mixed signals on EVs—liking them but not the incentives—mirror his past push to scrap these credits, which Biden later expanded.

Their live chat? A mix of mutual praise and divergent views, hinting at a complex alliance. Trump sees a future where fossil fuels still power EVs, and he's intrigued by solar panels on Tesla cars.

On Google, Trump's fiery but vague threats follow a court's monopoly verdict. His stance on the Fed? He claims presidential rights to comment on interest rates, though he downplays any sway over the central bank.

Trump's knack for bold, sometimes contradictory statements keeps the political and economic waters roiled. His potential policies could reshape the auto industry and tech landscape, stirring both anticipation and anxiety.
