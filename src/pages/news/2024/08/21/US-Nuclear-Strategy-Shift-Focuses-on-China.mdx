Biden's new nuclear strategy shifts focus to China. Approved in March, it aims to counter China's expanding nuclear arsenal. The strategy also considers joint threats from China, Russia, and North Korea. A public report is due before Biden's term ends.

The U.S. worries about China's nuclear growth, especially over the next decade. The strategy seeks to deter all three nations simultaneously.

Recently, China tightened export controls on antimony, crucial for U.S. military and nuclear weapons. China, along with Tajikistan and Russia, holds over 90% of global antimony reserves. The U.S. relies heavily on China for this resource.

China claims these measures are for national security and non-proliferation. Last July, U.S.-China nuclear talks stalled due to U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.
