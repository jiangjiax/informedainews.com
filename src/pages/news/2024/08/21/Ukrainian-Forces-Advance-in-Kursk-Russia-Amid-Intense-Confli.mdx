Ukrainian forces pushed deep into Russia's Kursk region, capturing villages and destroying strategic bridges. A pontoon bridge, hastily built by Russian troops, was obliterated by kamikaze drones. Satellite images confirmed its destruction, with plumes of smoke marking the site.

Ukraine's advance, a surprise incursion, trapped around 3,000 Russian conscripts. Civilians fled by boat. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy claimed control over 1,250 sq km of Russian territory, including 92 settlements. He kept the operation secret, fearing international skepticism.

Russia, meanwhile, made gains in eastern Ukraine, capturing Niu-York and advancing near Pokrovsk. Zelenskiy admitted challenges in Donetsk province, with intense fighting reported.

Military experts debate the impact of Ukraine's Kursk operation. Some see it as a morale booster, others worry about potential heavy casualties. Ukraine's decision to exclude key allies from the planning stage reflects past leaks' impact on previous operations.

Domestic and international tensions escalated. Ukraine banned a Russian-linked Orthodox church, citing spiritual independence. Russia condemned the move and protested against American journalists' presence in Kursk, accusing them of propaganda.

The conflict's trajectory remains uncertain, with both sides claiming victories and facing setbacks. The human cost, however, is undeniable, with lives lost and communities shattered on both sides of the border.
