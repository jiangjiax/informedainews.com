Swiss researchers have developed a new blood sampling device inspired by leeches. This gadget employs a suction cup and tiny needles instead of traditional needles, reducing pain and fear.

Leeches have a unique method of sucking blood using a mouthful of sharp teeth and a suction mechanism. This new device mimics that process: a suction cup attaches to the arm, tiny needles pierce the skin, and a vacuum draws blood into a container.

Leeches release a substance called hirudin, which prevents blood clotting, allowing them to feed uninterrupted. This device also uses a similar anticoagulant to keep the collected blood from clotting.

The device is designed to be less invasive, causing less pain and quicker healing. It's also safer, as the needles are enclosed, reducing the risk of accidental injuries.

This innovation could make blood tests less daunting, especially for those with needle phobia. It's also cheaper and easier to use, making it ideal for areas with limited resources. This could improve disease detection, particularly for conditions like malaria.
